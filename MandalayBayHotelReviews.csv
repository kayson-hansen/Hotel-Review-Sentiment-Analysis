30,They do not tell you they’re going to hold money on your card and take away the funds for your vacation they will try to bill you twice for your resort fee once it check in and once it check out you are not allowed to use the refrigerator in the room for any of your personal items. They will bill you $50 if you open the door.
50,Amazing mini family vacation! This review is geared towards parents with toddlers. If you’re worried about taking kids to Vegas don’t be! We took both our toddler kids and Mandalay Bay is the perfect spot for families. Family friendly and has an amazing pool. I’ll start with the following:    MGM APP. We downloaded the app super easy to use and convenient. Don’t waste your time at the front desk checking in you can do that on the app and use your phone to unlock room door and parking. Each purchase you make is also uploaded quickly on the app so you can track all your purchases during your stay. You can check out with a breeze on it too. I don’t know why people don’t use this and avoid the long check in/out lines.    Pool: amazing pool! The wave/beach pool is for kids 48 inches and taller BUT to the left of that is a kiddie pool and the smaller waves go towards that side so you can just relax on the beach with your kids if they’re still under 48 inches. The lazy river is awesome. TIP – bring your own tubes as they do not rent them. They sell them for $30 each but you can bring in your own and they have an inflation station. If you don’t care for them you’re allowed to go in without them but when it’s crowded you might get bumped. The bigger pool is also nice tons of families go there. I think the deepest was 4 feet. There’s another pool geared towards adults when you first walk in. FYI a 32 oz Miami vice will run you about $30 but so good when it’s hot LOL.    Parking: $18 a night BUT you can park at any of the MGM hotels so it’s kind of nice if you don’t feel like walking strip but want to get closer to another hotel just use the app to open gates at one of the MGM hotels.    Tram: It’s FREE! Kids loved this. It goes from Mandalay Bay to Luxor and then Excalibur and back every 10-15 minutes I believe. We hoped on it a few times to check out Luxor and Excalibur. I will say though Mandalay Bay seemed to have “fresher” air inside. Luxor is nice but you could smell the cigarette smoke more for some reason. Maybe there was a lot more smokers at the hotel not sure.    Room: Clean big and has a huge bath tub the kids loved to go in there. They also have a walk in shower. We stayed in a 2 queen bedroom. Tons of room if you wanted to bring in a twin air mattress or cot for little ones.    We took kids to M&M World Coca Cola Store which is right next to M&M. Hershey store drove to the “welcome to fabulous las Vegas sign” which is just a couple of miles away from hotel. We walked around and took pics at New York New York. Didn’t get a chance to check out the fountains at Bellagio or the free circus act at Circus Circus Hotel but we figured we’d do that next time.    Overall amazing stay and won’t stay at any other hotel from now on. 2 nights went by quick and wish we stayed a 3rd because of pool. It was about 105 degrees (August) when we were there but didn’t feel like it in the pool.
40,The fact that front desk pushes you to mobile check-in and using the app is so rude. If I wanted to mobile check-in or use the app I would but if I stood in line and waiting to speak with someone that means I did not want to do either. So stop making your employees push it on your guests. It makes your employees sound rude and annoys people like me who do not want to download another app for a few days that will take up space and will be delete later.
50,My room was cleaned well daily and had all the amenities I desired. Check in and check out were both very efficient and the charges that were quoted were accurate. There are many excellent restaurants nearby with a wide variety of dining options
30,Everything is ok in Mandalay Bay but the staff is terrible and not helping you what you need they need to learn proper customer service relationship they need to be friendly to everyone not only with the guest
50,We enjoyed our stay and will stay there again. Top notch location and amenities. I wish we received some free play money/rewards but we did not. The casino is huge and has many great shops and restaurants.
30,Just got back from a conference in Mandalay Bay last week. This was my first time in Las Vegas and I have mixed feelings about this hotel. Pros were that it was close to the airport and they have 24hr room service ie. cleaning services. The conference was also here so we didn't have to travel back and forth between places.  The cons were more numerous though. I made a reservation in September and was still unable to get a room with 2 beds (I know there were multiple conferences functioning and it was winter break but I was really hoping to get 2 beds for us). The walls were thin - we could hear our neighboring guests' conversations and alarms clearly. Our room was on the 17th floor and there was a loud metallic screeching sound whenever the wind blew. An extra $50 charge to use the fridge for personal use! And the mini-bar was motion-activated so if you touch any of the objects you have to pay for them ($14 for coffee $24 for bottled water)! The $35/day resort fee was unjustified - I don't need to make phone calls or use the hotel wi-fi or print my boarding pass (I normally don't mind paying resort fees but this one felt unnecessary). I called room service for dinner on Sunday night and no one picked up even after waiting on hold for 15 minutes. I accidentally oped out for daily house keeping but the MGM app said rooms will be cleaned if 3 days of stay or more and our room was not cleaned after 72 hours. I had to call guest services and luckily they operate 24hrs so someone came at 815p. Finally we were unable to get drinks in the casino (asked a waitress passing by and she said someone should have come when the service button was pressed). The food was overpriced ($9 for a slice of pizza $20 for a little bowl of rice and orange chicken $19 for french toast) for the most part. Only Starbucks seemed to be 'normal' prices. Overall we didn't think the food was worth the cost.  Some of these things seem trivial but as a whole they impacted our stay. The hotel itself was lovely and clean and the employees were very nice and helpful. I am assuming most of the hotels on the strip are similar to Mandalay Bay so I would choose a different hotel if I ever return to LV especially since I know what to expect.
50,My wife and I spent 3 lovely days at the Mandalay Bay with our 9.5 year old daughter and the hotel was perfect for us. The 550 square foot standard room was comfortable spacious and fairly modern and the bathroom with soaking tub and multiple sinks was a great feature. All rooms are non-smoking which is a huge plus.    We also really liked the vibe at Mandalay Bay at least in the Winter when the topless pool/beach area is closed and there are fewer gorilla juiceheads monkeying around in Las Vegas generally. The guests were mostly business travelers couples in their 30's through 60's and families with children and the vibe was upscale friendly and laid back. We had some great meals in the Mandalay Bay Shoppes and really liked that the hotel is connected internally to Luxor and Excalibur which both offer family-oriented activities.    Also although it was too chilly for the pool during most of our stay we managed a quick visit to the Moorea Beach Club which has a nicely heated pool and is family friendly/not topless in the Winter and my daughter loved it.    Wonderful stay at Mandalay overall and this is exactly where we'll stay for any future visits. I can already smell the sweet coconut spice aroma that is famously associated with Mandalay Bay.
50,Mandalay was gave us a warm place to stay when we were unable to get back home because of the bad weather. The rooms was clean warm and inviting. Everyone who worked there was very helpful. We will definitely be back!
50,Although the casino was smokier than usual I still love MB. The casino is spacious with plenty of room between machines so you're not on top of each other. The walkways are wide and there are reasonable priced food options. Plus the convenience of Mandalay Place can't be beat! Covered passage to 2 other hotels and shops!
40,The hotel was very clean and spacious I had a great view of the strip. They have a huge tub to relax in. Food is too expensive. My daughter and i ate spaghetti a burger fries and 2 drinks 89.00 without tip. water is 6.00 and the ATM is 8.99 per transaction.
30,Two sets of fake eyelashes were found in our bathroom sink upon arrival. Both my wife and I were not impressed and wondered how well the rest of our room was cleaned. We used tissue paper to remove the eyelashes and flushed them down the toilet. DISGUSTING
50,The room was excellent!! The hotel was amazing!! I would most definitely come back and stay here! The casino was huge and beautiful it was an absolute pleasure staying here! I highly recommend staying here.
50,Nice hotel tons of amenities the house of blues had amazing foood and great music we didn’t gamble much but we did have a wonderful bath in the garden tub a awesome workout in the gym and some great drinks at the many bars.
20,We were very disappointed in our two bedroom suite. We have stayed here for the veterinary conference before and it was great. This time we got an expensive suite that was on the 4th floor. The suite was a little run down a powerstrip behind the bed limited outlets. Faucet in common area wiggly and about to fall off.  Most disappointing was that the view from all windows overlooked a gross roof and parking garage. For a thousand dollars a night I expect a view. This view was NOTHING like the view they advertised on the website.  We spoke with Matthew at customer service and he said call back tomorrow and there should be a better room available. I think he did this to get rid of us. We called back the next day and we got a woman who repeatedly said they are at capacity and we are in the room we paid for. She was quite unsympathetic and had no response when we asked why Matthew had said there would be a better room available.  We asked for compensation and she offered a 50 dollar credit on a $6000 room reservation.  Also disappointing is the $50 charge to put anything in the refrigerator.  Our last visit was great but the room and service this visit was a major disappointment.
40,The room wreaked of mildew that saturated the floor after a toilet bowl flood. Floor was still sticky and soiled.  When asked to change room after concerns of cleanliness and health concerns from mildew spores in the air. Not happy and disappointed.    Absolutely horrible and UNSANITARY!
50,Slept great clear lungs and sinuses softer hair and happier skin plus smartly planned room set up lighted closets bathroom french doors a workspace..also great towels mattress and bedding quiet halls..we loved it.
50,Loved the full size bathtub.  Extra seating for convenience . Was easy to use Uber and also the city bus dropped off in front of the resort. Between the Mandalay Bay and the Excalibur resort is a nice food area and a tram to the other casinos.
10,Do NOT use mobile. You check out they promise a receipt but guess what??? Yep no receipt  Every activity and interaction is designed to get more money from you.  Was there for a conference  Food was horrendous
30,The casino was good. However the hotel service and room was not what I was expecting. My room was not ready. I ended paying for a night that I did not get to use as my room was not ready. The staff refused to give me a refund to find another hotel room. I had to wait for them to clean a room. I got there at 4:00 am with a reservation and was not able to get my room until 6:00 am
10,I don't have anything good to say about our stay at Mandalay Bay. Our room was on the 3rd floor so our only view was of the air conditioners. The mattress felt like it has seen better days. The water throughout the facility tastes and smells heavily chlorinated (maybe to encourage guests to purchase overpriced bottled water). On our final day there we were woken up at 6:30 AM by repetitive scraping/construction noises. It's a casino how about waiting until the afternoon to do things like that?  Breakfast/coffee options are severely limited. At least one day of our stay the line at multiple Starbucks was 1+ hour long. Seabreeze Cafe was overpriced and severely mediocre.  We were told at check in that the contents of the mini bar were motion activated but we assumed they'd be in a cabinet or somehow out of the way. In actuality they're on the counter as you enter the room right where you'd want to drop your keys shopping etc. My partner called the front desk to ask to have them removed so that we couldn't be held liable for additional charges if we accidentally bumped them. After a 2 minute long lecture from the front desk he was told that there would be a $50 charge to remove the mini bar and deactivate the sensor. We chose instead to give it a wide berth and fortunately haven't seen any surprise charges.  They clearly know they have a captive audience and they try to squeeze out every penny they can.
50,This is a great resort with terrific customer service and restaurants. We stayed 1 night and had a blast. The rooms are nice and was quiet. The casino was fun and machines payed out nicely. Restaurants are excellent.
30,Stayed on business last week.    Facilities pretty good and the room was a decent size with a nice view.    Pretty expensive though - the water in the shop cost $19 for 3 bottles.    One thing that spoiled the experience was the SMELL!! Overwhelming sickly coconut fragrance throughout the hotel which by the end of the week started to turn my stomach. Think they probably do it to mask cigarette smells etc but I’d much rather that!!
10,Ice marker didn't work. Took over a hour to get ice delivered. Faster to use stairs to get it yourself from a different floor. Prepaid parking was not loaded to my key card. Potatoe chip crumbs in the bed. GROSS! Therefore clearly the sheets weren't changed from the last guests.
40,Worth paying for rooms are bigger i love the his and her sink bed are comfortable to lay on but pillows are awful then can provide a better quality pillows. Parking spot get really full at night $18.00 parking / day fee is convenient especially if you’re visiting MGM hotels daily
50,Being where it is and being connected to so many other resorts it made it easy to travel without going outside. When you did go outside short walk to the next set of resorts to checkout. This is a must stay.
50,When we received a complementary stay with no resort fees we knew we had to go! Mandalay Bay is a cleaner newer and better smelling resort than many of the other resorts on the strip! Although at one end of the strip there is Easy access to other resorts strip with the tram walking bridges and monorail.
50,We had a minor problem and ***Christin*** at the member check in area took care of it. She is professional polite and friendly. She made our stay extremely enjoyable. I just love how she handles situation without making customers feeling dumb or bad. What a great example of a great customer service. MGM you guys really does a great job training your staff. From CI agents restaurant staff and show performers. It's a program where you feel good while spending your money and don't mind it at all!!!! The Charlie and the chocolate factory gambling machine is so fun it quickly became my favorite. I stayed at Aria early Feb and earlier this week. I love Aria and their outdoor spa! But this time I found out I love Mandalay Bay too!!! I can't wait to go back to Mandalay Bay.
50,Our room was comfortable clean and quiet. It also provided a nice view of the Strip. A cap ride is needed to get to the main part of the Strip but I would definitely consider staying here on our next visit!
40,The hotel was very nice and clean.  I came for conference almost every year for 5 years and this was the first time that I stayed here. The room was very clean and nice but there was no space to put any water in the refrigerator and the coffee was also not free. All the snack and beverages was over charged which is typical for hotels. But the staff was nice and facility was clean.
50,Very impressed with mobile check in and overall accommodations. Lots of food choices and everything was easy to locate. Didn’t appreciate the $24 bottles of water that were in the room but that’s about it. I would stay again.
10,Insane front desk lines minimal food options no water or coffee or refrigerators in room. Very thin walls could hear everything in room next to mine. Front desk staff not nice. Elevators didn't work much of the time.
30,The rooms were very average. We stayed in the Stay Well Rooms and they were NOT anything special. It is the first on The Strip so it is very far away from a lot of activities. The mid week room price is OK but I have NOT seen my final bill. Need a lot of improvement. Pools were closed due to it being in February.
40,Hallway was too loud. Like a party at 4 am. Incidental charges for basic services like a refrigerator are upsetting. Room was nice but I felt like if I touched anything I would be charged. No coffee available on site 24/7
10,Mandalay Bay use to be the nicest casino with exceptional staff. Now staff acts like they are better than you and are just unwilling to do anything to help. If you ask a question everyone acts like you are wasting their time.
40,No amenities without having to pay for every little thing. The room was very nice and the beds were very comfortable. The room service was good and everything was clean. For the price we paid for the room I wouldn't have expected to have to pay extra to use all of the hotel amenities.
10,Poor quality food and didn’t get cutlery. Had to call twice to get cutlery delivered. Took over 45 minutes to get it after I got my food. 2nd night no cutlery either. Hard to eat salad and pasta with fingers. Room was freezing heat on but cold coming from large windows.
40,Clean environment. The beds were comfortable. Their tubs were relaxing. Plenty of gaming and entertainment near by. Easy to find Uber pick up locations. Public restrooms were very clean. Staff very helpful
20,The rooms were old and not to my expectations. Check in was down to the last minute and communication did not meet my expectations till I went back to VIP check in and ask what was going on… we waited until 3:30 and finally received our rooms . I know check in is t till 3:30 or 4:00 pm.
50,Great service and room quality for excellent price. The Starbucks had very friendly service and high quality food and drinks for a reasonable price. Blair at the check in was a kind person and extra helpful. We can’t thank him enough. He set the tone for our experience
50,beautiful and comfortable accommodations. great and a variety of dining. friendly and courteous staff. excellent views. check in and check out quick and east. would definitely return for another stay.
50,Love the well spaced out room with bouble vanity works really well. Amazing bathtub that helped relax after a long night. Very friendly staff and was help fairly quick at check in. My complements to the housekeeping staff that kept our room clean.
10,Sensor on snack bar. $50 fee for fridge.    Rude management.  Sounded like construction above us last night there.    Classic captive audience overpriced.    Guest services talks down to you.    Corporate is evil...
50,Western Veterinary Conferences wouldn’t be the same staying anywhere else. I stay there every year and I’m never disappointed. The rooms are spacious and clean the elevators run like clockwork (major bonus at a busy conference!) and everything is within walking distance (wear good walking shoes!). Parking is straightforward and even with the Golden Knights’ home game on there was plenty of parking to be had. The staff are really cool folk too. That’s why I keep going back.
30,Needs a refresh. Rooms are tired and ready for an update. My room was not cleaned sufficiently and wait for a room was 3 hours after hotel policy of 3 pm check in. Being a convention hotel it needs to be ready for returning guests.
50,We asked the front desk if there were an suite upgrade we can get to our room since it was not ready and WOW! The front desk person was amazing and offered us a suite upgrade with a minimal charge and it was the best decision ever. The suite was huge and beautiful with floor to ceiling windows and a view of the stadium.
30,Average hotel. Equal to $119 Double Tree. You have to pay to use a refrigerator in your room that is included at a Hampton Inn. Windows are noisy when the wind blows about the top 10 floors. Restaurants are good just pricy. Convention center is very nice for shows.
40,Was overall pleased with the Mandalay. Shops were a little expensive but the restaurants were delicious and not too overpriced.  Would have loved more options for hot coffee. Conference area was great. Staff smiled and were all helpful and polite. Check in was easy and check out was on my phone. Love the Uber / pick up area - was safe and patrolled by security.
10,Have been going for over 30 years for conventions and now after 5 years tried again and will never return. Hotels outrageously expensive and nickel and dime everything. Waited over 2.5 hours to eat each night and no buffets any more as backup place to be able to eat. Not the same atmosphere in the casinos - less tables and a lot more LCD screen games everywhere - not enticing at all.
20,Great room and environment but staff is not friendly: check in staff and bar tenders don't want to serve drinks they tell you to go ask a waitress. The restaurants are nice and there are a lot of options to chose from .
10,Air was dry in the hotel room and the lines were very long. The smoking of cigarettes cigars and vape caused a gross smell as you walk Around the casino and sections of the hotel. The gym was extremely small for a hotel if this size.
10,Perhaps this is standard in Las Vegas but I find it shocking that basic amenities like coffee are not provided. And the e refrigerator literally has a sign that says “the refrigerator is not for personal guest you” and goes on to say you can pay $50 extra per day if you want a mini fridge to keep your personal items.  Red Roof Inn offers better amenities!
20,The hotel was just okay. I expected more for the price per night. Staff was rude and dismissive. We had an issue with our window whistling all night our final night there with a 4 hours early flight home then next day. It was whistling because they used tape to try and fix the frame and with the wind blowing up through it it was making a horrible sound. Front desk was dismissive when we mentioned it and said they had other people mention it as well.
30,The room was left with a completely full garbage can little bits of hair from someone shaving in the tub and grime in the corners of the shower. I’m guessing this is because I got a standard room which still cost me a grand for the several days there. Probably wouldn’t be seen in a suite but cleanliness should be a top priority. Other than that the room itself was nice. I enjoyed the spacious bathroom and layout of it. Hotel casino and conference staff all very nice. Would definitely have liked to have seen more than three food options near the conference center.
40,great resort needs a little fine tuning but great place to stay with family. Book you reservations ahead since they usually have conventions and events at mandalay Bay. Fav Restaurants: KUMI Sushi and Noodle Shop.
50,Check-in was great as Gold MGM we were given a great room on the 59th Floor with a fantastic strip view. Room was clean and in good shape and everything worked well. Mandalay is a bit far from the action as far as mid strip is concerned but if you dont mind getting some steps in its not really a problem. The walk to the Park MGM tram is easy and from there its a short tram ride into Bellagio at the heart of the strip. You can also take the tram from Mandalay to Excalibur but I dont feel its necessary as the walk through the 3 casinos to the New York New New York bridge is pretty quick and easy with lots of moving walkways. Overall a great stay would highly recommend.
50,Rooms and casino are clean. Was not smoky like many of the others. Lots of shopping and dining options. Check in on the app was easy and self park was well-marked. I like the location of this hotel (at the end of the strip). Made it so easy to get in and out with our car... which I did not expect.
10,"This is the second time staying here and I will not stay here again. The wifi does NOT work everything buffers forever! The rooms are small for the price the snacks in your room are: $24 for water $13 for a coke $13 for the M&M's and if you touch them/or knock them over you will be charged since they are censored. Don't get me started when they say they have a gym (and charge a $40 resort fee that covers ""the gym"") it is a small room with 10 treadmills and 12 dumbbells (they didn't have one dumbbell weight I needed (12lb/15lb/30lb) but they do have a gym with tons of machines and weights for $30 fee! Really MGM you lost me there! AND there is no fridge in the rooms for your own food/snacks/wine etc. Plus my friend got robbed in the casino (he got tackled and charged) so watch your stuff! The one thing they do well is their beach pool (which was not open) so they have that one thing going for them. But beware many of the restaurants don't open until evening so if you come for a convention you are stuck with the food court. Not worth it! Stay somewhere else before you stay here!"
30,This use to be a great place to stay. Unfortunately they try to rely on an app based check in system…. Sometimes it workssometimes it doesn’t. They got incredibly greedy with the rewards program  you can’t really achieve much in the program without opening a credit card though them or staying about 6 months out of the year? We use to stay here at least twice out of each year for over 10-12+ nights a year. Not worth it anymore…. They just got greedy… stay at a non MGM property  your money will go much farther.
50,Mandalay Bay always the best hotel to check in. Staff is Friendly! 5 Star! Highly Recommended! Cleanliness is outstanding! Bathroom ans Rooms are very modern and Clean! Carpet is newly renovated!!!!!
30,Bed was way too hard bed sheets or towels gave my guest and I a rash vitamin c shower doesn’t work at all  Didn’t let us know security deposit before hand parking was confusing didn’t want to read room cards to go in and out of garage didn’t let us know about rewards programs
50,We came here for the Michael Jackson One show. Considering that I know how long the hotel has been around it is really quite amazing how well the Mandalay Bay has been kept up. I say that compared to the hotel we stayed at nearby that has definitely shown its age. The theater was well kept the casino was comfortable and clean and the decor overall has stayed relevant. I still remember coming here years ago for an amazing dinner at Aureole with the wine angels and it is still here. I think they did some work on the place when they added the Delano hotel tower. I want to come back again and stay here.
10,For the 3rd time here the front desk seems too busy to help out. I thought the first time was because they were understaffed due to COVID. But they’re consistently not very helpful. Housekeeping staff is always amazing tho! The app sucks it doesn’t work and if you ask someone to help they’ll tell you to figure it out yourself. And keep trying later cos it might work.
30,$14 for brew your own in room coffee. Inadequate fitness center very small and multiple machines broken Very poor wifi with very poor internet connectivity. Staff friendly and plentiful. Appreciate 11am check out.
30,The hotel is a great hotel they have a great restaurants and the staff is friendly. However I am giving a three stars rating because you would never expect to have things stolen from your make up bag in a five-star hotel. I am a make up artist and travel with many high quality make up face brushes. Three of them were stolen from my bag. While I do put away computers jewelry and documents in the safe deposit box I never put away my makeup which normally I live over the makeup table or desk. I was really disappointed.
40,Other than the mishap in the shower (Found hair on the walls) Everything else was good a lot to do at the Casino. Food wise or Entertainment. Plenty of table games and things to do. A little overcrowded due to convention or volleyball tournament so a lot of children.
20,Stayed one night at Mandalay Bay and while the room was quite nice and seemed clean and well maintained I doubt we would stay here again. For the price we paid we were offended that this hotel could not manage to place two small bottles of regular water in the rooms not specialty water that cost the guests $30 per bottle !! And to charge for mistakingly opening the mini bar fridge ! Luckily we saw the “little” sign that noted that. Why not just have an empty mini fridge in the guest rooms for the guests personal use ????? Or none at all. What a gimmick ! The person who checked us in was all business no welcome greeting and she needs to learn how to smile ! Also the $39 resort fee is ridiculous what is that even for. We were never informed of what that even entailed by the unfriendly person who registered us. And the $40 dollar valet charge a little steep for one night ! The friendliest person we encountered was the person who came to take our luggage out the morning of our departure he was helpful in directions to the valet area to retrieve our vehicle. Other options in Vegas I would not choose this place again.
10,I cannot recommend this hotel. We paid a high price for a Saturday night stay and were given a room with a bathroom that had pipes that made loud horrible noises all night. We couldn’t sleep. The staff at the front desk did not offer an apology or remedy. They rendered the room out of service.
50,We stayed in one of MB’s “Stay Well” rooms in February and were very pleased with our room. The air purifier and aromatherapy was a great addition and worth the added cost. Border Grill offered delicious Mexican food at reasonable prices and Kumi had amazing sushi. I would definitely stay here again!
40,The room was nice but you couldn't access the mini fridge without paying $50/day. The items inside and snack on top were also way overpriced. Everything was also weight sensitive so if you accidentally bumped into the table it would charge you. Overall the room was nice but not sure it was worth the price.
40,Overall a great place to stay if you’re in Vegas. One of the best also from what friends have told us about other hotels in Vegas. Less noise b/c of the location. Clean rooms comfortable bed. The Stay Well rooms are the ones to get in our opinion.
10,Completely ruined my vacation. Charged my card 29 different times. Was embarrassed by hotel staff because they messed up my bill. They give u a mini bar but God forbid your son takes a soda from it! They started getting all weird acting like your not going to pay for it. Don't offer it then!!!!! Ghetto hotel!!!
50,"We hadn't stayed at Mandalay Bay in a few years. We had a blast! Blair at check-in started us off on the right foot. Ate at Ri-Ra (delicious fish and chips and a burger) StripSteak for a birthday dinner (outstanding cowboy ribeye foie gras beef tartare; avoid the fried rice) and Seabreeze (relaxing breakfast). Robert Steven and ""lona"" were our servers all excellent. Also visited the foundation room for charcuterie and a couple glasses of wine. Room was very nice (24221 stripview) bathroom is a little outdated but overall comfortable and quiet. Housekeeping was spot on. The ice machine was broken so that was a pain. Spent most of our four day trip just hanging out. Machines were not too tight. Table limits (blackjack and craps) were too high for me ($25-$50). Ugh. Went downtown to gamble. We thought the location might be too far down the strip but it was OK and there is a liquor store McDonalds and a grocery right across the street. All in all it was a great stay. We were well taken care of. I'd definitely go back again."
50,The room was large the view was great and I love the huge tub that fits two. The service fir check in to check out was awesome. You feel welcomed and the casino floor has all that you need. The food was always top notch.
10,The resort smelled terrible. The room was expensive and yet they try and scam you like a budget motel. Weight activated mini bar where they charge you for anything you take. They charge you $50 to be able to put your own items in the mini fridge. Trashy and a rip off.
40,Nice but a bit away from Strip. Everything was as expected. Comfortable beds and not a crowded casino.  Not sure why I have to write a review that has a minimum amount of characters but for some dumb reason you do here.
50,The hotel is beautiful clean and the staff is friendly. I enjoyed several of the restaurants. I attended a convention and everything was organized and put together very well. The staff knows the area and is able to provide directions and information.
40,We had an amazing stay. The hotel is beautiful. We stayed on the 30th floor. The view was spectacular. You can see straight down the the Vegas strip. There’s a lot of restaurants and bars The only issue we had is there was no microwave in our room.
10,"This is my first stay at Mandalay Bay and I can assure you it will be my last. While the room is gorgeous and there are lots of amenities here I have never experienced worse customer service. I woke up at 2 AM thirsty went to vending machine to get a soda but when I returned to my room neither of my room keys worked. I embarrassedly went to the front desk in my pajamas to get a new key and found a line of about 7 groups waiting to check in. There was no one else available to help so I got in line. After realizing each check-in was taking at least 5 minutes and the line was not moving I waved to one of the staff who was getting ready to wave over the next customer. I explained my situation and asked if anyone could simply reset my key. The attendant actually wanted me to wait in that line which clearly would have been another 20 minutes at least. In my pajamas! Fortunately the couple who was next in line was more compassionate than the Mandalay Bay attendant and they let me go next. The Mandalay Bay employee was short with me never apologized that this had happened just apologized to the couple who had let me go in front of them. I couldn't believe this was how the hotel wanted customers treated so when I returned to my room I called and asked to speak to a manager. The manager Andrew thought I should have waited my turn in line behind those who were fully dressed waiting to check in.  I reiterated that I was in my pajamas and the fact that both of my keys would not work was not my fault. He did not get why that mattered and refused to give me his supervisor's name. I went to the Mandalay Bay website to email a complaint but apparently they do not care about customers enough to even have a way to file a complaint. So here I am at 2:51 AM writing this review. Two final comments - check in is supposedly at 3 PM but when I arrived at 4:30 PM I was told it could be as late as 6 PM before my room was ready and 3 PM is just when check-ins ""could"" begin. And finally the two housekeeping employees I encountered yesterday were incredibly kind and helpful. If only the front desk employees and managers were as caring as the housekeeping staff."
40,My daughter and I stayed here in two parts. Part one was for one night as we were seeing One and flew in especially to see the show. We were very happy with the hotel and absolutely loved the show. We then returned to hotel 8 nights later after being in New York. This time we were in the stay well rooms. Had a great view from our window. The hotel is excellent. It is not insanely busy like many of the hotels on the strip. We loved Hazels Bar for a drink and listen to some music. The whole complex has a relaxed vibe and that really appealed to us. It is a walk to many of the other hotels but I think it is worth it as when you return to the hotel from walking the strip it feels like a retreat. Unfortunately pools not open. The bar fridge and the charges for that are ridiculous and I think the hotel should rethink that. To charge you to keep a bottle of water or your own drink or food cold is a bit off. I note that many hotels don’t have the guest information they used to have in the rooms and I would love to see them back. The price we paid was very good even for us poor Aussies who have to deal with the conversion rate.
20,TV needed a repair. Mobile key card/app was unreliable. The corridor from the hotel to the convention center smelled foul (not just cigarette smoke). That said the rooms felt clean and the bed was comfortable.
50,The trip was very nice great service close to lots of stuff to do. Great restaurants. Room was perfect big clean great view. I would definitely go again. I highly recommend to stay here for future trips .
30,None of the bars opened before 10 AM in the morning HOW CAN THAT BE? There were few if any cocktail waitresses very disappointing. The hotel was quiet but far off of the strip and the tram didn’t start until 10:AM BAD
50,I went to Mandalay Bay with friends over Superbowl weekend. We had a blast at the hotel and really enjoyed the atmosphere. The restaurants at the hotel were terrific and we especially loved the Noodle House. The rooms were terrific and had a vert large bathroom. Recommend.
50,This was my first trip to Vegas. It was awesome. The hotel stay was so peaceful calm relaxing very clean rooms. Staff was excellent and my MGM reward points were helpful. Thank you Vegas. My first experience was great!
50,we love to stay here. The rooms are large and always very clean. Can't wait until its summer so we could come and enjoy the pools. We did have our young son with us. Having the tram to the Excalibur was very nice. We were able to take him to the arcade.
10,$14 for In-Room Coffee $16 for In-Room Bottled Water. Not Room Service - but the coffee you make and the water they stock in your room. I understand they are a for-profit operation...but REALLY?!?! 1400%+ markup for water and coffee?? Oh and if you get your own water off-site and use the mini-fridge they charge you $50. To top it off the bed was horrible it had a huge slope from middle to edge felt like I was rolling off all night. I rarely write reviews but they need to hear that their greed is ridiculous. DO NOT STAY AT MANDALAY BAY.
50,I have been going to Las Vegas for more than 20 years. I've stayed at several MGM properties but it is the people and service at Mandalay Bay that will keep me returning for years to come. This trip was for my mom's 78th birthday. From the front desk team to all of the shopping and dining outlets everyone was wonderful. I was specifically like to think Maria at check in who ran around and help guest in line. She made the trip special for my mom and we grew to love her just in a few days that we were there. She is one of the reasons that I will always come back. The same goes for the ladies at the seabreeze Cafe. They made this trip special. They went over and above even when they didn't have to. I've worked in hospitality for Hilton Marriotta and private equity firms for years. I know good hospitality when I see it. Vegas is a great hospitality town hands down but for an elevated experience in a lot of joy Mandalay Bay cannot be beaten.
50,Great pools amazing rooms shopping and dining options. You can walk across the street to other eating options liquor store to save some extra bucks. Catch the tram that runs frequently takes you to Excalibur- definitely a feet saver. Overall love this resort!
50,Great customer service staff was extremely helpful rooms were very comfortable all in all everything was great awesome experience have never stayed that the Mandalay Bay but will recommend to all my friends thank you so much for a great time
40,We found confetti and on the carpet and several sequins and debris in the bathroom from previous guests. Certainly makes me think other areas were probably not cleaned as well as they should have Benn. Also found several hairs on the bed which was pretty gross.
50,My boyfriend and I had an amazing stay. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. We also had a great time going to the shark reef plus the VR experience. The shark reef was very cool and the staff were willing to share all sorts of facts about the animals.
50,Everything about this casino/hotel is extremely well thought out including its location: we had a room with an unobstructed view down the Vegas strip. And the Super Bowl Party was definitely memorable.
10,The room was dirty when we arrived but they did leave us a free half empty bottle of pepsi in the mini fridge! We were in a 1bdrm suite with a 1/4 sized shower and no water pressure. I purchased the coffee from the mini bar and then discovered that the in room coffee maker didn't work. Oh and the best part...housekeeping enters your room whether you want them to or not but ONLY when you're NOT there so make sure you don't leave anything of importance out when you leave the room.
10,Mandalay bay charged me $60.00 for 2 Fiji water bottles. That's ridiculous price gouging. They had no interest in working with me on this matter also acting like the charge was reasonable. Pretty sh!tty services.
50,I organized a team meeting at the Mandalay for a group of 35. 3 days of meetings with various team members arriving and departing on different days. Sales catering A/V and group room reservations were very accommodating with all my request - even the last minute items. They made everything run smoothly. Our dinners at La Fleur and Kumi where amazing.
50,The Mandalay offers a beautiful experience and top quality service. It contains many fine restaurants and entertainment headlined by Michael Jackson cirque show and Carlos Santana's residency at the House of Blues.
50,We have been mLife members for a number of years. These last few years our casino host David Scarpace and the penthouse lounge host Anjuli have been the absolute best people who always look out for their guests best interests and experiences.    David as a host has continually went above and beyond what we expect from rooms booked to surprise drinks/champagne in our room upon arrival. He has been one of the reasons why we look forward to our trips to Vegas.    Anjuli the penthouse lounge host is the other reason why we enjoy our stay at Mandalay Bay. She works hard to make sure every guest she talks to is well taken care of and has what they need to enjoy their stay.    The last one is David at the House of Blues Foundation Room restaurant. You need to go and check it out for the views great food and he’s one we always recommend to our friends….he’ll take care of you.
40,YEAH! Las Vegas exists after COVID we were finally able to return the last time was in 2019 on the occasion of our wedding anniversary this time we chose Mandalay Bay to continue celebrating (39 years old) we always stay at VDara on this occasion MLife rewards us prize with very good accommodation prices and we could not say no
10,My wife had to wait 5 hours for me to get there to check in. They follow policies that are broken between them and their partners (Priceline) and make the customer suffer. Managers do not even try to find a solution
40,The property was beautiful and had a lot to offer. I wish it had been warmer so we could have enjoyed the pools. However it is massive and required a lot of walking just from the parking garage and it was pretty noisy throughout the night to the point that we could hear people arguing in the hallways and the room next door.
40,I would give it a 5 but in room charges were ridiculous. Bottled water was $24.00. Service throughout resort was great! The Noodle restaurant was very good highly recommend. The service there was excellent and quick. I don't remember the name!
50,We went to Vegas to celebrate my Son's 21st Birthday =). Everyone from the check in valet bell services house keeping and host were amazing! They were so friendly to our little fur babies too!! Thank you so much for your hospitality.
50,Fresh outside air from a window vent. Live music options. A free band had us up dancing till 1 an on Friday. House of Blues. Many Fine Dinning options at a very reasonable price. Decorum was very elegant with Character but without that sterile/stiff feeling. Especially loved the carpets. Staff second to nome. Over the last 4 years we have stayed at the Wynn Venetian Paris Caesars Palace Aria Luxor Golden Gate and Circa. Mandalay Bay is our overall favorite Hotel. The tram did assist greatly and is free. Yes we are in Vegas a lot.
30,My room was dirty when checked in. They gave me a drink coupon when I complained. The staff at the front desk seemed annoyed that there were several people checking in at the same time instead of using virtual check in.
30,Rooms surrounding our room were flooded with fans down the hall with loud noises from the rooms being fixed I have pics and video of the hallway and room noise. Not sure why they would put guests on that floor
50,Great first time experience here! We enjoyed our stay and we would definitely come back ! Staff was nice Super Bowl was showing everywhere throughout the casino and restaurants really no complaints here.
50,Happy camper! Service could be slow. Superbowl weekend. Service was better in past. I think it is difficult to hire good help and more help. Overall i was extremely happy. Superbowl help alot better in past. I will come back.
50,Rooms were clean and quit. Lots of eating places to choose from. Plenty of gambling room. Great entertainment with plenty of partying places. Good location with plenty of things to do with good access.
50,I say world class because I work for Pebble Beach Resorts a world class golf resort. I know what it takes to go that extra mile for guests and I see it here at Mandalay Bay (as well as Delano) so we will be back (we go twice a year) and always here
50,It was our first trip to Vegas at we stayed at Mandalay Bay. Beautiful hotel and casino with so much going on. Rooms are clean and made everyday. Staff is extremely helpful in exposing the rules on how to gamble(I knew how to play blackjack just not the rules of the table)
30,Dealers were horrible and hotel needs updating. Overall hotel has gone down in service and quality. Better hotels with better location. Dealers talk to you like you owe them something and pit bosses as well.
40,Rooms could be a bit cleaner. Found hairs from who I’m assuming are the house keeping on my bed and in the shower when I first checked in. Also I would like if it was easier to get ahold of someone instead of getting the operator
50,Everything was great from being able to check in with the app as well being able to check out . Rooms were nice and comfortable. Very clean as well . As far as restaurants everything was amazing . Was able to try Lupo steak was amazing  had breakfast at Citizen service and food was great . Over all everything was excellent.
30,"The Mandalay Bay is a beautiful property and we had a very nice room. We booked through a rewards program and did not know there would be $44 in charges for each day --- ""Resort Fee"" Also if you picked up the mini bar items left out you were charged whether you used them or not. I had to call to get a $14 charge taken off after I got home. I had picked it up to look at it and then put it down. I didn't see the sign explaining because I had put my carry on down in front of it. They did remove the charge when I called. The shower did not work properly because it was impossible to regulate the temperature. When I called to report the problem no one answered."
50,Attended the Adele concert and happened to find the hotel early for a great discount. Beautiful hotel great food Hazel's has the best coffee in the morning. If you have a chance to stay at the Mandalay Bay do it.
20,Went to Mandalay on a business trip. Because of that all MGM Rewards options were voided. Nothing mentioned about it during redemption. When trying to redeem points I was told that because my company was paying for the room rewards are not eligible. Why would a paid room for me not be?
20,They charge for everything. Water bottles in the room are not complementary $50 to use the in room fridge forget about complementary in room coffee. Don’t move any of the snacks because they’re all on sensors. Table minimums are $25 most times. If you are on a $15 table they will raise the minimum and you will be required to bet the new minimum.
40,Mandalay Bay is a great stay during my Birthday Weekend. Great staff and restaurants. The staff was great with recommendations and information of tourism in Vegas. The room was great and big. The only is the charge for if you eat or drink anything in the room and the location of the hotel. At the end of the strip.
30,I remember this hotel is being luxurious and high end. Now it seems like a very large glorified version of a Holiday Inn express. Room service was not service at all everything I ordered -the not so friendly person on the other end of the line just kept telling me “there’s a charge for that there’s a charge for that.” I know this room service is the most expensive meal on the planet I expect it. You don’t have to tell me. Check in was annoying you don’t talk to anybody and it doesn’t go right so when you finally do talk to someone -they are friendly but why do the whole electronic thing when you have to go through the whole process again? The rooms are dated but the bathroom and bathtub is exceptional which is my favorite part. Not somewhere gambling is favored and there’s only one place and restaurant that’s open 24 hours everywhere closes early. Shopping is just OK. Service all around while friendly is just not customer service oriented. It’s definitely “for the man”. They might as well just demolish it along with the Luxor .
40,This was my first time staying at Mandalay Bay. I usually stay at some of the higher end resorts. I wanted to try something different for a few days. I looked through the MGM resorts and compared the reviews. I'm glad I settled on this one. Just needs to do more dusting and it would be a great stay.
40,I went to Mandalay Bay for my honeymoon. I arrived late and the king room had a door to the adjacent room which we could hear normal conversations. So we had to wait for the next night to ask for an upgrade for minimal cost. I loved the Delano room. The only issue is that the pool access is through Mandalay Bay. Then a walk to the pool. No changing rooms at the pool!
50,The minute you get out of your taxi your greeted with a aroma of the islands They must be pumping in that aroma and I love it! Rooms are exceptional the Casino is the most vastly open space on the strip and their pool complex is the best in Vegas. Excellent food choices. Mandalay Bay is the place to go!
10,Don’t stay here if looking for friendly bartenders or casino experience.  Rude. Will consider other casino in future. Even a not nice room with friendly staff is superior to this prejudice place. Go elsewhere!!
40,The hotel is clean and smells clean. The hotel is away from the noisy strip.  The bed and pillows are comfortable.  The Noodle restaurant in the hotel serves excellent quality Asian food. Highly recommend the Singapore Noodle All the soups the lumpia the curry the orange chicken and Mongolian beef. The breakfast restaurant. The Seabreeze Cafe is an excellent place for breakfast/ brunch the brioche French toast is yum yum yummy!!!
40,Overall nice hotel and staff . But last location on the strip based on my other stays in Vegas is the worst spot . How every I was on a family trip the hotel is great for groups. They need better quick food options
50,Our trip to Mandalay Bay was great. The casino floor was very wide and clean. It was not overcrowded at all. Also the room was really nice. As to restaurants we really enjoyed the Chinese food at the Noodle Shop. The food was of great quality and the service was wonderful.
30,Property showing age. Registration staff rude and unpleasant. WOULD NOT RETURN TO PROPERTY. There are too many properties in Vegas to have bad service dirty rooms unclean greasy showers. So disappointing.
50,Staying in Vegas seems to have a much higher base cost than it once did. But then maybe I'm just getting to the age where drastic change feels abrasive.    Have to fill this remaining %25 of space but I have no parting pearls of wisdom and no further opinions at this time.
50,Staff was very helpful particularly the concierge's desk. Very courteous pleasant and knowledgeable. Floating staff person at checkout noted that I used a cane and ensured that I obtained a veterans MGM card and that our checkout was expedited. Ambiance was very pleasant. A great place for guests with varied tastes. We'll be back.
30,The rooms were clean and comfortable. The mini bar system is ridiculous! It is motion sensor if you open the fridge you will be charged $50.00. If any item on the snack tray is MOVED you will be charged. So even if it is knocked over accidentally you get charged for the item/s. To have the tray removed from the room there is a $50.00 charge.
20,had no running water at couldn't even move me to another room had to leave Casino to go clean up very disappointing that they couldn't help me had to go back to gym to take shower very so mad whole reason why I reserved this suite was for large size tube that I was unable to use cause of no running water
10,Don't waste your money or time here. It was my absolute worst trip to Vegas EVER! From check-in to check-out. It was all a nightmare! No fun at all! No coffee in the room unless you want to spend $14 per cup and the customer service was the worst I have ever experienced.
50,Very classy  rooms are so clean  very big and beds are very comfortable. Staff was extremely helpful. Bathrooms are so unique. I would love to be back. Pricey but worth it…definitely. An interesting thing  your key cards are only accessible to the room level you are staying in. You are not allowed to access any other floors. Very safe
40,Good hotel. No screaming kids and no drunk moron dingleberries. Nice. New 1923 prohibition bar is smooth. Holy cow I gotta do 95 more characters? What’s next a book report? Spare parts bud. The Wolfgang puck restaurant was great. And RiRa for Irish breakfast is amazing.
10,No water coffee in the room and you wanted to charge us for putting the water we bought with out money because we stored it in your fridge we couldn’t connect to the Wi-Fi because the service was week . You’re charging too much and you can’t provide good internet service? Unbelievable
30,Nothing special. Rude management staff amd my bathroom was dirty upon check in. Much better places to stay in the area. I will pass on this Mandalay during my next las vegas vacation. The casino was nice but not much else.
50,I have had an exceptional experience at Mandalay Bay Resort.. Friendly staff and clean hotel rooms.. From Casino to room service the resort accommodation was excellent and will definitely visit again!
50,Very comfortable rooms with super friendly staff!  The casino floor was well laid out bars were fun felt secure and safe.  Had one of the greatest nights sleep I ever had in a hotel.  Loved the Hazel Bat coffee every morning!
20,It looks nice but they charge for every move u make.$12 for a btl of water/ coffee in the ROOM. $50 to use fridge. It feels cheesy.They make a ton of profit they cant comp H2O or sip of coffee? Lame.
50,My wife and I stayed at the Mandalay Bay Resort for our anniversary. Had a great time there. The staff was polite and helped us with anything we needed. This resort is awesome we love the lounge/bar Eye Candy and the Foundation Room which are both on property and have an fun vibe. Won some money playing slots and listened to live music as well. We have stayed at other MGM properties and Mandalay lines up with all the other on great places to visit. We will definitely stay there again soon.
50,Trabajo conferencia atención for l the the location the signs everything ha the appropriate information to walk en communication to the another hotel swrvice of the tram and all the area is super clean
30,Property is very outdated and not the cleanest but it is a fair price and rooms are decent it is located furthest away from the strip and you’ll need to walk taxi or Uber. Pools were all being repaired but one and the bar service at the pool is so so.
50,I really enjoyed my stay at the Mandalay Bay. This was a trip for my birthday. The hotel was beautiful and the room were excellent. The service was amazing. The view from my room was awesome. I enjoyed my stay.
50,Great view I was lucky enough to get a room with strip view.  Upgrade to the bathroom is required…at-least people should be able to take a proper shower. Very bad toiletries.  Other than the mini bar quality is same as a 3 star hotel.
50,Had a wonderful time with my family …there was great service and kids enjoyed all the activities and …had a wonderful time for my birthday and we definitely plan on bring the family and I back again sometime soon
50,Spent my birthday here with my adult daughter. The room was clean and very comfortable. Great luxury for the price and the staff is amazing. Options for dining were great and the hotel smells wonderful. My room had a view of the strip and the beds were so comfy!! Excellent experience I’ll be returning soon.
30,Room was dirty. Coke stains under the glass of the dresser. No usable fridge. Constantly worried about moving the “move and have to buy” items. Dried pee on the walls of little room where the toilet was. HVAC failed in hall and blowers were going for entire stay. Tripped over cords in hallway a few times.
50,Loved loved loved it so clean! So friendly everything about it was just perfect! Felt like home but like Vegas home!!! Would visit again and again if I could l.  Restaurants are amazing and parking is too convenient.
30,As a loyal mgm/mlife customer we always primarily stayed at the Mirage and Aria. Decided to give Mandalay a try since mirage was sold. Location horrible but we knew that going in. Entire hotels lighting is dark and grim and hotel has no energy puts u to sleep almost. Lots of broken walkways elevator buttons etc throughout property. Staff was friendly. They really need to pick up the energy in this hotel. Last thing u want on vacation is to be lulled to sleep with dark lighting and warm casinos. We ended up gambling mostly in other hotels because of this.
50,Always a great time! Rooms are great! Had a tub and shower with a view of pool! Great stay! Wi-Fi was a bit off but checkin was easy and staff were exceptional. Will definitely be looking to come back soon!
50,Wow Mandalay Bay has everything and more. We stayed there the whole time. We went to a Santana Concert Saturday Played Slots all of Sunday went on a Pink Jeep Tour Monday and Left Tuesday morning. The room was spacious and beautiful and we had so many places to choose from to eat. It was a fantastic getaway!
50,Had an amazing time starting from the valet to my room. Even tho I had a back of the hotel view it was still amazing. The room was beautiful and clean and it smelled great! Looking forward to my next stay.
50,Hotel room and bathroom with his and her sinks🙌👍😊. The hotel offers many restaurants to choose from as well as a food court. The casino was less crowded than most. Staff was friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay here in the future.
50,Softball tournament trip coupled with some Vegas sightseeing. We were booked at one hotel which we promptly checked out of and quickly booked with Mandalay. Arrived to a very friendly staff and wonderful accommodations. Absolutely will book there first next time! Lesson learned.
50,I haven't been to Las Vegas for over 2 yrs now and I notice some changes like adding shopping area connecting to luxor. It was a nice addition. I always like staying in mandalay because It was nice and clean but most especially it was not in the center of strip where it could get very crowded.
50,Rooms were very nice and clean! Loved housekeeping. The staff overall were pleasant and helpful. The bell worker gave us ideas of where to eat and best places to shop. Everyone here did a great job! Will indeed return!
40,Very good location and wonderful staff. Everything is labeled well as far as direction. Plenty of things to do and enjoy inside of the hotel as well as directly outside. Not too far from the wild part of Vegas but still far enough to not deal with crowds.
50,Very clean need more signs with directions! Everything was clean and very nice employees!!!!!!!!!!!!  The food is good parking is kind of expensive 36 dollars for 2 days. Rooms are very nice and comfortable
20,8th year at MB for trade show. Nothing has changed and it's getting pretty boring. Additionally the location is not near anything on the strip. Next time even if I have to Uber every morning I will stay up the strip.
50,Excellent customer service clean beautiful resort great location-not far from everything highly recommended to anyone that’s on business family vacation or both. We didn’t experience any issues during our stay. Beds are very comfortable!!
50,The hospitality is absolutely amazing!!!! Every time we check in and we are always greeted warmly and respectfully; it never feels like we are being handled. The rooms are also immaculate!!! I sleep like baby when I stay. Also this was my first time dining at one of the on site restaurants and even the food was amazing and I will add very reasonably priced. I would stay here over and over again and I definitely recommend this resort.
50,I took my husband to Vegas for his birthday and to attend the pro bowl. I choose Mandalay Bay because it was located across the highway from the stadium. It was a great experience. Very friendly staff check in was easy room was clean and nice bed was very comfy. Loved the aquarium. Would definitely Recommend to family and friends.
50,I was able to cancel my second night stay the night before without any problems. Very accommodating. It was an excellent experience for the first time staying at Mandalay Bay pleasant customer service neat and clean rooms lots of toiletries.
40,Fantastic Hotel Casino and Poo. The gaming floor provides great complementary alcohol for players. I ordered a blue moon and it even came with an orange slice all for free. The pool is amazing with a lot of space and it is basically a water park. This is probably the best hotel to take children with you since you can spend an entire day at the pool complex with a wave pool lazy river a sand beach and regular pools as well. It is far away from the strip so be prepared to walk if thats what you like or go with a rideshare. Be sure to sign up for the rewards to use at all MGM properties and occasionally receive complementary nights free play and resort credit.
10,First the front desk hung up on us FOUR times when we were trying to get our luggage at our room. Next morning there was no water in the shower and the front desk didn’t bother to send anyone to fix it. We were unable to take shower in this property which charges 44 dollars extra over the nightly fees as resort fee but cannot even provide a functioning shower in the room.
50,Amazing trip with my fiancé we gambledate drank and had fun exploring around the resort. We loved the restaurants and easy to find tram system that made it easy to adventure down the rest of the strip.
50,A great stay. Can’t complain about any facet of this stay. Staff was exceptional and was very helpful throughout the whole stay. Derek from bell desk was a huge help and concierge was huge help for my engagement.
50,We checked in after a terrible time at a different hotel and we’re immediately greeted with knowledge staff the rooms were dark and quiet and was in a great location. It ended up being cheaper than the first hotel and had a much better experience and sleep.
10,$70 for lo mein and fried rice. $12+ bottle water $50 a day to use the fridge $25 minimum tables nothing close by Walgreens was very far away but even if I bought stuff I could use the fridge without paying $50 a day.
50,I was greeted with a friendly smile and great service. Me and my guests had special medical needs that were able to be accommodated. The hotel room was super clean and the casino atmosphere was great.
10,Moldy rooms moldy bathroom terrible services over price. I was not impressed the bathroom was full of mold can’t change rooms then the door doesn’t close correctly no privacy. The rugs need to be change.
40,Trip to Vegas was a quick getaway - and Mandalay Bay was great. A few minor issues when checking in provided the staff opportunity to step up and make it right. Great restaurants and being the end of the strip made it easy to make sure nothing was missed. Bus services outside the door was convenient as well as tram.
50,All the staff provided exceptional service . Everything was amazing from check in to check out. We had a very specious room with beautiful views of the mountains and the strip!! Any time we needed anything the staff were there in minutes.
50,Love Mandalay Bay easy to get to the stadium for Pro Bowl easy check in and out good restaurant and shops. Super easy to get cabs to explore Vegas lots of other casinos nearby and walkable. Like staying in this casino.
50,Memorable. The people who work here make this the best place to stay in Vegas. The Concierge Desk people were caring the check in was a breeze. Every lounge and restaurant was a perfect experience. Excellence.
50,Beautiful hotel good restaurants & shopping. Table minimums were kind of high - otherwise really nice. Also a plus that Luxor Excalibur were connected Went straight from MB to the stadium from the casino area
30,I had a great weekend stay. Room was spacious and clean. It had a modern look. I liked all the restaurants we visited Ri Ra Citizens House of Blues. Great food and service. The reason for the 3 star instead of 5 is the unusable mini fridge. I would even consider buying the expensive bottled water if I could at least keep it cold! Instead it sits on the counter hot while I drink my hot water I got more at a more affordable price from the airport the night before. I saw in another review you can rent a usable fridge for $30? I would do that in a heartbeat. You should tell people when they check in and I bet you’d rent the heck out of those! I’ll be back because I love this hotel and casino and if I can get a fridge I’ll be a happy woman!
50,I celebrated my 40th birthday in my favorite city Las Vegas. I had a wonderful time. I stayed at the Mandalay Bay and this hotel is top notch. I had a room on the 60th floor with an amazing view of the strip. I’m a MGM Rewards member and trust me it’s totally worth it. The rooms are spacious and clean. I love the stand alone shower and the big jacuzzi tub. There’s lots of closet space. Victor at the front desk is very nice and helpful. I ordered room service off a late night menu and it didn’t take long at all for the food to arrive. I will definitely be back to this hotel and I recommend you stay. This is the only hotel with a beach like pool area is nice.
50,Everyone was super friendly. Made us feel like we were a “big deal” for staying there. Everyone went out of their way to be kind and make us feel welcome. Even the house keepers would tell us good morning!
50,It’s the Mandalay Bay. If you’ve stayed here you know. Great hotel great location great staff. It’s always a win when I stay here…. Except for the casino. I can’t seem to win. But that’s why it’s gambling. I will return!
20,The hotel and casino is beautiful well kept and in a great location. However they charge $14 for a cup of coffee in your room and the only options are to pay the $14 or stand in a horrible line at Starbucks. And it was $50 to use the refrigerator in the room or $30 to rent a mini fridge from the hotel. Also we used the app to check in and said we were there at 11am and had to check with the front desk 3 separate times to see if our room was ready which ended up being after the 3pm check in time. They were supposed to send my bags up when the room was ready which created additional confusion. Overall the hotel was nice but I wouldn't stay there again for the items mentioned above. It was simple things they could have included that ended up making the experience seemed cheapened which is unfortunate.
40,The room is clean but when checking the room we found that items for the mini bar were missing. So we made sure we double checked our bill to not get charged. The beds and pillows were very comfy. The dealers at the table were a delight. The staff at the clothing shops downstairs were also very helpful when shopping. Staff for shows were very polite and helpful. Only downside was the serving staff at every restaurant we visited in the hotel. The Seabreeze Rita and the only pizza joint. The staff all seemed to be put off and weren't very kind or helpful. We were not a large party and we were also not rude as half of us are also in the customer service and food service industry. While the food was good the staffs attitude was very off-putting and brought down the vibe. The only exception was the House of Blues. Both the staff and food were amazing all around.
50,Even though this resort is not located on the strip it's definitely worth staying. Beautiful laid back and relaxing vibe. It's not a busy as being on strip but still close enough to the strip. Not to mention they have a heated pool!!
30,Just another Vegas hotel. is not as advertised if you don't check your account statement you will be surprised of the extra expenses that may be incurred. There is nothing special about this hotel maybe if you get a good deal it's ok but paying a regular price is too much for the quality you get.
10,So many issues and it just doesn't seem like people really care anymore. Why can't we go back to when people cared? Housekeeping didn't care people don't answer the phone anymore ice machines broken the entire 5 days dirty glasses left in the room stuff in the drawers etc.
50,First time in Vegas with my wife. Hotel Room Was spotless.. plus they gave us a great view. Had no problems while our stay. Plus there casino and restaurants were popping all day and vives we’re great. Would recommend.. and price was fire!
50,Mandalay Bay is a Great Convention Hotel.  I am there every January for our Surfaces Convention.  Staff is always friendly.  Rooms are clean.  Room service would be nice - but you have good options to carry out or dine in.  Will be back again in January 2024!
30,We wanted to get away for couple day since not able to go in 3 years. Never stayed at Mandalay Bay before so checked it out. It was nice but didn’t realize it was on far end of strip. Weather wasn’t good so it affected out outside walking to a degree. The hotel room was ok. The view was poor because of our room location. The TV was set on SAP so there was a talking description of was was going on. The small coffee maker was part of the treat tray so if you wanted to make a cup of coffee you would be charged.
50,Loved my stay at Mandalay Bay. Beautiful resort with spacious rooms. Good restaurant selection and conference services. The atmosphere was great and the staff was friendly and easy check in mobile online.
30,I get that Vegas has become ridiculously rapacious in its quest to steal your wallet. And that likely Mandalay Bay is no different than the others. But no in room coffee or water a $39 “resort fee” to use the casino floor apparently? It’s petty and ungracious on the part of Big Casino.    Other than that a very nice place. Dellas was great for breakfast. The Irish Pub was terrific and great staff.
30,Loved the beds and room very cleanliness and enjoyed your casino will return weather you give me rewards or not as in comp rooms. The restaurant Kumi is my personal favorite. Wish there was a buffet again to enjoy that there. I received a tattoo at the starlite there and really enjoyed it.
40,"The rooms are beautiful view are great... enjoyed a 5-day vacation here ""will return"" the steak house food also staff are a true host of this location very fun and professional atmosphere. Thank you Scott for recommended this place."
30,The hotel was clean but super busy. I liked the check in check out process but when we went to check our bags which should be complimentary the porter told us a fee we should pay. From that point on we felt turn off.. it just seems like the cost of everything was over the top. I was just there last year and everything has gone up considerbly. I can't believe that a liter of Fugi water was a $28 charge in the room (I drank out of the tap at that point) and the coffee pods were $5 each... really? You couldn't even open the frig without fear of getting charged. I know things are expensive but these additional fees can start adding up. But clearly it didn't seem to bother the thousands of people staying at the hotel. The place was swarming with people. I like a much smaller hotel. Clearly Vegas is not my cup of tea.
50,Stayed here multiple times and been satisfied every time. Bell luggage were great and knowledgeable. Front desk was very accommodating and friendly. All staff was pleasant to deal with. Facility is a great location.
10,You are charged for EVERYTHING! Ate at one of their restaurants had left overs and notice when go to the room you can't even use the mini fridge they will charge you $50 if you do. There is no complimentary coffee in the room and then there was no water to take a shower or bath. It was just a dribble and barely warm. The restaurants were over priced and not very good for the price. I mean $40.00 for overcooked chicken and a few potato fingers REALLY? Will not stay there again.
50,Everything was excellent there is a lot of fun the bars live music I loved the service is very good the staff is very friendly the location is good and if you like to walk much better I was able to check in and check out without having to line up that's very good
50,Our overall experience was top notch. Staff was great the resort was great! Great variety of restaurants shops friendly casino staff. It was our anniversary we were acknowledged again overall great time
30,Overcharged for a complementary refrigerator they sent up dirty tub and shower I have been calling for two days in a row to try to get this issue resolved and no one answers the phone after being on hold for 15 minutes. I sent an email and got no response.
50,Nice rooms friendly services enjoyed the stay. Nice casino clean . Good coffee . Noisy neighbors but was moved by staff quickly . Would recommend to family and friends . Nice bars nice pool . Clean lobby
40,Big and Beautiful Hotel large convention center and great restaurants. Not much need to wander farther unless you are looking for shows being part of MGM they have a lot of sister hotels with all the attractions you might want to attend.
40,2 bedroom suite- Poor amenities for a suite compared to other suites. No coffee in suite-such a simple thing should be included. Robes and slippers had to be requested. Only 2 glasses were provided at the bar area.
50,Every time we stay here we are never disappointed. The bed is to die for can we buy one? Roomy room and sizable bathroom. Three adults and never felt cramped. Only issue we had is difficulty getting into casino from elevator hub. Seems to be the hang out area making it hard to get anywhere through it. Security needs to keep area clear for guests to move in and out.
20,Pricey rooms for what you get. There's a refrigerator but it's stocked with drinks that cost a small fortune. No microwave. Ice machine wasn't working. Super thin walls. You can hear everything including water running from the surrounding rooms when they shower or use the sink water. Lights flickered when the door shuts. Nice place just not worth what you pay.
30,Stayed for 2 nights. I arrived early and was able to check in early and they said they'd send me a text once room was ready. By 3pm still hadn't received a text and had to line up again at the front desk to follow up on my room. Other than that everything else was ok. Room was spacious clean. Bed was comfortable.
50,Wonderful experience at the Mandalay Bay. Customer service was top notch. Gabriel Culiat would definitely come back again. The hotel was clean and the room was large. We were greeted as we entered the hotel and at every restaurant we di ed at
40,We had a chance to do a quick one-night trip to Vegas and decided to give Mandalay Bay a try. Glad we did. The casino is huge there are plenty of good dining options and the rooms are clean and comfortable. Staff we interacted with were helpful friendly and efficient. The only downside was that we play video poker and they didn't have as many machines for that game as we have seen at other Las Vegas properties we have stayed or played at over the years. We went mid-week so it was not crowded at all.
50,This hotel is my favorite next to Bellagio . Great service  clean  convenient location. Either winter or summer we always happy to stay here . Highly recommend for friends  family and everyone. Thanks for your business
10,Even with payment with booking they could not come up with our room. NOT at 11 AM for which we prepaid for Early Arrival. NOT by 3 PM regular check in. So much for lunch and spa visit since we prepaid the pet fee for our small dog. Out of co trol and abusive with a smile
30,"Check in went great. Room was clean. Mini bar charges for items that weren't even touched was upsetting maintenance had to fix air coming into the room from outdoors with a roll of duct tape because window seal not maintained. Tv turnee on several times by itself. Elevator buttons sometimes not working even after key card scanned successfully. The added and undiscussed ""H charge"" to support the hotel industry on my restaurant bill ($30) that I was told couldn't be removed unless I go to the front desk and ask them to remove it. I donate with good tips and by paying very huh food prices such as $18 nuts in the mini bar I don't need to have an extra $30 charge slipped into by food bill to support the hotel industry the hotel industry got all kinds of government help and are doing just fine. This really upsets me because if I'm just one of several hundred people who done in the restaurants inside the hotel if this is happening to me it's happening to many others. Not very ethical in my opinion.  Besides that I've always loved coming here. Bellmen and other staff experiences were excellent. But if you're going to spend over a grand a night for a nice hotel room they should be better maintained and perhaps offer bath robes or slippers this isn't a Days Inn this is a luxury hotel suite and I would have expected more."
50,MGM properties and Casinos never fail to amaze enjoyed every aspect of the experience as always! Kumi Strip Steak and Lupo will never let your tastebuds down! Highly recommend MGM sports betting app as well!
40,If you are looking for a wild and crazy stay this ain't it. It was mostly older folks and families which was fine for me.    Pros: I didn't even see the front desk check in thru the MGM app you can even use it to open your door/use elevator(though much easier just getting a physical room key). Check out through the TV. Nothing really that crowded.  Ate at Border Grill everything surprisingly excellent. Had the enchiladas shrimp tacos skirt steak. Been to StripSteak Aureole in the past great but pricey. Room wifi was pleasantly ok for two people working in the room. There is a jack for an direct ethernet cable not sure it actually works.    Cons: Needs carpet updating rooms/hvac make strange noises nothing complementary including water/coffee.    Tips: You can get anything delivered to the hotel from Grubhub/Uber Eats etc. just meet them in the front entrance if you don't feel like paying Vegas prices. Remember your room key for parking entrance and exit. Take the complementary tram to Excalibur for a closer walk up the Strip. Make reservations for Thu-Sunday night meals.
10,Their overall service is terrible. Can never get a real person....always on hold at least 15 minutes. Internet was down. Brought my own coffee and had such a hassle to get a paper coffee cup since they don't provide that. After talking to 3 people I finally got a paper coffee cup. At check out they tried to charge me $14 for one paper coffee cup....ridiculous !
50,Wonderful stay at the Mandalay Bay. Came into town for the Michael Jackson show. It was so amazing. Check in was fast and easy. Room was clean and spacious. I would love to stay here again. Staff was wonderful also.
50,Great experience the facility was fresh and clean and staff was friendly and professional. I can highly recommend Mandalay Bay. Great location easy access from airport to hotel and hotel to airport very convenient to take in the entire strip.
40,I booked the executive king suite and in the picture it specifically shows the living room and bedroom separate by a wall. In room 5-134 it was not the case. There was a living room and bedroom but they were not separated by anything. I planned to entertain in the living room but who wants people to see their bedroom too. That picture is totally misleading.
30,Questionable cleanliness found an eyelash in bathroom & cigarette smoke floats through vents. Woke up in the middle of night sneezing & watery eyes due to cigarette smoke coming in through the vents. Overall expected better. Good room size & spacious. Fairly updated.
10,I will not be returning to the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino ever. This was my first time and it was not a good one. The shower door not opening to not heat in my room. I will not be returning!!! no way.
20,"Bathroom not cleaned from Blood stain on toilet 2 tiny trash cans for a four night stay and only two grimey chairs for sitting. Furniture is outdated and getting to the Food Court is a 30 minute walk almost forcing Guests to over-spend in Fancy Restaurants (The cafe closes at 2 PM) Was reserved for a ""Stay-Well"" room for my wife's Birthday 1/28 and charged $100 more but Nothing available at check-in and yet wanted payment for 4 Nights at increased rate. Beware of hidden charges!"
30,Mandalay has definitely aged - look for something that was recently built such as Aria Wynn cosmo etc. The hotel is definitely showing its age and is very loud if you have an airport view room. I stayed in both a king room and 2 bedroom suite and was disappointed in both. I would only stay there again if the price was significantly less then the hotels mentioned above.
40,We were not aware that the holding fee would be that much The room was nice and the hotel is located on the strip so it’s a great location The staff was really friendly to check me in was really easy
40,My husband and i stayed at Mandalay Bay to celebrate his birthday. Overall the trip was incredible. We had a wonderful stay at the hotel. My only issue was the front desk staff didn't seem to be too friendly when I checked in and the distance to the parking garage. Everything else was wonderful!
40,This trip was for my 43rd birthday. We stayed at Mandalay Bay. I have not stayed here since my 30th bday weekend so it’s been a bit. There has been a remodel & upgrade to the casino & I like it better than before. The casino is huge & has an open feel so you don’t feel as crammed in like some of the older Casinos. If you are early (check in is at 4) I recommend Hazel the lobby bar. Really good espresso martinis. We had side by side rooms on the 17th floor. They were really nice rooms. Having a large bathtub & a separate shower was great. There are coolers in your room but they are stocked & not for anything personal to put in. Sad face there. Also like everywhere in Vegas have your ID. We typically will charge everything to our rooms & that just helps your reward points. BUT like I said Have your id. You have to have your room key to get to your floor so best advice is have them print you a minimum of 2 but probably 3 keys. Our wives had to take the key to get ready & we ended having to get extra keys. Primrose helped us & she was great. Trying to make your own key on the machine with your app and QR is a super pain. BUT we figured out the digital key on our mlife app & that worked well our last day. Sea breeze cafe for breakfast ask for Ashley. Lucy was really polite at the host stand.
40,Arrived after midnight asked concierge is there somewhere to get some food. She said Subway or UberEats. Next night I found a whole food court with 24 hr place to eat & mini mart in the hotel. Never found a Subway in the hotel saw one 3 days later across the highway.
10,MGM Resorts must be owned by the same capitalists that own Spirit Airlines. Rates and Hotel May look pretty at first glance but read the fine print. Resort fees charged when there are no Resort amenities expensive parking $25 for a plastic container of Fiji water no day passes to the spa available to purchase or get charge for early or late checkout the list goes on. Don’t be fooled. And hotels are upset with the vacation rental industry taking their business?? For the over $300 I spent for one night of a standard room on a crappy floor with nothing but the view of a dirt roof and the rest of the building I could have easily rented an entire apartment with amenities like free parking and at least a jacuzzi- not to mention a kitchen living room etc.
50,A wonderful large and beautiful resort. We had a great time exploring the hotel and the hotels that connect with it. The food was delicious and our room was beautiful with an amazing view. The beds were our favorite most comfortable beds we’ve ever slept on. Mandalay is a must!
30,We've stayed at a lot of the hotels on the strip and Mandalay Bay is nice but it's in desperate need of some upgrades. The elevators weren't working (doors would close your number would light up but you wouldn't move) the elevator number pad was missing actual numbers (like someone physically removed that button) the key cards would only work when they felt like it. The rooms were decent but the hotel could use some help.
50,Enjoyed my stay at the Mandalay Bay this past weekend. The room was ready upon my arrival which made it so convenient. If you didn't want to. You wouldn't have to leave the property because they have everything! Fine dining gambling shows quick eats spas etc.
30,First off trying to find the parking lot for this casino is ridiculous.. The parking is to the rear of the casino and parked Delano parking...... For a beautiful casino outside the interior is just so so typical. Not a place for serious gamblers. Too many kids running around and not enough current slot machines.
40,Great hotel. Nice rooms. Excellent service. Good restaurants. Although they have an excellent show room with Santana the rest of the music around the casino was boring run of the mill. Great pool area.
50,The Mandalay Bay was a great find in Vegas. We were in town for a sports competition and found that its location offered easy access to other parts of Vegas. It never felt like we were drowning in the middle of the drunken Las Vegas Strip. The hotel was beautiful and the staff was lovely and really put forth a great effort to make our experience an incredible one.
40,Very nice facility. Best pool in Las Vegas! The exercise area is below standards and they charged you an extra $25 above the resort fee to go to the spa exercise area. Parking is expensive. Food prices are what you would expect. Very nice facility.
30,Mandalas Bay has been our Las Vegas resort each time we visit. We love the room sizes location and amenities. This visit we were not pleased with the overwhelming smoke smell rooms are becoming worn out and the fact that our neighbors were very noisy in the middle of the night
40,We've been to Vegas over 30xs since 1998. We try to stay different places and this was our first time at Mandalay Bay. It was great! We had a King Strip View room. We were on the 10th floor room 231. Great view of the strip. Only complaint would be the Mandalay sign was right at our level so it got pretty bright at night. So I would request a higher floor next time. Our bed and pillows were one of the best we've had at a hotel. The hotel is large but easy to navigate. We did mobile check in and got right in our room without any problems. Lots of dining options and fun bars at night. The grounds are really pretty and we will come back when all the pools are open. It is far from the center strip so you don't have access to as many hotels on foot. There is a tram that you can take to Luxor and Excalibur that gets you closer. All in all I would stay again.
50,We loved our stay at Madalay. Plenty to do room was beautiful and staff were great! Plenty of restaurants to choose from though our favorite was RiRa the Irish pub. The aquatic center is worth the tour as well!
50,This property is at the end of the strip which is great because you get the option to deal with the crazy busy strip and just stay at your property. Loved the free tram between Mandalay Luxor and Excalibur.
40,Lovely hotel in a quiet location. We had a two bedroom suite on the 22nd floor and it was comfortable and clean. The only fault I can find is that there wasn’t a fridge only a mini bar that you couldn’t store your own drinks etc in. As it was winter there’s was only one pool open but it was heated and pleasant with bar service Thursday to Sunday. They could have opened the bar mid week thoughas there were enough people using the pool to make it worthwhile. All in all a really pleasant stay and I would stay here again.
50,This hotel is very clean. It is updated and new. It doesn't have the stale smoke smell that the other casinos had. It is a little noisy since it is very close to the airport. There are a nice group of restaurants but they need to stay open later. There is a tram that runs between a few of the hotels. It would be nice if it ran the whole strip.
10,Check in took hours then they attempted to downgrade my room that I booked over a month in advance.  Casino service was horrible no matter if you tipped $5 or $10.  Room was dirty  Room was hot  Bathroom was very dark.
10,Booked a King bed for my and my girlfriend they ended up giving me a 2 queen bed asked for streetview end up with poolview.  the VIP personnel was rude and wasn't trying to help with anything.  wished i can book a different hotel upon arrival
50,Wonderful introduction to Vegas we were all very pleased with the hotel and staff. We loved all the amenities including the pool staff were friendly and respectful of our needs. We would very much enjoy coming again soon. Thank You 🙏
20,Mandalay Bay left a lot to be desired. There is better hotels out there that would have been a lot better. The app sucked and kept locking us out of our account and wouldn’t even work on the elevators. Parking is 18 a night pretty ridiculous since you’re paying resort fees on top of that. No fridge since theirs is full of their items to buy. If you remove the overpriced items you’ll have to pay for it. A small fridge should be a given at any hotel.
50,We had an amazing experience this last weekend. The online check in was very efficient and worked well. The VIP transportation experience from the airport was flawless. From texting his location to the nice limo waiting right out front....... When we entered the lobby of the resort there was no line so we'd thought we'd ask about the availability of an upgraded room. Sure Enough Sebastian was right on it. There was an additional charge but well worth it. We were in room 30-201 with nice strip views. Room was well appointed  maybe showing his age a little but priced for the quality of our stay. Good beds and pillows... After checking out I had a question about a credit on my bill and Arianna in guest services was very accommodating and Got it cleaned right up. For south of strip lodging and entertainment this is the place for us.
50,Everything was amazing! Amazing room casino was very clean room was clean bed was so comfortable staff was very nice. Aquarium was amazing easy walk way to the tram! Elevators were fast Staying here again soon
50,What sticks out about this hotel is the people that work there. Every stay the employees have gone out of their way. They are uber nice very knowledgeable! Check in was smooth. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The gym is very well equipped. Overall for me it was wonderful
40,Great hotel nice rooms..location is far from center strip. Thing I have the most trouble with is valet is not a reduced price for handicap individuals. Parking lots are typically farther than comfortable and valet is our option but we had to pay $40 per night to valet (and we were told $30 but our receipt says $40). Also if you want water pressure in the shower you do that with not hot water… hot water was just a trickle.
50,The front desk staff was very helpful and willing to accommodate my needs. I called for room service and the time expectancy exceeded my expectation from the speedy delivery of my food that was hot and ready to eat.
50,Very nice with access to everything. The check in lady I wish I knew her name was a Japanese woman gave the 100 percent top level service that set my trip off right. Get the MGM parking pass for 18 it gives you access to all the parking lots
50,Yearly weekend stay this time in November.  Stays here before and love the outdoor area it was a bit cold now! But have best beach on strip. Spacious rooms with god bathroom. Lot of places to eat and drink. Will be back  preferably during pool season.
50,excellent service clean room Friendly staff. this is our second stay exceeded what we expected. Plenty of restaurant to choose accessible to another hotel thru the tram. Will always come back. highly recommended.
30,When we got there our room was n/a they wanted to give us queen beds and if we wanted the king they were going to charge extra. Some of the staff at the casino area were very rude. The baggage lost my bag
50,this is our second time to stay at mandalay bay and as expected it was so nice all the staff were nice and friendly they show their interest to accommodate the guest and make them feel comfortable definitely will go back again highly recommended to stay.
10,I took my wife to the Mandalay Bay for her birthday there was water leakage on our bathroom ceiling it ruined her makeup and all they could do was switches to a worst room that was loud My wife had no sleep when we left the bellboys I don't know if they lost our luggage but our shuttle was waiting for over half an hour they kept saying the shuttle was a no-show so they lied The shuttle left us because he had other pickups and we were holding him back so we had to pay for a cab to get back to the airport so if anything you owe me money and I want a full refund for my stay All the second manager did was give us credit for two resort fees which I don't think we should have paid not even one I am going to take this to a higher up and let him know that he needs an upkeep on the hotel rooms and on some of his managers that he has in the front desk that have cereal customer service experience The manager did not even apologize for all the mishaps The only one that cared was her manager that waved two days of the resort fees but after the shuttle I should not have to pay for anything if anything you all my wife and I have pictures if you need to see them Will never ever stay at this place again nor will I ever recommend it not even to my worst enemy and this is being generous
50,Super clean and nice staff. When I needed to extend my stay it took 5 mins and he gave me a great rate. I needed more towels it was no problem. Excellent hotel.Housekeepers were very nice and said hello. Not many cocktail waitresses but it was midweek. Casino was super clean also.
50,We really enjoyed our stay at Mandalay Bay! We were able to check in digitally but our digital key wasn't working. Not a problem tho we were quickly shown to a kiosk and made our own keys. The room was beautiful clean and comfortable. The layout of the bathroom was perfect and the tub was fantastic after a fun night in Vegas. Thank you Mandalay Bay!
40,Enjoyed our stay at Mandalay Bay hotel! clean rooms service was great - Casino clean and spacious. We never ate at any of the restaurants in there but can say we had some drinks and ya expensive...but its a casino. Parking was always available and the hotel was a busy spot (we were there during CES). On site show was great (Cirque - MJ). Near enough to the strip can take monorail more than half way there - short walk. We've stayed at a few places and this is so far our fav.
30,The bathroom was dirty when we got up to the hotel. When we told the customer service rep she told us “these things happen and I’ll let the housekeeping supervisor know.” She honestly could’ve cared less. Other than that the hotel is nice but watch out. Don’t use the fridge or touch anything off of the concession platter. You’ll be charged. I’m glad hubby asked before we went up to our room.
50,Great experience  room was excellent and bigger than most rooms I have stay in Las Vegas. Also with the online check in its a breeze to check in and you get the keys on your phone all in all great experience
10,Checked in and immediately we had a front desk clerk whom was very rude with attitude. We ended up having to downgrade our room after we had paid for an upgrade because of front desk clerk. Finally got to room and room was dirty and tv did not work. Waited 4 hours to get resolved after midnight. Went to front desk three times and spoke to three different clerks including a manager and none were friendly. They just said there is nothing they can do to help resolve issue quick I also suggested a room change and they wouldn't even do that. First and last time staying at Mandalay Bay.
20,The bed was very lumpy and uncomfortable… pillows were not comfortable. Slot machines were very tight … realizing this is Vegas .. even the food was pricey and not the best value… seems the focus is to get every dime possible and not much to enhance the experience
40,Nice less busy part of strip with plenty options to choose from in regards to restaurants bars coffee breakfast. Fun bands at night and tram accessible. Only small negative is bed is a little firm for our taste.
50,The hotel during the week wasn’t too busy. No smoking horse betting area was great. Choice of eateries and being linked to the Delano which sadly I didn’t discover at all as I only saw it on the sign on the last day. Have to go back to swim there next time    noise & glitz by popping down to the four seasons.
50,Rooms were clean the casino was extremely nice. They even had a train that take u closer to the strip...I didn't have any issues at all the bar was even open all night..not to forget all the nice restaurants.
30,Hotel needs update. Used to be the place to be now the carpet rooms need a refresh. Location is too far to have outdated hotel. Ironically a lot of prostitution in the casino after hours. Not what it used to be.
40,went to las vegas and stayed at Mandalay Bay. Was a very good experience. Room was clean hallways and elevators were clean. the room seems dated but i did not spend much time there other than sleeping. would definitely stay there again
40,The resort is great clean and quality resort. Friendly staff and quieter than central resorts because if it's location. People say great family location but it depends upon if you want to see the free type Vegas attractions like Bellagio waterfalls Mirage volcano Ceasars statues etc. These are great things for families but you are a long way from them so you'll spend a lot of time on trams walking or Ubers. You can avoid this by staying in a more central location.
30,Not a bad place to stay however not great. Paid resort fees but no resort amenities available. Room had stains in the floor. Asked for and paid for what should have been a upgraded room however the roof didn’t feel like a upgrade.
10,Rude staff slow checkin terrible customer service. Terrible value for money and off strip. House keeping did not clean the room. Customer service on bad experience was awful - did not care - tried to rush you off the phone with terrible unfair solutions. Overpriced food and terrible location basically felt off strip. Suggest you stay center strip and with a better hotel - don’t let the 4.5 stars fool you. This place is an unfair money grab.
50,First time staying at the a Mandalay Bay. There are a lot of fun things to do like visit the aquarium or see a show. The food court was small but it was a good resource when if you didn’t want to eat in a restaurant. I really liked Cocolini! The gelato was so good.
50,Very nice and clean hotel. Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms were quiet and beds were comfortable. Great view of the strip. Many different dining options with plenty of bars and coffee shops. Elevators worked well and fast.
20,Booked this trip in advance for my Birthday and thought it was a good deal at the time. I was mistaken. I was surprised to find out that there is a $400 hold on your account when you check-in. You can get free coffee at a cheap motel but coffee here will cost extra as nothing is free except for ice; you cannot even use the refrigerator without paying a price. If you are looking for something ridiculously overpriced for the actual value and service/amenities included then you have found the right place to book your stay.
50,The staff at Mandalay Bay was exceptional. They were the most pleasant staff we have encountered. Love that the casino is open and spacious and does not have the machines stacked on top of each other.
40,This would be one of the best hotels on the strip if it was closer to the action. That being said the tram from excalibur was really quick and it was really a big deal. The rooms and hotel facilities are amazing. I loved the slower pace and not feeling crowded.
40,Met up with 12 sorority sisters in Vegas for a reunion. Our 2 bedroom suite was a perfect meeting place for everyone even though most were staying in other rooms and hotels. Casino was pretty quiet though. Didn't realize that the shooting happened at this hotel a few years ago.
50,Family Trip Daughters Brithday Had a great time. Rooms were clean and staff was very friendly. Great customer service. Restaurant were also good. Highly recommended for everyone who wants to have a good time
50,The room was lovely and spacious. The bed was very comfortable which you don’t always find. The bathroom was large with a separate soaking tub. The staff were all friendly and helpful. Ordered room service and it was the best cheeseburger I ever had. Breakfast at the Seabreeze Cafe was wonderful. The brisket at House of Blues was phenomenal. Loved staying here.
40,Don’t touch the snacks unless you intend to buy them. Simply lifting them up means you have purchased them! Hope they change this odd and trap like feeling scheme. Otherwise everything was completely top notch.
50,Perfect MGM property to stay for business trips plenty of restaurants and shops. Restaurants that are located on business food is great. Bar lounges good for quick relaxation and unwind. Would stay here for vacation purposes.
40,Always like staying at the Mandalay Bay but although our room was clean it was super drafty near the windows. Had to crank up the heat to make it comfortable. Needed an ADA compliant room received a Hearing impaired room with no ADA.
10,It was worse experience at this resort   manager is very rude had multiple bad experience with management if i am going to write here there is not enough characters fit in this little box  Feel cheated
50,We really enjoyed our stay! Rooms were comfortable and clean. The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful at all times. Would most definitely book here again. The restaurants are over-priced and the food was okay.
50,We really enjoyed our stay at the Mandalay Bay. Such a beautiful and well kept resort. The rooms are huge and the bathtub at the bathroom is a huge plus. Make sure to get a Strip view you won't regret it. Since the hotel is at the south end be prepared to walk a bit more than other properties but is totally worth. Use the complementary tram and the inside walkways to walk to the Excalibur and escape the heat or cold depending the season you travel.
40,The hotel is exactly what you expect when you travel to Vegas: Accommodating clean modern exciting yet the rooms are really nice! The shopping and sights were really great for folks of all ages too!
10,Staff was rude at check in. Inquired about an upgrade and they scoffed. I thought it was one per year based on availability. I checked. There was availability. That's fine I figure the room should be nice anyways. After laughing at me a bit more they give me my key and I'm on my way. Room was a connecting room for a suite in which the other party was extreamly loud waking us up every night. Front desk didn't answer. Room service didn't answer. Then there was the pipes. The pipes kept gurgling. It was loud. The maid actually entered our room despite the do not disturb being on without even knocking no apologies. The players club decided to close when I was next in line. They saw me 3 girls all looked at me and laughed  then walked away. Asked why my points weren't working and she just prints a card and says I'm good. Well it wasn't of course. Apparently no one could help at all. We were very much ready to leave. Not the experience in used to at a MGM property in Vegas. Think I'll stick with the bellagio or cosmo.
50,My room was spacious and comfortable. Food options were good. Casino floor was spacious and clean. I enjoyed the less than normal amount of small children. I will definitely go back again and bring my wife this time.
50,Upon arriving my wife and myself were already happy for picking the hotel to stay at without the kids for the first since getting married. Checking in was easy and the rooms were really nice. Great variety of restaurants. We didn't get a chance to get in the pool since it was freezing but will definitely try out next time.
50,Will definitely come back again Haven't stayed at this hotel before nice that we were able to use our rewards at other places and was close to everything very clean and comfortable didn't spend slot of time in our room.
50,My wife and I were just here for 5 days / 4 nights. The staff were amazing our room was spacious and clean and we had fun playing in the casino. The tram that takes you up to the North end of Excalibur was also very handy when we wanted T I bead further up the Strip.
10,Nothing went well from start to finish. Limo driver included with the VIP pickup was not where I was directed and had wrong name on sign. Was not told there was a special check in line for VIP and waited in regular line room was dirty with black specks all over bedding on the edges etc. was offered a new room they checked us out before our departure date I had to prove my check out date was there error. UGH It was just a mess.
50,From arrival to departure we enjoyed Mandalay Bay. Very clean property and the staff was friendly and helpful. Good dining options and plenty of gambling opportunities. Looking forward to returning soon
50,We always have a great time when visiting Mandalay Bay. So much to do and see. The food places were great the slots were good to us and the shark reef was fun to see. We plan on visiting soon again once the pool area is open. Great memories.
50,Great hotel great value great staff. Rooms were clean. Casino far better than Luxor or Excalibur which are nearby. Food options were great as well with a wide variety. Casino dealers where very personable and helpful.
40,Checking in was a breeze via the MGM app and we didn't even need to stand in line for keys. The room was assigned via the app and your smartphone acts as a key to enter the room. I loved this! I stayed in a two bedroom king suite that had a view of the big Mandalay sign with its very bright LED display to the left and the airport on my right. Neither view was breathtaking. Each bedroom had a separate bathroom with very spacious bathtubs as well as separate showers along with in-mirror televisions (not the best quality) and bedrooms were connected by a common living area that seemed more like two separate sitting areas (each area had it's own TV). The furniture in the living area was gaudy to put it nicely and not overly comfortable. The beds and pillows were comfortable although I could tell that at least one mattress was needing replacement because I kept sliding off near the edge as I slept. The sheets and towels were clean and fresh and the daily housekeeping service was outstanding.    This is a huge property so be prepared to walk and walk....and walk. I love that it's connected to the Luxor and Excalibur with many shops in between. The gaming floor is spacious and lively in the evening. The House of Blues is located on site and as of this writing had Santana playing. The staff were professional but I can't say they were all too friendly. Prices are what you'd expect for a Strip hotel. Scooters can be rented from a kiosk in the hotel lobby which is convenient for the disabled or those who have a difficult time walking long distances.    I never had a problem getting on any of the slot machines nor was there ever a really long line at the players club or the cage cashier. Plenty of ticket redemption kiosks throughout. The restaurants were so-so and meals for two routinely cost us $50-$60 a meal.    Don't forget that this property is one that has a lot of big conventions so expect a huge flood of people at Starbucks or congregating around the hotel elevators in the morning and afternoon.
50,We've been back twice the last few weeks and lived each stay. The rooms are excellent we even upgraded the 2nd trip. We really enjoy the bars in the casino and the shoppes and restaurants are all great.
30,I have never stayed at a resort where free coffee was not available in the room or in the lobby. Also I was not able to use the refrigerator because it was filled with items they wanted to sell you. If I wanted a refrigerator they would of charged me.
50,Staying in Vegas is always a hard decision but with Mandalay Bay you will never go wrong! What a lovely property and quiet away from the noise on the strip and so close to the airport. But it’s the people and staff that make Mandalay Bay so great. The rooms are incredibly comfortable and the bathrooms are lovely!
30,"Usually one of my favorite places to stay on the Strip this trip to Mandalay Bay was awful. The rooms and beds were very good as always but the rest of the trip was littered with bad experiences.  1. My rental car was damaged by the valets at MB. Came in on Sunday to valet with a fully working driver's side rearview mirror. When I got the car back on Monday morning the mirror did not work and the outside portion of it was chipped. Causing me massive headache now with the rental car company we used.  2. Went to the Spa at Delano on Monday afternoon and was turned away from a day pass because ""all the lockers were taken"". This was four hours before the spa closed. The attendant at the desk was incredibly rude and pretty much didn't want to work so she sent us away. Whoever was in the locker room area that told her there were no more lockers and then didn't realize we heard him say there were available lockers is a jerk.  3. At Eye Candy on Monday night the bartender working complete ignored our party for 10 minutes while we were standing at the bar. He served numerous other people that arrived at the bar while we were standing there but didn't serve us. When he finally did come over and when we asked him why he didn't come over to us before he served the other people he told us verbatim ""f*** off"". Being a bit mad ourselves we gave him a few colorful metaphors back before leaving the bar. We even went to security and were met with indifference.    Horrendous experience this time around."
50,Stayed at Mandalay Bay for Shot Show 2023 and had a get experience. Everything from check in to check out was amazing.    Staff was helpful and friendly  Security was professional and on point to handle problems before they became an issue for visitors.
50,This was a short stop over on the way back from skiing in Utah. I enjoyed one restful wonderful night. I can highly recommend Mandalay Bay for quality of this accommodations and the excellent service provided by it’s personnel.
50,The stay was very much too short had a cheerleading competition to be at and wasnt able to enjoy many of the amenities I wanted to. Convenient using rewards app for check in n out. Able to view all rewards and used many
50,Spent the first 3 days of a 7 day trip here. Exceptionally clean room. Loved the double sinks and tub. Also loved the double closet! Was a bit bummed some conventions took over the Minus 5 & Prohibition Bare but there was still plenty to do. Be sure to have dinner at Libertine Social!
10,"BELLHOPS STEAL. I had to leave my bag with the bellhops for a couple hours before leaving for the airport. When I got home I discovered $1000 cash missing from my bag. This was 2 months ago. I immediately called their security they said they would ""conduct an investigation and call me back."" They never called back I have called them multiple times since and they keep transferring me to a number that nobody answers nor responds to voicemail. Nothing more reprehensible than your employees stealing from customers and just trying to sweep it under the rug."
50,Stayed at this fabulous hotel for 3 nights. My experience was absolutely amazing. The hotel room had everything that is expected from a high-rated hotel. Big washroom hair dryer and iron. It is right next to the airport it will take 5-8mins to reach. There's usually a long waiting line at the reception. The receptionist was so kind to us and gave us free car parking for 3 days. The interior decoration was very beautiful as we went there on Christman. They have free room service every day so it helps to keep the room clean. Staffs around the hotels are very helpful. There are a lot of activities and places to visit inside the hotel. You can spend 1 day roaming around in the hotel. The casino is huge and always crowded. There are shuttles from Mandalay bay to Luxor and other places which is very helpful. Few restaurants are there at the hotel food for breakfast. We loved our stay at the hotel as it is all that is expected from a vegas hotel. Although the location of the hotel is a little outside the city. This place is recommended for a stay and in accordance with the price it gives good facilities. There is a beach which is beautiful but couldn't go as it was winter. The hotel is always crowded with guests coming and going.
50,Had an amazing stay restaurants were amazing and the employees very polite. Location was great since it’s at the beginning of the strip. Only small inconvenience was the weed smoke coming in through the connecting room doors.
50,When I’m in Vegas I always stay here. The staff is great. The hotel is beautiful. I love the location. The restaurants are good as well. My family can always find something to do and eat. We all absolutely love this hotel.
30,It’s a descent place but honestly for the same price there was a couple of options I wish I would have taken but now I know for the next time. Overall it was a good experience can’t really complain about anything except there was this weird noise in my room bathroom sounded like the water kept trying to rise. Don’t know if I’ll be staying here again.
50,It was a all around great experience will definitely be coming back. Everyone was so nice and everything was in a great location if you haven’t you must book at this hotel it’s the best clean professional and nice.
30,Average hotel they try to nickel and dime you for everything which is not convenient. The location sucks in terms of strip placement and the hotel is prob the least beautiful inside but keep in mind what they are up against. I thought the hotel would cater to us more. Prob not the best deal around this time of year but we enjoyed our stay.
50,Good hotel for familly events . You gonna like it and want to come again here .my family do a very happy spring festival here .. offers us late check out and 1400 dollar comp for dinning . Next holiday i goona come again !
30,Is ok hotel for family trip. Can be much better. Somewhat at far end of strip. Was windy and cold weekend so did not use the swim area. Not much free activity for kids.. hard to shield kids from casino …
50,The trip was great and the hotel was very comfortable. Parking was easy and the front desk added it to the bill for easy use. I enjoyed the wide variety of restaurant choices and had Chinese food for dinner.
50,Great clean hotel and rooms. Very easy to get around. It's at the end of the strip but easy access for Uber so no issue really. Great staff all around and am easy quick check-in process. So much to do at one casino/hotel!
50,I took my son and granddaughter. for their first time and we had a blast. Not enough time to take it all in. the kids explored the hotel one night and they came in around 6 am slept for 2 hours and were back at it.
40,Not good if you arr going with family. No fun no shows for family n kids. No indoor swimming pool. They are charging 130$ per day resort fees but has nothing. The rooms are pretty big but no refrigrator or microwave very inconvinient. It is far from strip. The main entrance has nobody to guide or help for checkin u will be lost.  The service girls in casino dont bring ur drinks in fact you can see them hardly. So dont expect free drinks.  A lot of smell in casino for weed and cigerates. Casino is very small as compare to other casinos.
40,I would have preferred to stay during a warmer drier part of the year so as to enjoy the pools and other amenities. Given it's location at one end of the strip it was pleasantly less packed than many of the other hotels. The rooms were very nice and the parking was much easier to access than the MGM Grand.
40,The Hotel was in a great location and has lots of show and places to eat. You can connect to other hotel without going outside. They have train service that will take you further down the strip. This is the first time staying at the Mandalay and it was Great. The only downside was all room service for washcloth.
50,Great hotel. Clean and nice rooms. I stayed at nearly every property on the strip Mandalay is on my top 3. The restaurant choices are great and i personally love the location. Keep up the great job as always
50,This was my fourth trip to Vegas. I've stayed at Wynn Encore Bellagio and Mandalay Bay. The ambiance the staff the food the service all of it was just amazing. There are many amenities within this hotel; including connectors to Luxor and Excalibur! I would highly recommend! 10/10
40,Check in was speedy and friendly. Room was great. Did not receive a full set of towels in the room. Requested them and they did not deliver to my room. Received messaged that my do not disturb sign was on the door but it was on my desk! Called again arrived after 7 when original request was at 2. Left a gambling ticket on the desk to take down in the evening housekeeping took it. A/c shuts down even when it does not reach set temperature. Toilet ran all the time unless you did a second flush. Room details seem to be falling apart.
10,What a horrible experience! First time at Mandalay bay and will never go back. there is way more to this story but have shortened it for ease of reading.  Husband and I splashed out and booked a suite for 1 night at over $1000 as it was a very special occasion.  We were absolutely appalled at how we were treated at reception.  After waiting for hours it was going on 430pm and the room still was not ready so we went to reception desk to check why.  We were berated and spoken to like little children by an uppity self important woman that just because check in time was 3pm does not mean we will get it that time. Barked at that you will have to wait as we had an actual VIP in the suite last night and they checked out late and the carpet needs to be shampooed windows cleaned etc. so we assumed they had a party or something but that’s not our fault is it!  We really were made to feel like we were looked down at and unimportant.  I’m fairly sure we are also a customer and our money is worth just as much as someone else’s VIP or not!!!  But we had no choice but to wait until it was ready so we did.  By the time we got to the room we had had our time cut short due by a few hours due to no fault of our own but it is what it is I guess.    On entering the room we were greeted with an overwhelming stench of cleaning product which was strong enough to give a headache and ended up with wet socks from the wet carpet. this room should not have been re hired until it was worthy of the price tag!  Felt like we got off lightly however when we overheard the poor couple next to us at reception got down graded on their special occasion that was booked months in advance and checked in a day earlier.  They must have resold the room and they got offered the downgraded room and a $50 credit! So didn’t really get any benefit from the inconvenience just told too bad this is what’s happening.  So I guess if you are not a VIP you get the short end of the stick at Mandalay bay!  What a joke this place is. Will never go back taking my money elsewhere. Sad to say that I have been treated better at other hotels even when not paying much or have comp nights!
50,We have a great experience everyone are very kind and professionals. I like seeing everyone smiles all the time. Our room is clean and neat. We will be coming back for more get away  we definitely stay again at mandalay bay.
50,I will try this hotel again I just want to be treated bett then what I was treated I will recommend this hotel to people I just hope it was just that one time for the bad service I received I enjoy the 64 floor
50,The staff from the time you check in until you check out are friendly accommodating professional and make you feel they really mean it when they say “let us know if there is anything we can do for you”
40,Mandalay Bay is a great hotel but in my opinion is just too far from the heart of the Strip. As far as the accommodations the bed was super comfortable. My bathroom could have been cleaner but I clean all hotel rooms as soon as I arrive. It would be great if guests could use the refrigerator in the rooms.
50,Quiet friendly clean and beautiful rooms! Easy check in and check out. Like being farther down the strip rather than in the middle of crowded sidewalks. Nice to have a free tram to Excalibur. Nice pool hot tub and cardio room.
50,Clean hotel friendly staff modern looks. The hotel was big easy to get around In. Loved the tram system and the ability to get over to the other casinos. Decorated lovely for the new year. Overall satisfied
50,Main reason I enjoy Mandalay Bay is because it's slightly outside the main area of the strip and a little more quiet than other main hotels along the strip. The hotel is nice clean casino is good. Tons of restaurants reptile aquarium michelob arena. Minus 5 ice bar is also pretty neat as well as the prohibition bar.
50,Wonderful and clean hotel. Always a great time when staying here. Normally go during the summer to experience the pool but this time was a little bit cold. Love mandalay bay and will always stay here while I visit vegas
40,We are used to staying on center part of strip however we were not disappointed in Mandalay Bay. (With the exceptional $10 can of soda in the minibar)! Ridiculous. Overall rooms were quiet and we had a great time
50,My start at Mandalay Bay was exceptional since I had a bad experience with another hotel employee going through my bag left in room. I had to schedule a last minute stay because of this and the staff were exceptional.
40,Stayed here due to a soccer tournament. Very clean room nice tub and detached shower. Nice layout of the room. Left room usually in the afternoon and would still come back to room service being done. Not far from eateries or tournament.
50,There’s no other place in would want to go food with the restaurants were a good choice loved the view at my room casino was paying out won down at the casino love that I didn’t need to go any where everything was there
40,i used my rewards and got an excellent room... had a good experienced coming back for second time @ mandalay hotel with my husband and meet with my friends and collegue on same hotel only thing was claiming rewards has long line and seems staff was run out of energy very bland talking did not realize people claim free stuff but in reality people also spend so much cash and lose with gambling... but its really excellent stay and we are going back again..
50,Friendly staff clean rooms and plenty to do at the hotel. Easy tram ride away to other hotels and attractions. Every restaurant was amazing. Plenty of shopping and even a few pleasant surprises that you only find after exploring.
10,They don’t track sports book wagers for rating or comps. NEVER been anywhere that didn’t track wagers. Asked for casino host 3-4 times was never contacted. Will never stay there again! Nobody cared or even tried to help me.
40,Room was quiet. Staff  Friendly. Bed super comfortable. No free coffee in room and no wash cloths. I got over 25000 steps a day in walking the strip and half of that is due to where Mandalay Bat is located…it’s at the very end of the southern tip of the strip.
50,This was my first time at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino but it won't be my last. It close to other resorts and their is much to do inside the resort. There are quite a few excellent restaurants to try I highly recommend Lopo's. There are the stores if you are looking to do some high-in shopping.
50,Excellent mid-tier resort casino despite no access to the amazing pool complex (due to time of the year of our visit). I mention the pool area because many consider it to be a main draw for the hotel. Our room a Skyview suite was a little bit dated but extremely clean and comfortable. It was a mostly quiet experience in the room although the ventilation/heat system made a noticeable amount of white noise as it kept the temperature at a comfortable level during the relatively cool January days and evenings. We ate at both the Sea Breeze and Noodle restaurants which were both had good food but like everything on the Strip were overpriced for the offerings. The casino play was fun and all of the common areas were clean unlike my last few experiences at Park MGM which I love but it always seems a bit dirty from weird smells in the elevators to trash littered hallways that lead to the rooms. Mandalay Bay was very clean and fresh in comparison. The valet service seemed extremely backed up so we chose to use the service at the Delano garage entrance which was much faster. Overall we had a great experience and I plan to stay again if the prices are agreeable during our next vacation. Hopefully it will be during the warm months so that we can use the wonderful pool area.
40,Its what you can expect in a Vegas trip but did not stand out. Not my favorite but not a bad place Id say give it a visit i try to attend  a stay at each location at least once. Personal Likeness Rank Compared: lessthen<Aria/Vdara; greaterthen>Excalibur/NY-NY ; lessthen or equal<'=Mirage..
50,Very nice place to stay. Easy to walk the strip from there - lots of things to do and to see!! The tram makes getting to the strip a little easier! Can easily walk to the famous Las Vegas sign going the other way as well!!
30,There was not a lot to do in the hotel in offseason. It’s a “beach/pool” resort. I enjoy the wow of seeing the gardens and shops at the other hotels that’s not a thing for MB in the off-season.  We were continually disappointed with places closing at odd times.  The best thing was the live band at night in the open area but we couldn’t figure out when they would be there. They start and end at different times every night. We planned to go watch and dance the next night after seeing them and showed up to a dead venue. The quick togo citizens restaurant was never open when we wanted to grab something.  It’s hard on a vacation weekend to keep track of the randomness in their activity/open schedule.  It’s probably great for families in the warm months.
50,Mandalay Bay is on the southern end of the strip and helps in planning a nice walk for however long you can last. Eateries are of an upscale level and everything else below that but they close early so eat early. Lol
20,MB is at the far south end not really near anything.  The mini-fridge is NOT for personal use and no microwave.  The mini-bar takes up valuable countertop room and can't be touched. Self park never worked.
50,Very nice. Very clean. No negatives and all positive trip. I would highly recommend this property for any Vegas trip. Casino was clean as were the rooms. Very closer to the airport for quick and easy pick up.
40,I am definitely heading back to Mandalay Bay in the near future I can't wait to take my wife on a weekend trip. I've stayed at pretty much all the casinos on the strip and Mandalay Bay has become one of my favorites.
50,Great staff customer service friendly and efficient fun bars great casino floor clean and organized the property is stunning! Also recommend the strip view resort room absolutely beautiful! I can say enough about this place. Mandalay Bay for life ❤️
50,We have been coming to Mandalay Bay for 15 years every year at least once a year. We were married there as well. Love the restaurants rooms and service. Easy to rideshare down the strip or take tram
50,Great place for a getaway! We arrived on a Saturday had a quick check in. The room was clean and well maintained. The casino staff was friendly and helpful. We ate at three restaurants on the property and all were excellent.
20,Safe wouldn’t work.. they told us to wait because we had to be there when they fixed it. 2 hours later no one showed up. If I wanted to stay in my room all day I woulda stayed home.I could go on about The REWARD Program but I’ll simplify it.. spent close to 27k between my brother and I on gambling. REWARDS = 30$ between the 2 of us.. what a joke.
50,The room and bathroom was amazing. Everything was clean and upto standard. The check in and check out process was the easiest.  The only problem was that there was a screeching noise all night which was troublesome. It could be because my room was facing the airport.
50,Always a great experience from the staff friendliness casino and amenities! Mandalay Bay has a lot to offer and don’t be discouraged that it is at the end of the strip-it’s quiet and a short walk or tram to everything else!
20,Stay clear of Mandalay Bay they promise the world but still charge you for everything. Didn’t have this issue at Luxor. Resort credit was charged to my card with no explanation. Can’t even use the room refrigerator without being charged.
10,two times experience with the faucet problem this time I even don't want to complain about it with the price it is totally not worth it. if you touch the food of snack bar then you have to pay for it what kind of stupid idea and surely will get more bad experiences than the goods they sold
50,Loved vacation wished hot tub would have been open in the evenings during our January stay. Don't touch the water in the room sensory activated at 24 a bottle hotel does a great job to make sure you know this. Also crazy expensive if you want to use coffee maker in the room.    Very close to strip take free tram to Excalibur then walk to strip. Ideal if you want a very nice hotel with great amenities and don't need to be in the center of the strip
40,Mandalay Bay is a huge resort with over 3200 rooms. The design of the hotel has elevators in the center of the building with 3 hallways on each floor that fan out from the elevators. With 35 rooms in each hallway you could have a long walk from the elevators to the room if your room number is over 25. We never had a long wait for an elevator as there were 8 of them.  We had the strip view which is nothing special with the hotel being at the end of the strip. The standard rooms are large with two separate closets and a separate tub and shower.  The free tram to Excalibur and Luxor saves some walking to New York and MGM Grand. The view from The Foundation Room on the 63rd floor is awesome and you should check it out. There is a special elevator that you need to take up. You will be asked if you have a reservation at the restaurant but you can tell them you are just headed to the bar for a drink to get on the elevator that goes up to the 63rd floor.  The huge pool area is closed for the season but the Moorea Beach club is open daily from 9-4 during the winter months. It has a small pool for swimming a large hot tub pool and a bar that was serving 2 for 1 beers.  The kids will like the Shark Experience Aquarium but make sure you see the included Undersea Explorer Virtual Reality area after viewing the Aquarium.
10,I stayed in 4107 and there was a screaming baby in the adjoining room 4105. The baby quite literally screamed all night long. I was forced ti sleep with the tv on to attempt to drown out the screeching child. I did not sleep for 2 nights and then my days were ruined because of the prior night. Many attempts were made at the front desk to request a room change for either us or them. Initially they lied and said the room next to us was checking out and the problem would be resolved. It was not. When I called that night to report the child was still there & still crying…the man on the phone said it was a mistake that they were never scheduled ti check out. He man I spoke ti at 8am had clearly lied.  Then the man I spoke to in the evening offered me a $100 resort credit and said he would have to speak to a manager ti see if he could move us. When I called back an hour later the manager said they could not offer us a comparable room. I wasn’t asking for an upgrade- simply a room not next to the screaming baby. The woman on the phone Bernadette I believe was her name - offered me earplugs. I asked for either us or them to be moved and she said she could not do that. She said my only option was a downgraded room with a queen bed when I had booked a king. This trip was ruined. The hotel representative said there was nothing she could do and I I was disturbed she could call security. I don’t know how security can stop a crying baby? I find it very difficult to believe there was not a single other king size bed available at this hotel. Again- not looking for an upgrade- I was simply looking for us or them to be relocated.    So I did not sleep for the entire weekend never received the resort credit and was never able to switch rooms.    I was referred this hotel by a friend however I am disgusted with the entire experience and will never recommend this hotel.    Our anniversary was ruined.
50,The resort has a shopping center inside of it. It also has multiple restaurants and snack centers. I enjoyed the Black Jack even though the casini wasn't good to me. This is a wonderful place to stay.
10,The Weed smoke in our room from the neighbors room seeped into ours and lingered. This forced my family and I to to leave. I had my 4 and 11year old with me. They are sensative to smoke and they get sick. This is a non smoking facility. Im extremely dissatisfied and upset.
50,Friendly staff clean rooms and casino. Great restaurants and atmosphere. I love MGM properties and rewards. I’ve stayed at multiple MGM properties and always received greats service from all staff. Will definitely keep going back.
40,bathroom lighting horrible it is too dark.  bathroom sink would not drain notified front desk attendent. Was never corrected.  Overall cleanliness is acceptable. Would stay again bringing my own light.
40,All In All the Place was Great - The Front Desk Did Everything they Could to Ensure I was Able to Check In Early and the Room was Great. Although the Hotel is Starting to Show it's Age the Place was Clean and I had a Great Experience - Would Definitely go Back
50,The rooms were very spacious clean and great service. The gaming floor was clean and plenty of space. We ate breakfast Della’s Kitchen great food at a fair price. I had a breakfast burrito and it could have served two or three people. The sweet tots and sauce were delicious.
50,The hotel room was clean  had an exceptional view . For the most part the staff at Mandalay Bay were curious . The house of blues restaurants Mac and cheese is phenomenal .it's a hidden gem in the Las Vegas area . The shops at Mandalay have a verity of high end clothing that I dig.
50,Might be off the main strip but mandalay bay has a lot of things to do. Plenty of restaurants for the foodies plenty of bars spots machine and table games. Check out the shark reef during your stay foundation room for a great view and drinks and S bar for amazing sliders.
50,We had a great time check in was easy. They kept our bags until we needed to leave. We always come here as it is our go to hotel in Vegas. The pool is heated have local places near by to get around. Love it!
50,First time to go to Mandalay Bay for a conference and stay at the hotel. It was a great experience. Room was clean and quite. Hotel restaurants worked well for eating throughout the stay. Conference center was convenient making the entire trip a success.
50,We had a blast!! Staff were friendly and very welcoming! Service was spot on. Our rooms were really comfortable and clean. Restaurants and entertainment was awesome. We listened to a live band and the food was delicious.
50,Mandalay Bay did not disappoint. The room was clean and spacious and an easy walk to Allegiant Stadium. The hotel has a great selection of restaurants. If you are on a budget the hotel Sportsbook has an affordable grill with good priced beers. In addition the in-room coffee maker is nice.
50,This hotel is a real gem in the Vegas world of hotels. Exceptional staff and the property has everything you need. Bellman Derek was super helpful and friendly. He went out of his way to help me and it was a pleasure to have his assistance. I will be back to stay at this hotel due to his professional exceptional service.
50,Although Mandalay is the last casino south of the strip the tram makes it easy to get north. Clean casino clean rooms with Great service . The casino floor is clean and even tho its a smoking casino it does not smell of smoke. We stayed in the penthouse sky view suite and it was very nicely appointed with high ceilings with a resort feel. With Mandalay... they never disappoint.
40,We had a Resort king view of stadium. Loved the ease of access to the stadium when we went to the game. Room was clean nice and spacious. Loved the tub and two sinks. Didn’t like that you had to pay for coffee but easy enough to bring your own.
40,Stayed here in 1999 and wanted to come again for our daughter’s marriage proposal. The stay was ok. Bar staff at one of the bars were not professional. Pool was closed. Key cards did not work well. This was an issue for other rooms as well.
50,I would highly recommend Mandalay Bay. As a single women I felt very safe. The hotel and rooms are beautiful. All the staff was great and friendly but one (Teressa a bartender). I will be retuning to Vegas and staying here agin. Also Kumi restaurant is amazing.
40,I enjoyed my stay the room was large and very clean. I didn’t get a chance to use the pool due to the timing of my visit but would highly recommend anyone to stay here if not not the great service for the cleanliness of the location!
50,I was at Mandalay Bay for a convention and with the crazy people up drinking all night I was worried I wouldn't be able to sleep. However the room was so quiet and peaceful I didn't hear anything and slept like a baby.
50,Patrick always takes care of us on each time we visit. For a few years we have came back to visit my wifes childhood friends and play at the mandalay and to be honest im not even interested in trying another place because of the hospitality I receive all around
40,I wish the tram travelled further from casinos and maybe even went downtown or to the lync. Obviously I think everyone misses the buffet but I’m not so sure if they’re gonna ever come back. Overall I would love to stay there again.
40,I went for CES and everything else was sold out. Being an older hotel I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the place. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The property was well maintained.
20,Not a place I would stay again. I stayed there 20 years ago and it was obvious that the upkeep was non-existent - very hard to justify paying $600 a night during CES - I won't be even considering staying there next trip to Vegas
50,The staff was spot on and very accommodating. Looks like they are constantly updating the look from the carpet to fresh paint. The variety of restaurants on the property will keep you coming back again.
50,This is one of the best places to stay in Las Vegas. Friendliest staff awesome rooms and great restaurants. Love staying at Mandalay Bay and plan to return You will not be disappointed love the casino
50,Went to Raider game. The hotel and game experience was amazing. I liked how the hotel and casino had the directions to the stadium from within the casino. Follow the arrows! It was fun because there were other fans here too and you could have fun with the rivalries even before the game started.
20,"Booked room via Chase Preferred. Price was $370 per night PLUS ""Resort Fee"". Room not ready at 1:30 advised to have Bellman hold luggage. About 3 PM received a text advising room was ready. Text advised to go to lobby and scan QR code to receive keys. (Nice personal touch). After the key process was completed when to the room and attempted to call the bell desk for baggage. Phone not working. Had to call from cell phone and go through hotel operator to bell desk. While at the desk desk light went out. Called again (on cell phone) to complain about phone and light. Returned to room after dinner and light was fixed but phone still out. In my mind this is a serious safety issue. Whet to turn on light between chairs and it was not working. Noticed that it was unplugged however there was no outlet to plug in the light. Went to shower and noted that there were no wash cloths. No paper or pen available to utilize in order to make list of complaints. Parking is $26 per day. Front office manager did waive the ""resort fee"" but.......Save your money and go elsewhere."
50,Great staff and clean accommodations. I like being at a Vegas hotel that’s not so crazy like the main strip hotels. Nothing to prove here just enjoying Vegas. A lot of hotels have people to prove something and seem fake. Here you just appreciate the hotel.
10,I booked a Mandalay room with a strip view. Room was outdated. Shower water pressure was terrible. I’ve experienced similar issues with other MGM properties. I am likely moving on to different franchise for future stays.
30,our room shower wall had to be cutout by a maintennce person while we were in the room due to some water issue.    also numerous cal;s had to be made in order to get our room cleaned.    No useable refridgerator in room    I was charged for removing liquor deom the liquor fridge when we never opened it up at all.    Room had dirt / dust in the corners.    MGM Reqards comment: I played for many hours a day while there average bet was $10-40 at table games and they credited me $3.10 for my play. Also minimum bets were too high and not enough tables were oprn.
10,We have stayed at the Mandalay Bay over 15 times. This is the worst experience we have ever had in Las Vegas. The house of blues we had dinner where my wife I love to go. It was the worst service I’ve ever had anywhere let alone Las Vegas. We didn’t finish our meal because the food was horrible. Our server took our order and came back to the table one time. Three tables around us had to chase her down to pay. We left and tried to order room service but after waiting on hold for 45 minutes I called the front desk. We were informed that room service was closed and there should have been a message saying they where closed. We were offered a one free breakfast. I then walked down to the citizens cafe which we have always loved and they were also closed. I understand other city’s cutting back but this is Las Vegas. This use to be our favorite place to escape and relax. It is worse than a motel 6 in Tim buck two. I wouldn’t come back here if they comped me and my whole family for life. I would suggest to anyone stay anywhere besides the Mandalay Bay!!!!
30,Rooms are dusty and dirty we are tired on our trip so we slept early and in the morning we just found out that the room is not clean. you can barely see dust on the lamps and tables The is a fries on the floor and a used straw were not able to tell the front desk because we are in a hurry on our trip to utah
30,Don't order room service unless you like cold food. And apparently that was the theme when ordering breakfast there. Everything was cold even when you complained and they brought new food. Eating dinner there was a lot better.
20,I love the Mandalay Bay and this is my favorite hotel but this last visit was such a disappointment. We stayed for 3 nights and two of those nights the hotel had no washcloths available ice machine only worked on the first day and no parking available because they were selling spaces for people watching football
40,Huge room great views and kept clean. Staff were friendly and helpful (esp when I left the key in the room). The floorspace is vast and the casino floor is certainly entertaining. Smoking seems to be allowed on the casino floor which I wasn't aware of but didn't bother me too much.  Bars and restaurants on site are reasonable but would recommend venturing out as well come on - you're in Vegas!  Would consider staying again if I return.
40,The hotel is very nice and clean. It's a great location for going to football game. The food prices are ridiculously high. The resort fees added to hotel bill are ridiculous. Can't use the room refrigerator for drinks or food brought up to the room.
50,We were there during a Raiders game sat in the bar area great beer bucket specials former Raiders player came by to sign autographs and take pictures. The FJ played fantastic music. It was a memorable trip.
50,Staying at Mandalay Bay is a treat. It offers something for everyone. It's a great way to treat yourself to special adventures from Shark's reef to shows and concerts sporting events great food choices and more. The staff are all friendly and help make your stay at the property a home away from home.
50,Mandalay Bay is and has been like a little piece of Heaven for my family friends and I. We always feel as if we are going to get everything that we desire under one roof with the Amazing Staff and etc.
10,Horrible stay. Beware of workers going into your room without knocking. Very shady hotel. All they can offer was 150 worth of free food so bad . Manager at the front was non friendly and very cold staff.
40,The hotel is nice and the staff is friendly. If going to watch a NFL game this is by far the best place to stay. Easy access to stadium and with the Luxor connected it offers great variety for gambling and dinning.
10,Bachelor party weekend panoramic two bedroom suite (king) the water pressure was so weak that it cut off during showers and in sink while shaving. Also found dirty panties and socks in the bathroom.
50,will come back for sure we all loved it room was very clean and shower was wonderfull we really recomend for friends and family wonderfull prices during the week monday and tuesday $60 a night well worth it
50,Clean casino with friendly staff. The restaurants there offered delicious food with friendly service. The Michael Jackson One show is a must see. The Sportbook was clean with helpful staff and giant telesisions.
10,Unlike my usual stays for the past 8 years  this is my worst experience. I will not go back. Very dirty bathroom and cheap skimpy towels like a motel. The food quality at the restaurant (Especially Noodles) are the worst. Do not go! Pricey and food was horrible to eat. Dealers are rude too
50,Mandalay Bay staff did an excellent job of making my Dad and I feel special. Always willing to answer a question with a smile. The bed's were super comfortable and we slept great!! The concierge helped get us set up on shows an she was awesome!
30,Poor housekeeping service. If you want a new washcloth per person per day you better bring your own. You only get one. And we had 3 people in the room. This occurred multiple days. Hotel is overpriced based on housekeeping service.
40,The resort is clean organized and well run. The Michael Jackson show was amazing. We would like to have more live music throughout the evening. Shower pressure was minimal at best. Gambling prices increased over the weekend. To high for our taste.
50,After all the bad experiences we had did the strip this hotel made our last night in Vegas a lot more special because of how quiet and the food at Border Grill. I think in the future I will stay on this side of the strip I think anyone who likes the quiet side of Vegas will  Agree
20,There were blood stains on the bed sheets No microwave and refrigerator in the room no bathroom door lock main door’s RFID panel was broken. Parking was way far from our room. Too much walk to the parking. Would not recommend
50,Always love everything about Mandalay Bay! The rooms are great. The spa is amazing. Restaurants especially the Foundation Room are exceptional. We love that it’s a little bit more quiet and relaxed than it is at other hotels on the strip. Always our first go to!
40,This property is a good and reliable place to stay in Las Vegas. Easy access from the airport and accessible point on the Strip. The amenities are good casino has new updated slots and the staff are all very helpful
50,A close walk to Allegiant Field. Provided a great location and quiet room despite being a very busy weekend in vegas. Border Grill was perfect before the game. Will stay here again as it was convenient and close to all the activities.
50,Clean room big bathroom with separate sinks and also a tub plus shower. Room didn't smell like smoke like some other hotels. Check in wall all digital and the 'key' worked though my phone although I did also get a normal electronic key just in case
30,I thought we’d get a quality service but to our dismay hotel wants to nickel and dime customers for everything! We were told resort was not available and spa closes early everyday. There’s a problem with the plumbing in the room but matter was not resolved. Most likely won’t be back.
40,Great stay and friendly staff at the resort the location isn’t ideal as it’s pretty far up the strip. Lots of Ubers and not much to walknto. Also there are things (like the rooms) that are starting to show their age.
50,I love staying here always have. Friendly and efficient staff always. Great casino and the rooms are very nice. Great selection of different sized rooms to accomodate any size party. Excellent rooftop lounges as well.
30,No access to the fitness center despite the resort fee saying it is included. They no longer have day passes for the spa. You must book a service The hotel will charge  you $50 to clear out the mini fridge so that you can store your own items. Best of luck if you’re not the type who wants alcohol in your room.
50,Mandalay Bay and Delano are wonderful! It’s not smoky and the staff is amazing. Excellent slot options with great variety. Nice room amenities and clean. Quick to respond if you need anything. Definitely recommend. You can hear the planes take off depending on where your room is.
50,I had an excellent stay. My room was very clean and the view was magnificent. The staff was all friendly and helpful and I was even able to check in early. I would definitely recommend this resort and can’t wait to stay again.
50,Everything was good just prices are over the top .need to lower prices because it’s too much . But overall everything was good we had a good time with my friends and family.we spent New Years but I guess everything went up since the pandemic
50,A great way to bring in the New Year's with a beautiful view of the strip as the fireworks go off at midnight.  Not just that if your a Raider Fan it's only a hop skip and a jump to the new dome.  Looking forward to my next trip.
30,Resort fee was high especially for winter when the pool isn't open. Ice machine on our floor didn't work and couldn't get ice from another floor. Can't use the mini fridge to keep things cold because it is used as a mini bar. Shower was moldy. We user the app to check in which was pretty cool since there was a line. It was just ok wouldn't stay again.
40,Great location if attending football game. Food and bsrs within prenises outstanding! Rivea very disapointing! Shabby clothes on old waiters and not even party favors for NYE..cheap! Most people wearing black clothing and no black napkins?!
30,room too noisy i never experice that before staying in Mandaly bay it was always perfect this time face to airport and the helicopters and airplaine noise did't let me to sleep .be careful and asked if the room is face to airport and if it's noisy .
50,We absolutely loved staying here. It was so clean and beautiful and comfortable! We had to walk so far to get anywhere but there were plenty of taxis available as well as the tram between Mandalay and Excalibur. I will definitely be coming back!!
50,Excellent service friendly staff and clean rooms. The hotel is in the southern part of the strip. There is a tram that connects to the Luxor and Excalibur which is very helpful as most likely you will be walking a lot during your trip.
50,Friendly staff fast checkin and checkout elevators fast and in crowded complimentary waters. Lynette at the rewards desk was incredibly helpful. Only issue at times is that sometimes it’s hard to get a bearing in the casino to get around to where we wanted to go.
50,We had a very pleasant stay. Clean comfortable rooms. A calm room environment makes it nice…no loud noise even with our room facing the airport! A nice range of restaurants on the property. I didn’t get to use the gym or pools.
50,We always have a great time at Mandalay. This was our first New Years in Vegas. I have lost track of the number of times we have stayed at Mandalay now. Nice rooms. Relaxing Spa great restaurants. Fun bars and of course a spacious casino. Always a good tine.
20,We have just started visiting Las Vegas again for the first time in three years. Prior to 2020 we normally went two or three times a year and we usually stayed at the Bellagio. On this trip we were invited by some friends who had already booked the Mandalay Bay so we decided to stay at the same hotel. This hotel needs some TLC and it shows. Public area carpets are worn and dirty guestroom corridors are the same. Lots of scuff marks on the walls corners and elevators. When we arrived in our room there was some curly hair (nuff said) on the bathroom floor. It's still a beautiful property but it is beat up. The worst part and what prompted me to write the review are the restaurant hours. We arrived back at the hotel one night after seeing a show elsewhere and our only choice for a meal was...Subway. Really? At a four star resort? Oh yeah and the buffet is closed permanently. Sorry Mandalay Bay we're going back to Bellagio.
30,There is an issue at the strip steak house and they confused my M life rewards points which took 30 minutes to correct and delayed the rest of the night from my wife and I. The hotel lobby line also was very long to correct a clerical issue that they had with my holding deposit.
50,Stayed at Mandalay as I always do for home Raider games its location makes it convenient to go to the game  you just walk over the bridge that is shut down no traffic to deal with. The rooms are nice just need to pay attention to detail like the filth on the vents especially the bathroom vents
50,Stayed in many MGM properties all very nice yet Mandalay Bay goes somewhat above and beyond in many ways. Actually I am back to Vegas in two more days for a 5 night stay at MGM Grand which in itself is nice yet I will stay at Mandalay Bay very soon again
20,I would not recommend staying nor will I ever return. The staff on the floor was terrible mainly servers and the cost of food will bankrupt you. I recommend staying farther down the strip in any other location as rewards no longer fit the needs of the customer and resort fees are outlandish.
50,They took care of us when we had a family emergency and couldn't stay for the weekend. They were very understanding and helpful in our time of need. We really appreciate their help and also not charging us cancellation fee.
40,Due to airline mess we were diverted to Las Vegas rather than Hawaii. Mandalay Bay offered the best option at the last minute. The front desk was amazing. You can’t always rely on housekeeping to clean your room. Just call the front desk when housekeepers refuse to clean the room.
40,A beautiful place to stay would be more convenient if there was a mini fridge you can use to keep your items chilled in a microwave for your leftovers from all the nice restaurants in the hotel. We had to eat cold leftovers
30,Smiling and attentive service were lacking at our stay for mandalay Bay. Floor drink service and bar service were very slow  No over the top service. I would have settled for a smile and small talk. There were a couple of bright spots.
50,Room was excellent. AC / Heater works great. Water temperature varies a little too much. Checking in also sakes a little long but that might be across the board in Vegas. They should also give estimated times for “room service cleaning”
10,There are a multitude of hidden charges that are not disclosed prior to booking or when you finalize your stay with the hotel. Everything comes at an extra charge from using the parking garage at the hotel pre- charged for items in the refrigerator while you wait for them to verify after checkout that you didn’t take items or even use the fridge (storing your own personal items inside will cost you $50). Very disappointing stay.
20,Meh  just ok room was dusty even though it was supposed to be an ultra clean room . I was unable ti valet park becuse they didn’t have enough employees and had to park in BFE. Also finding the Delano parking is very confusing . The best part of my stay was the Sushi restaurant which is fantastic
50,Mandalay Bay is my choice of resorts when I come to Las Vegas. It has a great casino family friendly but has adult entertainment as well. Great choices of restaurants. The staff all work so hard to make sure your stay is a great one!
20,I have traveled to Las Vegas 11 times this was my first time staying at Mandalay the room was gorgeous but the front desk staff was extremely rude and unprofessional I do not recommend staying there.
30,Ehh............. not to impressed. No human interaction and those stupid refrigerator and snack bar. If you where to even bump it omg you have to pay for it. It's OK for the money just not the best in vegas.
20,I had dirty sheets upon my arrival and plumbing issues in my room. I had to get another room. The key cards did not work well for the elevators which was very inconvenient. You can’t put your personal food in the refrigerator and there is no microwave.
50,The staff is very friendly check in process was simple the room was beautiful with lots of space. The bedding was very comfortable. The gaming floor was very big and had many options. The food and drinks were tasty and plenty substantial.
10,Soon as I pulled sheets back I see blood. Nobody came for hours to change. I dropped crumbs on carpet by accident. next day after house keeper vacuumed crumbs we’re still there. Nobody came to help all night. Staff no help. I’m good and payed 2000 to stay there. Rediculous and nasty
50,We will never stay anywhere else. So much to do on the property there's no reason to leave. There's excellent dining options beautiful rooms prime entertainment beautiful pool area with a lazy river and wave pool.
50,We stayed at Mandalay Bay after receiving a Black Friday deal invitation online. We were not disappointed. The staff was very friendly offered us a later checkout to accommodate our spa treatment the next am. The rooms are very quiet and comfortable. Mattresses are perfect. The aesthetician George at the spa was amazing! If only we would have had time to see One.
50,The staff is really nice and friendly the room is clean and cozy it's along LV Strip but less crowded. I had the privilege to get a room facing the Strip and it was nice. I will bring my family on my next visit.
50,"So I seem to keep coming back to the Mandalay Bay year after year. I do think the MGM rooms are slightly nicer and more modern but there is something about the MB that I really enjoy. It just has a great vibe awesome places to eat and the connection ""Mall"" area towards the Luxor is super cool. I will book here again for sure once again!"
10,We never received a text stating that our room was ready like the party we were with did. We had to wait in a long line for them to let us know our room was finally ready. We went up to the room and it smelled like a smoke box of cigarettes. It was the most terrible experience in a Vegas hotel we have ever had. After we called to complain about the rooms Smokey smell (plus everything else) they didn’t hold back and told my husband he was rude. I couldn’t believe my ears. Never in any situation that we’ve been through at any resort or hotel was “customer service” so rude and inconsiderate about the situation your staff put us through. I will never book through Mlife again. With that being said I don’t blame my husband for being rude to the staff. They were horrible!
50,Friendly staff clean and above service look and feel than normal hotel room. Great food offered throughout even into casino. Cleaning all areas found everywhere. Casino in great shape with lots of options for everyone.
20,Not as expected. Very understaffed all around. Long waits for everything from the valet to the front desk. No amenities. Gym had many broken machines. Star level needs to be downgraded. Not very happy with the stay.
10,Room not ready when promised. Room smelled of cigarettes when delivered late! Promises to help not kept. Communication and follow up non existent. Customer service SUCKED! Price gouging for water and coffee. All in all disappointing.
50,Staff is friendly rooms are clean every single restaurant we eat in had great food. The staff was very friendly and kind. Mandalay Bay is a class act we will be returning to this resort with our friends and we recommend anyone travelling from Canada do the same Mandalay Bay is a winner!!
30,Not impressed- bathroom was dirty toilet had stains and burns on seat hard water stains all over bathroom shower made it feel dingy and gross.  The fridge was completely filled with overpriced alcohol table top full of overpriced snacks that if they move an inch you are charged. Resort fees when using zero amenities- no complementary coffee in rooms.. feel buckled and dimed with less and less perks for your play.
50,Amazing place to stay in. Totally recommend for a vacation or getaway. Rooms are spacious clean and comfy. No issues with any of the staff from house keeping to front desk everyone is friendly. Wish we could of done more there but there is infinite possibilities of making the trips go amazing.
50,I liked the room we stayed in we got upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite it was very nice and spacious. It was clean and it had a dinning room area and 2 living rooms the only thing I didn’t like was the mini bar because I accidentally knocked something over and was charged
30,My bathroom light was not working. Called the front office. But no one came to change the bulb. I had to use my cellphone as a light. Just to park your car in valet. Takes an hour. They need to hire more people.
50,I booked a Resort King from for me and my husband to spend a few days around New Year's. The size and comfort of the room was great. I also really enjoyed having a soaking tub big enough for both of us in addition to a separate standing shower. The on-site restaurant Kumi is the best food we've ever eaten and the access to the shoppes and other restaurants like Burger Bar and RiRa's was great.
40,Great room! The check-in was a long line. Everytime we had to talk to the front desk we had to wait in a long line. Once in you had to go through the casino from the garage to our room - I didn't like that. I didn't go for the casino and I didn't want my kids to experience that either. Other than that the room itself was fabulous! Amazing comfy beds separate jetted tub housekeeping every day. It was great!
50,The decor is Amazingly beautiful! The rooms are very grand and the staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Room service was a life saver and the food was absolutely delicious!
40,Fun trip to Vegas. Great vibe in the casino. Nice clean room with great view of the strip. Hate the parking fee and scary notice on the refrigerator that if you use it for personal use you will be charged. Isn't that what the resort fee is all about?
50,We had a good stay at Mandalay. The front desk woman helped upgrading to a bigger room. Cleaning services were good. We will go back to Mandalay next time we go to Las Vegas. Front desk woman was so friendly.
30,No complimentary anything expect to pay for everything. Bring your own pillows one of mine smelled of vomit. No complimentary coffee and dont accidentally touch the snack try or the fridge. Nothing to see really the only aquarium is expensive.
40,Just worried that if bumped the dresser wrong that would be charged for the whatever accidentally got moved. Went specifically for the Five Finger Death Punch concert but enjoyed some other things as well.
40,Very spacious clean and well designed room. Enjoyed stay there. Went there for family trip and worked out very well. Smoke free casino and more recycling bins would be nice. Our visit was in winter time and no pool was open. Definitely looking forward to coming back to enjoy the pools in the next time. MJ show and Aquarium was awesome.
40,We came out for the NYE weekend. It was a fun and exciting visit the property was clean and well maintained the room was nicely spacious even though I wasn’t able to get my requested room upgrade and over all it was a lovely stay.    That said I will probably try to research a less “family-friendly” property in the future. A family checked into the room next to ours (with an adjoining door) and every time we came back to the room a child was crying or screaming. I appreciate that kids do these things and that the hotel isn’t responsible for the behavior of their guests but better sound proofing would have made a big difference. A lot of money was spent on the room if I’m paying that much a night for a room I should not be avoiding it hoping that the people next door will leave or quiet down.
50,Overall we had an excellent experience at the Mandalay Bay! Thank you room was clean and it was a really nice room! The food choices were good! We liked citizens! The live band on Friday night was also really good!
30,We went to this resort for new years and we’re looking forward to an enjoyable stay. Got dinner the first night and asked if we could get some silverware and were informed that it’s an additional charge. Also it took the bell desk over an hour to get our luggage to the room. They do not tell you till the end that there is an additional $40 resort fee per day and then will increase the room rent out of the blue. Our room charge was $331 for the first night but the second night went up to $631 and all we were told is that it’s New Year’s Eve. Needless to say we will not be going back.
50,It was great night I won some money. I’ma really happy!! I want to go back soon is possible. We’re expecting to celebrate my husband’s birthday Mandalay Bay is the best place to stay in Vegas I love it.
50,Very friendly staff and great experience. The rooms are great and the end to end experience was wonderful. The concierge service went above and beyond getting us restaurant reservations. Rooms were very clean and comfortable.
10,"This was an extremely disappointing experience. We were hoping to have a clean room and our room was still dirty from the guests prior to us. We walked into the room at 4:30pm and the bed were unmade dirty linen dirty towels on the floor and trash in the bins. We called guest services/housekeeping and asked for the room to be cleaned. They said ""no problem."" My family and I went to dinner and the Michael Jackson show and returned to room around 10pm. The room was still dirty!!! We contacted guest services and housekeeping 4 more times and they said ""no problem we will come clean it."" We waited for another 30 minutes and no one came. We contacted the hotel operations manager (Julian). He was a complete JOKE!! He promised someone would come and they did not. He did nothing to make this better. He only reimbursed us $35 for the resort which is an insult. $35 does not even pay snacks in the room. Finally at 11:30PM a lady showed up to clean the room. So the room we paid for was disgusting and dirty; therefore not useable until 11:30PM. Julian the hotel operations manager needs to learn how to take care of his responsibilities or stop working in guest services. Very sad experience which made us want to leave."
50,Clean and spacious rooms with super comfortable beds !! All the walking we did in Las Vegas was fun and exciting but the best part is going back to the rooms at Mandalay Bay and getting much needed rest in their exceptionally comfortable beds !!
50,We came down to get away from the rain in the PNW. The staff were very friendly and helpful from the check-in person to the casino staff.    We were able to charge our Tesla for free when we valeted the car.
10,stayed at this hotel with my family found drugs in my kids mouth that she found on the floor also my 3 other kids is hearing sex noises from the other room around 2 to 3am with loud music all they did was have someone clean the room i asked to change or upgrade to a better room or another mgm hotel and they couldn’t do anything …..
30,The room we reserved online is not the room we got upon arrival. We were told the room we reserved was based on availability. How does that even make sense? The room reserved online should be honored as that is what one pays for. The check in process took about an hour not acceptable! I had called and asked for the second room we reserved to be as close to our room as possible for my 77 year old mother-in-law traveling with us and had also called to let Mandalay Bay know we would be arriving at midnightish.    The staff at the cafe was very rude to my mother-in-law just because she asked for cream for her coffee! All customers should be treated with respect but clearly this did not happen!
30,Don’t get me wrong. The place is nice and the staff is great but I have some issues. I felt like I was being robbed by a high tech thief. Every thing in the mini-bar is on a sensor so if you nudge it it goes on your bill. I was charge for a $24 bottle Fiji water and a $12 bag of candy. I’m not even sure when they were bumped but I was charged. We consumed nothing! I find the  markup prices obscene and the sensors insulting. Don’t even get me  started on the prices of the alcohol. Another complaint I have is the restaurants are spread out over their very large facility. You can’t pop down for a sandwich or an ice cream. If you could find them. Most eateries are upscale. I assumed the are situation so widespread because there are 2 other satelite hotels adjacent. 4 Seasons and the Delano. It’s a huge property.
50,The room was cleaned when checking in. After that it was mediocre at best. For 2 days our room was not refreshed with clean towels and bed made. Power outage that affected the elevators. Couldn't get to room. Had to use service elevators. Management was not organized for the problem and just handing out water is not enough for the long inconvenience. Some guests were given some type of compensation and some guests were not.
50,Mandalay is a great hotel Affordable luxury and clean not to be overlooked next time your booking a trip to Vegas Still has some old school vibe to it as well It might be off the strip but sometimes that’s what you want
30,Better service at other MGM properties that are less expensive . Wifi service spotty for kids who like to game in the room while parents gamble. Eveleator service disrupted had to use service elevator. Staff does not go above and beyond.
10,Staff was rude (African American with braids) after I expressed how frustrated I was after our keys weren’t working after they ENSURED us that they would. She did not sympathize with us and it made me to believe she did it on purpose where our keys did not work for the second time.
10,I was beside a family that was very loud with talking playing music and tv volume. The kids were yelling and being noisy. I could hear all of this through the walls. The rooms were clean but shower is small. It’s about 30 minutes from the bellagio fountains via walking.    If you want a restful sleep stay someone else. It’s not worth the savings if you can’t sleep.
20,Dirty room (sheets were the only clean thing in the room) bathroom smelt like a porta potty ordered bathrobes never got them. Rude staff 19/20 that I had encounters with over priced parking. Better options available
40,originally booked dec 21 thru 26th. had southwest airlines cancel our flight and wound up staying 5 extra days. hotel was well prepared to handle the situation of accomidiating us for that period .professionally run and well maintained as always.would not hesitate to rebook in the future.nice roomsgood foodgreat staff.
20,Valet took 35 minutes to park. To receive it took 30 minutes. Player rewards desk reps are rude and takes 30 minutes for a reprint. I would avoid this casino if possible. The location is not ideal as well.
10,Our experience was far less than desirable. We spent two nights at the resort without having any water. As a non smoker the first thing you want to do is take a shower after being in the casino. On the first morning we were told they would have someone come to our room that did not happen. We were also told that they could not change our room out because there were not any rooms left as the same level as ours. That is unacceptable! We should gave been upgraded. The last day of our stay we woke up to no water again. We have taken video as evidence.
10,We made a reservation online a few months ago to stay at Mandalay Bay. We have never stayed here before and we were really looking to staying here over the Christmas holiday. We arrived at the hotel just after 3 o'clock which was check in time. We use the mobile app to check in and we got a message saying that our room was not ready yet and if they would let us know when it was ready. since it was after three we walked up to the counter to ask about our room only to find out that our room was not ready however if we didn't want to wait they could give us a standard room right away or we could wait until her room was ready. The lady at the front desk even called housekeeping to put a rush on getting our room ready. We decided to wait as we wanted the staywell room and left our luggage with the front desk. About two hours later just after 5 PM we got a message saying our room was ready. We went to the mobile check-in made our own keys and went up to our room. We noticed that the elevators that went up to our room were not the elevators for the stairwell room. We got in the elevator and went up to the 12th floor and walked into our room. We noticed right away that it was not a stay well room. We called the front desk and asked if the room that we were in was a staywell room. The lady that answered the phone from customer service said that the staywell rooms were overbooked and that they put us in a standard room instead. Keep in mind that nobody bothered to tell us that they switched our room from the nicer room to a standard room. In addition they were still going to charge us the same rate as the standard room had the strip view. So my question is why did they make us wait two hours when the lady at the front desk called housekeeping to put a rush on the staywell room when we ended up in a standard room anyway. Another thing I can't understand is if we book this room two months in advance why is it overbooked. To me it seems like they did a bait and switch on the room and I am not OK with that. The lady that we spoke with on the phone did say that they would offer us a $50 credit for one of the restaurants in the resort but that's all she could do. So apparently me waiting two hours for a room not getting that room and not even being told that I was getting a standard room is worth a $50 credit for a restaurant that they're going to comp anyway. That being said I would be very cautious about reserving a room or even staying at Mandalay Bay. Since this was our first time staying at Mandalay Bay and they left such a bad taste in her mouth I would not recommend staying here if they are going to consistently do a bait and switch on the room without telling anybody. There are a lot of other hotels that treat people with respect like they deserve and I would recommend staying elsewhere.  The staff at Mandalay bay should be embarrassed about how they treat their customers and should think about changing the way they do business. I know they probably don't care as they are making millions of dollars a day and don't care about that one customer. But I'm hoping that when people read this they think twice about staying at Mandalay Bay and consider staying at one of the other resorts instead .  Thank you for reading my post and I hope this helps you with your future visit to Las Vegas. Have a great day!
10,There was black mold in the bathroom urine stains on the toilet the bathroom floor was not clean and the mattress was unbelievably uncomfortable. Supposedly the hotel renovated they forgot our room
50,Mandalay Bay is one of the nicest and most desirable hotel/resorts to stay in Vegas we have been coming and staying in Mandalay Bay for past 13 years and whether it is summer time to enjoy the amazing set of pools or winter for Christmas season to enjoy restaurants and music … it is always consistently good and enjoyable. Our kids love the resort and have great memories here.
40,Check in process was easier than the check-out. But resort benefits and meals was not properly managed or coordinated. Unfortunately I ended up getting billed extra for adding a meal to my hotel room
40,It was a beautiful hotel and we wanted to stay longer. The smoke was a little too much at times. It would be nice to have a smokers section. The options to eat was pretty good and the location was great.
40,Room was nice and clean however there were expensive fees to use the refrigerator or coffee maker which was new to me and not something I have seen with other Vegas hotels. Location at the end of the strip was also more challenging.
50,Felt welcomed by staff clean rooms good places to eat safe and convenient. Stayed an additional night because we were having a good time. Front desk made our extension easy and didn’t have to move rooms.
10,Was terrible experience  We use to come there all the time probably the management is very poor  No good past 11 pm  A couple of times got food poisoning  Any time you go to get your reward card you have to stay at the line for hour and the answer is no one wants to work… maybe pay more?!!
30,I have stayed at Mandalay Bay numerous times and it’s always been my go to resort. I love the quality service and the rooms and the food at most of the restaurants. But this year I have been very disappointed in the rooms that I’ve gotten not the size of the room but the lack of care and maintenance in the rooms between no water during certain times of the day and on another trip cannot maintain consistent water temperature in the shower broken closet doors and when opening the windows to to stare at what looks like throw up on the window.
50,Mandalay Bay feels like an upscale resort. We visited in December. The bathrooms were luxurious with walk in shower and large bathtub. Rooms were large. Had a great nights sleep with soft cozy comforters and bedding. The room also had great temperature control. Very comfortable stay!
20,The customer service was non existent. The valet was the worst I have ever used. Waited for over 30 minutes for our car. I ask an attendant to check on my car I said I have been waiting for 40 minutes he came back after checking and said I had been waiting only 36 minutes not 40 and my car is on its way. The room had a noise coming from the fan that sounded like water running all the time. Was charged for things I should not have been charged for. When I called guest services from the room was on hold for a long time with no apology or any type of service. I will not be staying here ever again.
50,So satisfied with our stay great service food and came home with some extra cash . This was our second time staying here and we were not disappointed we had a great trip. Looking forward to the summer to come back.
10,At the time of check in the front desk staff gave me a card showing different ways of checking out. One of the ways was to fill out a card and drop it in a box near front desk and I checked out this way. I left the room at 10:45am on my departure date. The next day at home I noticed Mandalay Bay continued to charge my credit card and sending me check out from via email. When I called to solve the problem the staff was not very helpful nor friendly.    Mandalay Bay if the express check out does not work for you please do not give out that card at the front desk during check in process.
50,I always stay here the staff are always so helpful Stripsteak is one of the best steak restaurants on the strip - and being at the south end it isn't overcrowded.  Whenever I make it to Las Vegas I ALWAYS try to stay here!
30,Mandalay Bay check in is a mess and staff seem to not care for the guest experience. Rooms are still beautiful but the 3pm check in is ONLY if your room is ready supposedly? I feel of a to bad it is what it is attitude there now. They are proud to tell you they are the hotel of the Raiders and use them as an excuse even when they aren't playing in Vegas that week...lol Expect long waits and elevators to go down or be backed up. Get up early and out of your room if you would like it cleaned because they aren't coming back .
50,Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino was affordable luxurious and clean. The check-in and check-out were simple and quick. Everything could be accessed with your mobile phone...check-in check-out elevator floor hotel room parking gate.
20,Mandalay Bay has nice rooms but the check-in process was awful (mobile check-in doesn’t work) and the lack of table games in the casino is a joke. Blackjack all pays 6:5 no Pai Gow to be found. A loose dog was roaming our floor for an hour and we couldn’t get a hold of anyone by phone (front desk concierge etc) to report it.
10,I was very disappointed because I wanted to surprise my husband for his birthday and the room was dirty staff was rude nor kind ! It was a disappointment and ruined my surprise and was late to my plans
50,Met some good friends for a post Christmas getaway and had a great time. I stay at Mandalay quite frequently and have never had a bad experience. The resort rooms and customer service is top notch. Highly recommend it.
50,The rooms/suites are always properly-maintained. Friendly accommodating Staff. A Lot of security presence. Casino is well-maintained and doesn't feel claustrophobic w/ well-spaced games.  Good choice of eating establishments in the Mandalay complex.
30,Decided to check out early because of noisy neighbors turns out there is a 60+ check out the total not mention to me when checking out. Checked out out of courtesy so they can flip the room and this is how I was awarded.
10,Way too expensive and nickel and dime you for everything  Resort fee is only for pool that’s never open  Reef costs extra almost  $500 for 2 rooms that are not in a good location on the strip  Front desk staff was not accomodating
10,Turns out to go to the gym it’s an additional $50/day. It definitely wasn’t visible on their website.    The parking is super far from the rooms. Parking is also always full.    However the room was clean and nice.
10,When we first checked in to the room  the toilet was covered in urine  I have picture of it never got the chance to bring it up to the front desk I just decided to clean it myself  the room had a smell and was charged for strip view with minimal sigh of the strip
10,The hotel is old and lack of maintenance. During my two stays one room has broken bathroom door that cannot be closed (because the wooden door doesn’t fit the frame) another room has really severe clog in the walk in shower sink as well as the bathtub. I can also clearly hear people speaking next door or out the hallway which made my sleep quality bad.
40,Overall happy with our stay and experience- except Wifi was spotty in our room so we just used our own Verizon signal on our devices. Didn't utilize the pools (too cold) or the gym so the $39 resort fee wasn't actually delivering any value. If the Wifi was good and utilized then it would have been more appropriate to for the resort fee charge.
50,Wonderfully organized conference Health 2.0. I had the pleasure of being a speaker and receiving an award!    My family came to support and during dinners and after conference events the hotel concierge really went above and beyond helping us find value-based different and fun experiences. We will absolutely return!
20,My first room lock was tampered with so I requested to move rooms. I was moved to a room with a view of an air conditioning unit wasn’t worth asking for a different room after that. Went down to the casino staff were so rude when asking for any type of assistance. Checking out I realized I was charged for snacks and alcohol which I never ate or touched! Definitely prefer Bellagio or the Cosmo.
50,Great hotel all around. Rooms are great plenty of restaurants clean casino large pool area. Saw the virus de soleil show which was eh but everything else was great. Will hope to stay here again soon!
40,From staff to cleanliness the Hotel was all we needed to have an easy and enjoyable stay. I wish self-parking was closer to the front desk but that was it. The One show was fantastic and the coffee bar in the lobby and Citizen's Food was phenomenal...overall it was a great trip.
40,The staff at the hotel are one of the nicest on the strip super helpful and always looking to improve your time and experience at the hotel. The Sportsbook was not often busy and the bar staff went out there way to make a special drink for me.
30,Our room seemed pretty nice at the beginning. But no hot water first thing in the morning. No use of refrigerator unless you want to pay $50 a day. Have to request wash cloths. Hallway smelled like weed and smoke 24/7
50,Overall this property was an excellent place to stay. Our room was not ready when we arrived so we had to wait after traveling across country all day. That was annoying but everything else about the place was killer. It is quite large and my was given a courtesy electric scooter to navigate it or she would never have made it.
30,It still a nice resortjust bit old and hope their tech gear can update soon.    Security wise someone open doors in the morning didn’t clear who he was even nothing happening. Still shocking how could hotel let this kind of thing happening ?
50,The stay was nice and the kids loved seeing all the slots I wish we could have had time to visit the aquarium but unfortunately we stayed here unexpectedly when the freeway was shut down. The staff was great and the place was very nice and we will be planning a longer stay here next time.
50,Nice but we got one that has the door to go to the next room which sound was not blocked off. Could hear TV and guests in other room talking. We are there just the two of us and shouldn’t give us the room with door to access the other room
30,I didn’t get my refund back on my deposit so I paid cash on front on the front desk and charge my account on my credit card as well My total was $300 but I paid $500. When I called to make a reservation on the room they told me there’s $100 per day and then I pay that but today they didn’t refund the money back to me.
20,Upon checkin the elevators were out of order. I had to wait in a line for an hour to go up through a freight elevator. Upon entering the third floor the power was also out the power was out and the hallways were pitched black. It was terrifying. At one point I bumped into a wall trying to find my room and ran over my foot with my luggage. Finally get to my room and it’s dark inside I try to open the curtains but they only open a tad and I can see that my room is facing a wall. Worst view I’ve ever had on the strip! Dark and depressing room. The sheets and pillow cases didn’t smell fresh either. They comped me $50 for my inconvenience. Unfortunately I don’t see myself staying there again.
40,Having to pay for parking is weird. The motel was nice . The slots weren't giving and we spent over 3000$ in them. The bed and pillows were soft and fluffy. The bathroom had a nice tub but no jets. Would recommend this hotel.
40,We dont smoke. The smell of weed wouldnt let us sleep. The room was cleaned once only out of four days and when they did our glass drink ware wasnt replaced for new/clean ones. A bottle of water costed $22.00!!!!
50,Southwest Airlines made a mess of handling travel plans. It was nice to rest at a luxurious resort. Staff was friendly ambiance was vibrant. Room was clean and location to airport is good. Nice to rest comfortably.
10,Don’t fall for the skip the line until you land in Vegas. I checked in online then our flight cancelled. The property charged us for the resort fees and gave us an upgrade almost $400 in extra fees for a room we didn’t stay in because I had already checked in online.
50,Staff was courteous and kind. Had a clean spacious and comfortable room away from the loudness of strip. But the tram made getting to and from the strip easy; just make sure to watch for tram closure times.
50,Everything was good I like the we were treated and it got better till the end .one thing I I should mentioned is that the hotel stuff need to tell gust that there is event that going on weekend so gust will be prepared for the fact that the self parking is going to be closed and you can’t get out or come in that the only thing that I didn’t like.
50,Our room was really spacious with a lovely view of the Strip. The room had nice amenities such as aroma therapy and air purifier. The bathroom was large and neat with a water filtration system. Had a great experience overall.
50,Best hotel and excellent service and staff. Parking and all restaurants are great. I would highly recommend.Location is next to the striptram service is excellent.Entertainment and shopping in in house. Casino staff are super.
40,Stayed here for 2 nights and was well worth the price. There was an issue with towels for our room. After 15 minutes on hold with houskeeping i decided to stop at the front desk prior to going out to dinner. The line was too long so we called when we returned It took a few calls to get resolved. The staff overall were very good.
10,The room was not cleaned very well. There was some type of dried brown liquid on the desk and sides. There was a large clump of hair in the shower drain that I didn’t notice until I took a shower which was disgusting cleaning someone else’s hair the first morning of our stay. Then the second day the electricity went out on our floor the elevators were down as well. So then we had to take the stairs which were completely dark and I had to use my cellphone light to walk down which is a major safety hazard. We couldn’t even find our way out and ended up in the staff offices and then just went outside a random loading exit and tried to find a Main Street. Overall it’s getting difficult to try and enjoy the stay and wanted to provide this heads up so others can see if other hotels don’t have these issues.
50,Christmas weekend was great my wife and I loved the room and we were very satisfied with the staff. Bathrooms clean. The restaurants were also great. No issues with parking. We will be going back soon and will definitely recommed this hotel.
40,Stayed in an accessible roll-in shower room and it worked great for a person with disabilities. See photos posted. Plenty of space. Shower chair was provided promptly no issues. The room was not thoroughly cleaned but that was corrected on a request. Major issue we had was not being able to reach the front desk or the housekeeping department after 30 min hold. Other than that great experience. Note: do not plan on checking in early. It won't happen. They barely had our room ready at the check-in time.
40,Room was spacious and clean property generally was in great condition. However the thinness of the door to the adjoining room made me hear all the noise (even though they weren’t especially loud) which made sleep difficult. Also the Cardio room required no key to access had no towels and had dumbbells strewn about the floor.
10,Nothing like a power outage of the elevators and yet all of the slot machines and restaurants continue to work. Seems like an amazing money grab by Mandalay Bay without any recompense for those who just want to get to their rooms.
10,Don’t expect a clean room. Extremely long wait time to speak to a front desk person. I attempted to contact a representative to resolve the issue I had with the hotel room but I couldn’t get through for the longest time so I gave up.
10,Title says it all. I couldn't sleep all 3 nights at Mandalay. Staff was not a good help. Lie about $100 room-charge credit. It was not credited. Conversations which didn't sound loud also could be heard through the wall. Definitely there's no sound insulation between walls. I was in middle of two adjacent rooms during the night. Parking costs a lot especially you have to go out every day.
40,Why must I breathe in second-hand smoke from any other blackjack players? For that matter why do the dealers have to breathe it in for 8 hours? Cigarette smokers make up 14% of the population....you can't make them leave the damn table to light up? SMOKE LINGERS! What about the gamblers who have emphysema bronchitis or C.O.P.D.? I love Mandalay Bay but absolutely HATE the ashtrays at their tables. Evolve please Mandalay!
50,This resort is amazing and well decorated and it is my first time staying here. The resort has numerous restaurants and bars and the prices are very reasonable. There is no need to go anywhere else if you are looking for a place to go and unwind and have a great time!
40,This was the first time I stayed at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino. The staff was helpful. This is a large location recommend to bring walking shoe and taking the tram. You can find everything you're looking for without ever leaving the Mandalay Bay. Also sometimes the app didn't work for the elevator I recommend getting the keycard
50,Nice! Great place to stay!Beautiful pool!! Great lazy river! Very clean !! Just amazing place to stay!! A lot of restaurants near by and plenty to do in the area .. I stay in Vegas all the time but I really did enjoy staying here!
10,Got there upgraded on arrival ok good start went to room smells like dog urine and mold.. we dealt with it we decided to extend our stay but they wouldn’t let us stay in the same room we had to complain and boom it’s available….. we realized we forgot an item in the room after given the runaround for a few hours we called back and the guest services operator “Alicia” would not transfer the call saying she was the only one there. It took 5 calls to reach another operator who immediately transferred the call to a manager who was able to at least be professional and listened to my situation. It was somewhat resolved although I don’t have my item.
20,They charge you nearly $45 as a 'resort fee' on TOP of your hotel room rate + taxes. This despite the fact that the Beach (the main attraction of the 'resort' was entirely closed and unusable. I guess with the 'resort fee' you do get the same wifi that your smart phone gets plus use of elevators heading A/C electricity for your room and a modest selection of basic cable channels. Oh never never ever touch anything on the mini-bar and definitely do not open the mini refrigerator. These are the property of the hotel and even touching them triggers a sensor that adds $50 to your bill. So bring your own ice (and ice bucket) if you need to keep anything chilled like a bottle of white wine for your special evening. Other than that just standard for for a Strip casino smattering of machines some table games a few high priced restaurants higher-priced shops and you're all set.
50,I love this hotel and always wanted stay in this hotel I had the best view of my team; Raiders Allegiant Stadium. This will be my go to hotel when I come to Las Vegas always; plenty to choose from as far as food and things to do
10,Worst stay ever! Had to wait hours to check in to our upgraded room. Patiently waited and went to check on the status of our room to find out it still was not cleaned so we were downgraded and not compensated for the downgrade. We still paid the higher price. Asked for extra pillows blankets and towels so we wouldn't use the cleaning lady during our stay. Waited hours and never received anything our whole stay. It was just a joke. The room was tiny the beds were so small it was hard to fit and couldn't sleep. The light from next door shined constantly from under the door. The people in the halls were so loud all night kept waking up. It sucked!!!!!
50,Had a great experience. It’s nice and quiet. The food was great and the staff was friendly. Would recommend this place to anybody coming to Vegas for business or pleasure. I will be staying there again my next trip to Vegas.
40,Great trip. Room was clean friendly staff. Only negative was the member card services my friend got someone else's player card and so she never got any of the points bc she didn't realize the name on the card was not hers (wouldn't think to look and verify since you hand them your state ID).
30,For our first trip to Vegas we were very unpleased with the MGM brand and Mandalay Bay. The Slots and digital poker were very tight and offered next to nothing in give backs. We had the opportunity to check out many other Casino's and felt the MGM brand missed the mark.
40,No major issues will definitely stay here again. Also was not my 1st time. Location was great the food was not bad at all. Some of the restaurants closed very early which was a bit weird but fine. Until next time….
10,For being one of the premier hotels this is a really crappy one. The facilities are not nice the staff is rude it’s overly complex and extremely inconvenient. Watch for theft on the casino floor. Security guards just laugh it off. There is nothing available that is convenient or free as far as water/coffee kind of expected in Vegas but was not even good quality. Overall not impressed at all.
20,Water service out in am of 12/22. Cardio club fitness cardio club fitness room small equipment in poor condition.  Nicer fitness room in spa was extra $50 !! Water was out building wide morning of 12/22. Can I get a rebate?
10,Need some help. I had a one bedroom penthouse sky view suite at the Mandalay Bay comped for four nights and I’ve had this booked since July. ￼I was in the hospital for months and this was a celebration vacation. Unfortunately we check in tomorrow and I was going to check into the app but it says I only have an executive king room. When I called and asked why I don’t have the penthouse anymore they said it’s because they overbooked it or extended the stay for someone and it’s no longer available. I booked that room in particular for separate rooms inside of the suite. I spoke to the front desk and a manager and they said yes you got the short end of the stick but because you only put two guest on your reservation. You were the one that got bumped. They also said that they cannot upgrade me to any other suite because there were no suites left that are comparable to what I booked. They said I would have to pay for an upgrade to those suites (media horizon two bedroom etc). They also refused any basic suites in Delano. He said there was nothing that they could do and they are sorry. I mean I’m beyond frustrated. They also offered me resort credit and didn’t even credit that at check out.
10,We went to stay at the Mandalay Bay felt that it was a very high end resort was looking forward to spin family time with my wife and my daughter to celebrate my wife’s birthday and our experience was not nice neither with the room service at the front desk or the shops
50,Excellent location. Walking distance to Allegiant Stadium. Online check in was very convenient. Rooms were clean. Many good places to eat and was close to a mall.Would definitely stay again if I ever return to Las Vegas.
30,I was there for a conference. Less than 1/2 of the restaurants were open. Did a late check out and was locked out of my room at 5 am when I went for a run. The front desk staff was rude about it. Gym needs a good cleaning. The room was great though and ver clean
20,The hotel itself was quite nice. The room was comfortable and the overall space was beautiful. However there was a $50 fee to even open the mini fridge/use it (despite the fridge being listed as an amenity) and touching any of the displayed snacks automatically incurred a fee. Additionally our rental car’s catalytic converter was stolen overnight when parked in their parking garage. That entire experience really threw a wrench into our trip overall and Mandalay Bay was unsympathetic towards a theft that occurred on their property.
50,I absolutely loved staying here was my first time here.  Beautiful room stay in a double queen room very spacious .  Was also there during some type of NBA seminar and let me tell you the amount of 6ft plus guys there tall chocolate men yummm made my stay even better
30,The hotel and casino is very bright and airy and feels nice when you walk in. The Michael Jackson show is great! Made the trip for me! The night I was there it was a grunge type band and some of the crowd looked sketchy. I would check and see what is going on before I booked. Given the history of this casino seeing what looked like deranged men was very unsettling.
40,Love the bathtub and spacious closets in hotel room clean and quiet. Pool is not fully open during winter. Location is definitely not within walking distance to the strip guests can choose to drive call Uber or take the tram. If you have a tight schedule and want to spend most of time enjoying the strip maybe booking a hotel on the strip works better. If not rushing for anything staying at Mandalay is cost-effective.
40,The room was nice enough just not the best on the Strip. We went to Allegiant stadium so it was convenient to stay here. A little pricey for the quality of the room. This hotel is also smokier than others on the Strip.
50,Mandalay Bay was perfect! We were there for the Patriots game at Alligent stadium which is right across the street so the location was perfect. The staff were great as well as the food. The Michael Jackson show there was amazing and a must see.
30,The 3 nights I stayed in #4-217 the room temperature stat had to be on at 80.  The bathroom was still around 65 degrees tiles were cold. Underneath the bed I felt a cold breeze 1 night. I put a towel on the return air vent to stop the cold breeze and another infront of front door to trap the heat on the room.    2nd night the bathroom lights went out. I used the toilet light by keeping the door open. Please verify with the cleaner as she must have called someone to have the lights back on... another inconvenience.
50,I had a good time during my stay the room I stayed in was very spacious which was a double queen bed. I stayed on the 22nd floor and I had a good view. The hotel has a variety of bars to choose from casino was fine and I had no issues. The room was clean and the staff was nice.
10,"There were no non-smoking area. I was new to ""casino life"" and the cocktail waitress made it seem like I was bothering them when I asked for a hot chocolate although tipped them $5 and someone told me the customary tip is $1. But they were eager to serve people with out melanin in their skin with or with out them tipping."
40,Check in process was ok didn't feel like the staff at the front desk was friendly. just doing their job in a perfunctory manner. Guess I'm asking too much. Also the rewards program is not easy to manage. I always forgot to show my card and no one ever asked if I had a rewards card to remind me. That would be an extra level of service that wasn't present.
50,This wasn’t our first time to Mandalay Bay and it reminded us how much we LOVE every part of it. We will be back! Food was FABULOUS room was impeccably clean staff was all friendly and so helpful. Highly recommend!
50,The room is nice. Casino is big. Their restaurants have great food. There's access to excalibur and luxor by tram. My room's view was the pools. Nice to wake up and see the view. I love the noodle shop & the Libertine Social. Food was yummy.
50,My husband and I stayed at Mandalay Bay for 4 days and 3 nights. Checking in at the front desk was very pleasant. The staffs are very friendly and kind telling us about parking fee covers all MGM Hotels and providing us the hotel & the strip maps. The room is very nice and clean and bathroom comes with bath tub. Housekeepers clean the room daily without having to call front desk to do so.
50,Easy check in. Quick service and room was clean. Only thing was I had no view at all but overall value was definitely worth the trip. Would absolutely recommend to stay here. Didn’t get a chance to enjoy the pool because I went in December but will go back to enjoy the pool as well
40,Good location nice clean rooms good variety. Good variety of gaming restaurants and bars and entertainment. Close to football stadium and arena attached under one roof. Easy access to and from airport.
50,My reservation CSR was awesome found us our hotel in a matter of munutes. Our Check in snd out with CSR Jonathan and Andrew G showed us what good customer service skills are provided us with suggestions of dining and corrected our bill. I thank your staff for an wonderful experience.
50,Best beach poolgood foodclean and lots of fun. Staffs were very nice and helpful. Affordable price of food and lots of slot machines to choose and safe hotel to stay and nice view on our room fronting the beach.
30,Fire on our floor. Smoke in hallways and no one communicated with us. Sad to say that no one in the hotel ever communicated with us nor were we ever encouraged to exit the floor. We overheard 2 guys saying there was a fire in the freight elevator? Not sure since we were never told anything.
20,We had a family get together to watch college basketball. Ticket prices were not clear on the casino’s web site before the tournament and were not sold before the day of the game. We were shocked to find out the lowest price for the 1st day of 3 games featuring no power 5 teams was $160. Less than 1000 people in the stands for the 1st and 3rd games.
30,Rooms need refresh. Especially linens and pillows. Staff seems unable to provide much help and not knowledgeable with most basic questions about the property. Nickel and dime you for everything and want gusts to do it yourself such as creating room keys etc.
30,Parking is overpriced (double charged by self park kiosk and hotel) and the staff was not very friendly when checking in or when asked for help on the floor. Neighboring hotels were more accommodating when n our previous visits.
10,Numerous problems and false charges at check out. Stay here if you want nickel and dimed and very little sleep. Also hard water no shower pressure. No ventilation for all the smoke. Valet was rude. Run.
50,One of my best stays in Vegas yet the room was perfect had a great time will most definitely stay here again the selection of restaurants were great if traveling with children the shark reef is a must.
50,I have stayed at quite a few resorts in Vegas and this was the best stay I have every had clean nice people were great. I will continue to go back. Was an exceptional stay very relaxing and enjoyable.
50,My husband and I traveled from New Jersey to attend the National Rodeo Finals. We selected the Mandalay Bay because our friends were going to be staying there and we were so happy we did! It was a very clean place and they have a friendly staff. The restaurants were diverse and delicious! We will definitely go back again!
30,Location wise Mandalay Bay is at the end of the strip so traffic isn’t too bad and it is very close to the airport. There is a free tram service that runs till midnight which takes you to Luxor and Excalibur where you can walk down the strip. There is also a connecting bridge that takes you to Luxor to watch the Blue Man Group show. There are three Starbucks and even a Kungfu Tea place if you crave bubble teas. We enjoyed the spacious and clean room. Customer service was good as we were able to get a late check out. Housekeeping service was done daily but they neglected to replace our face towels. There is a Keurig machine in the room but there is a minimum charge of $12 for two cups of coffee. We brought our own K-Cups creamer and paper cups and used the Keurig machine in the room to make our own coffee. There is also a mini fridge. However it is sensory-activated like the snacks and beverages. You will be charged an exorbitant fee if you touch the items. Beware there is a $39/night resort fee. The cardio room (gym) is very small. It gets pretty crowded in the morning. It doesn’t have enough weights space or towels. Only one heated pool was open. The “beach” area was closed. I do not recommend the restaurants as the food is not good and pricey. One of them Citizen even had the audacity to add a 5% facility fee to our bill when we went there for breakfast. What a sneaky way to nickel and dime customers! Worst part of our stay is the heavy cigarette smoke. To get to the Shoppes tram station convention center aquarium Starbucks food court or restaurants you have to walk through the Casino which stunk of heavy cigarette smoke. In this day and age with so much research on the harmful effects of second hand smoke I do not understand why nothing is being done to ban smoking indoors or at least enclose the entire Casino area to protect non-smokers. We have the right to breath in clean air. Smoking causes cancer!
50,I was disappointed that there was no free breakfast nor coffee. For the price of the rooms it would have been nice to have the breakfast. The room was beautiful. I made a phone call on my room phone and I was charged $28.00.
30,Don't plan on bringing leftover food back to the room...extra fee for use of fridge and no microwave that I could find in the hotel. Other than that hotel was great. Alot of activity the weekend we stayed.
50,Our expectations were exceeded. The hotel staff was very accommodating and made us feel welcome. We will definitely stay there again. And the parking you pay for is not just for Mandalay Bay but for all MGM resorts on the strip you will be able to park at during your stay for no additional charge minimizing the amount you have to walk. Because the scale of the strip is massive and even with convenient parking there is a TON of walking.
50,Amzaing trip! Mandalay Bay is excellent!! The hotel staff is super friendly and professional. Casino was not too tight. Food is amazing and tastey! The room was spacious and clean (light was out in the bathroom) but not a big deal.
50,Our stay at Mandalay was everything we had hoped for. The staff was very polite and helpful and assisted us with our personal requests. The grandkids loved the Shark Reef and us adults enjoyed the Country entertainment during NFR.
30,We stayed at Mandalay Bay for the last few nights of the NFR. They did a great job showcasing the event. Unfortunately though when we arrived our room wasn’t really clean. There was a massive hairball in the shower drain the tub wasn’t clean and only one of the beds had new sheets on it. The cleaning crew was nice enough to fix it the next day but still kinda gross.
50,What I thought would be a cheap comp room far surpassed my expectations. The room is spacious and clean with a clean and simple aesthetic. The bathroom is large and comes with all the necessary amenities.    Highly recommended.
40,Mandalay Bay is a solid resort but fairly bland. They don't really go out of their way to provide the Wow factor that I look for on my Vegas trips. While it is a perfectly acceptable resort if you want to feel special and appreciated there are other places to go.
50,The rooms were great. Staff was super friendly. They had some of the most reasonably priced tables on the strip. They also have a free tram to the Luxor and Excalibur which made it easier to make it down the strip. Will definitely stay there again.
10,Phone apps don’t work with any consistency staff lies about ( a dozen guests all had the same problem) website amenities exist only on the website. Hot water for showers only when you’re lucky. Bad food
50,Whatever your favorite team/s great to be able to watch the game and keep an eye on the other games. In between game watching bars and restaurant around. Other entertainment are also available within the Resort proper. Convenient and easily entertained within the short distance. Thank you.
30,The hotel is now starting to show its age. Rooms are OK just nothing special.  The breakfast at the Cafe was mediocre at best.  Probably won't stay there again as there are much better options available
40,Rooms: Mostly clean. Leaky bathtub faucet dripped occasionally. Back-flow noise of water from bathroom every so often could hear neighbor really easily though shared door.    Casino: Not good. Machines were tight rare bonuses and no significant wins on a winning reel (wins were a fraction of bet amounts). Wish there was a better variety of machines.    Restaurants: On the pricer side but delicious. Recommend the Seabreeze Cafe Rivea (for fine dining $$$) and the Mandalay Shop restaurants (Burger Bar was phenomenal one of the best burgers I have ever had!). Sports book food was bland( no meat options for the nachos really!?) service was kind of slow too.
50,I enjoyed every minute I was at Mandalay Bay everything is top notch and everyone that works there provides top notch service. I look forward to my next visit to Mandalay Bay. The only thing I missed out on was the dining experience I look forward to that in my next visit as well.
30,Going to leave a fully honest review.  Check in was 90% good. Used valet. The lovely women with short brown hair was wonderful 🌟.  Baggage service needs improvement. They were called 3x and didn't come over. Finally came and gave us bad attitude.  Check in was good. Very helpful kind girl from China. So so sweet and helpful.  Room was mostly clean. Found some mold amd wall paper peeling. No biggie though. It wasn't the toxic mold.  The bed was extremely comfortable but later we found blood on 1 pillow.    The first night there was a guy screaming and crying extremely loudly for 6hr. Plus his dog barking. It took 5x call to security to finally resolve it. The first security that came to our room was very good. But the issue wasn't resolved yet. We were given a food voucher as an apologie. So that was good. The manager is very good at her job.    We had our simple wedding the next day. It was ok. Not great. Definitely not worth the cost at all.    The next day was pretty good over all. That evening we tried to use the voucher at at steak restaurant in the hotel. (See my other review for it. The restaurant has very low reviews so I suggest you avoid it. The hiring manager needs a refresher about to hire better people.) We went to the Japanese restaurant kumi and it was wonderful. Good hostess good service good food. So highly recommend it.    For some reason our room was very cold. No big deal. Turned the heat way up and got an extra blanket. Very good hospitality service. The maids that clean the rooms are so kind. So very good hiring there.    Now checking out.... we called 3x to get a baggage cart. They never arrive. We needed to check out down stairs to make sure the food we got was comped as promised. It was btw. We left carrying everything. We get to the front desk and the girl working the morning shift on Wednesday with the dirty blonde frizzed hair was beyond horrible to us. She was more focused on her friends that were behind us. We asked where to get my valet parked car and she ignored us. Never asked how our stay was. Never made eye contact. And we were nice. Didn't even mention the bad stay or the bad baggage service. She was nasty from the moment we walked to the counter. We were then given the wrong info and told to go to the Uber pick up area to get our car. I said that didn't Sean right and the employee insisted that's where we needed to go. Don't get there to get your valet parked car.  I asked for help at the bell hop desk. 2 gentlemen very kindly walked me down to the area to get my car.    Valet is 4.9 stars 🌟. Only because on getting my car I was told it was parked in the wrong place. No biggie mistakes happen. It just we missed out appointment after this morning checking out.  The concierge was very good. So highly recommend them. Very helpful.    So over all the stay had it's ups and downs. Wouldn't stay here again. I mean we weren't expecting a luxury experience. We know this. Definitely wasn't 4 star though..  Sorry.  Rooms are good over all. If some service was better then I'd recommend it. I can understand sone employees having a bad day. That's totally understandable. But the nasty ones we encountered that was just their personality. We were even treated like we were poor. Girls we are not poor. We have a house in Hawaii and Italy. Have luxury suv. My outfits I had on were $200+. We fly first class every where we go. So don't judge a guest by how they dress. We stayed at this hotel because we were getting married here. Was just easier than all of the stress getting documents done in Europe. We are still having a wedding in venice italy for the family. So it wasn't about cost. But we are wise with money too. Cautious and do not allow others to take advantage of us. We are not super rich but not poor. And some employees treated us like we were beneath them. Shocked by this. Also we liked this location because we didn't want to deal with an overly crowded hotel. Like ones central on the strip. The whole hotel it self was very clean. Hardly smell the smoke 🚬 except on one day. Do good filtration system. You can't smell any smoke in the rooms when is wonderful too.    I understand Vegas is quick quick but we didn't appreciate being rushed at times when some employees acted like they didn't want to be there and dragged their feet. Guess they rarely fire people cause some had the attitude they could do what ever they wanted and were safe.    I've worked for casinos. Been magement in a few different fields chef and so on. So I understand what is expected of employees. Was shocked by how some behaved here. But also I'm sure its the location. I'm sure maybe places are desperate for employees like my companies are. And many employees lie and get friends and family to lie for them to get the jobs. I don't blame magement fully on this. People are people. There's only so much you can do. But hopefully these employees get the correct reprimand so they do not piss off the wrong guest.
50,Great property- super quick from airport. Using MGM App to check in means you go right to room with digital key on phone. Huge room great desk space and lighting. Has tub plus shower. Easy access to casino UBER Dining. Only complaint was loud guests in hallways at 3am both nights
50,Huge thanks to Crystal and all the management at Mandalay Bay for their help and understanding when my son’s wedding reception plans changed. You were so gracious and generous in making the necessary adjustments for our family and friends to have a perfect day!! We appreciate you so much!! Thank you 😊
50,Beautiful solo trip!!! An amazing 3 days excellent service! Beautiful hotel! Room service was great for breakfast and dinner! A great relaxing short vacay with an amazing view!! Will be back again soon!
50,Really CLEAN COMFORTABLE Really Good Security presence (not overwhelming but present and attentive) Good Uber Pick up/Drop off area. Housekeeping was thorough consistent and fast. Bars & lounges clean and comfortable. Casino not Smokey!
50,The hotel was connected to many shops bars restaurants casinos shows and other hotels. Lots to explore and enjoy right there. Plus! It was near the airport (less than 15mins)! The rooms were clean and room service was amazing!
20,Room could’ve been cleaned upon arrival. Housekeeping were only leaving towels. Hotel is not as close to the main strip as I was lead to believe. I’ve had better guest experiences for cheaper amounts. General area trash was left overflowing for over 2 days.
10,What a hassle between MGM/Pop Slots emails! 3rd floor corner room strip view what a joke! All we seen was the roof of Mandalay and top half of Luxor! Granted it was a FREE room but $44 IN RESORT FEES AND $26 VALET! WHAT A SMOKING HOT DEAL!!! Shower looked clean when I hopped in but water wouldn’t drain because a ball of hair covering drain! And I am bald🤷🏽‍♂️
50,Excellent overall experience! Service and food was amazing! Drinks nice and strong lol! Great bands at Riffs! Only faults were the DJ wouldn’t play requests after the band & the hotel at end of strip.
50,Go to the convention and take the family along so they can have fun while you work. Watch out for high food prices on the strip- there are plenty of memorable experiences for everyone but allow a shopping budget.
50,I have been staying at Mandalay for YEARS I have always had a great experience there and if there is an issue it has always been addressed and handled. I very rarely have an issue with this hotel. It is like going home!
50,Great property well maintained. We were there for NFR. it didn't disappoint. Fun stuff going old all day. Great restaurants we at at Flyer it was delish. We had the ribeye steak it was perfect! We cain't wait for next year.
50,Mandalay Bay is a hidden gem love the location love that we can walk form Mandalay Bay to Luxor Excalibur or take the tram as its all accessible through the hotel. Can't tell you how CLEAN this hotel is as well as their ROOMS!
50,From the moment we checked in to the time we checked out everyone was sweet and helpful. The restaurants were all good but my favorite was citizen. The room was big and beautiful and clean. The casino floors was nice and clean.
50,This was my first-time visiting Las Vegas notably for the ASHP Midyear pharmacy conference. I must say that I was very surprised by and satisfied with the quality of the services provided to me the hotel atmosphere and the ease of access to the convention center. In fact I was so impressed that I am planning to return to Las Vegas in July with my brother before his wedding and we are deeply considering staying at either Mandalay or Delano for this trip.
30,All of our points disappeared with the new program the refrigerators have been removed no wash cloths not as clean as usual had to pay for parking with new points program. None of these changes were for the better.
40,Mandalay Bay was OK. Not enough entertainment/bar options as I would like. Was lively due to NFR in town.  Housekeeping issues/cleanliness during this stay. Need a larger cashier desk or other desk. Lines long .
40,Stayed at Mandalay Bay during a quick trip to Vegas in December. We made good use of the free tram as the property is located at the far end of the strip. Check in was easy and the hotel had associates working the line with IPADS to speed things up. Check out was mobile. Housekeeping was provided daily or you had the option to skip housekeeping. Room was clean and large and well appointed. There are limited TV channels - and movies were also available - although not sure what the cost was. We did have a strip view room and there was loud street noise throughout the night and we were also able to hear loud guests from the hall during all hours of the evening. Pool was open in December but it was too cold to enjoy. There are plenty of restaurants coffee places etc on property for breakfast and snacks. The property was hosting several large events over the weekend and it was very crowded.
50,The Mandalay Bay resort is conveniently located close to the airport at the South end of the strip. The hotel room we stayed in was very clean and had no odor at all. The casino was relatively smoke free for the most part!
30,Excellent room. Still some lingering COVID deficiencies; including in-room service downgraded to boxes and bags (not plates trays and silverware). Spa staff was snooty - for no good reason. Also odd hours for restaurants and room service; even the staff was unaware of the changes. Guest services told me that room service was 24 hour - but it was only open from 7am - midnight. Poorly trained staff at times.
40,Pleasant trip. No issues. Not excited about incidental costs i.e. water soda snacks etc. were very expensive. Room was great clean everything in order. Staff very helpful and provided many suggestions to replace a concert that was cancelled.
50,Friendly and early check in best thing ever.  Clean rooms always had everything we needed.  Nice staff very friendly and always made sure we had everything  Restaurants were so good and yummy  Seating and watching NFR was a blast
50,Service was great. Loved our room. Strip view was beautiful. Cleanest hotel in Vegas!  Just wish we didn’t have to pay resort fees. It’s winter so you can’t use the pool and also. We did not use the exercise room.
40,We stayed here for one night on a comp and I would definitely stay again. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. Be aware that you are not allowed to use the room fridge for personal items or you will be charged a hefty fee--it was full of expensive beverages. Other than that it was all quite nice.
20,Worst customer service experience I've had in Las Vegas. I felt like I was bothering them just for showing up for my reservations and paying over $1100 for just 3 nights in a basic room. The parking is too far from the hotel and the food at the restaurants are average at best and way over priced. The room key doesn't work in the parking garage and again any time you call any of their employees for help they act like you're bothering them. My 29 year old Filipina wife was required to show her ID but white young girls were never asked to do so. I just had a bad experience with this place and left with buyer's remorse.    On the flip side the room was very clean and the cleaning staff was friendly. Loved the bed sheets and comfy pillows.
40,Bed was great. Wishing for more fun restaurants. Noodles folks are always fun. Person sleeping in the hall. Half lit cigarettes on the hall carpet multiple days. Security !!! Overall. Fun trip. Hey I was even !
50,We came to Las Vegas for the National Finals Rodeo my wife is a competitive rider. The staff were great very helpful and knowledgeable with all of our questions regarding the hotel. Everyone employee wise were all very personable and professional. Great job Mandalay Bay you knocked it out of the park! Oh yes and I did donate some of my hard earned money to the Casino Gods! 🤣🤣
40,Overall it was a great stay. Place is very clean and friendly. The only problem was locked fridge and not functional coffee machine that I had to pay for in order make coffee in the room. Also water and everything else required payment.
50,Stay was extremely accommodating. Easy check in and easy check out. Staff was extremely friendly in all parts of hotel and it was a greatly enjoyable experience. Would highly recommend and specifically become an MGM Rewards member
50,The staff was a joy to work with from check-in to Housekeeping Security and Check-out! I left my wallet in the Casino Restroom but it was recovered by Housekeeping and returned with all intact! WOWZA! On top of that our room was lovely and we truly enjoyed our stay.
50,My room and bathroom was clean and fresh. Bed and those wonderful pillows were very comfortable providing me a deep sleep I hadn’t been fortunate to have in such a long time!    Even though there were smokers on the casino floor you’d have to be next to someone to actually smell any smoke in the air. I fell asleep pretty early woke up with most of my one day trip gone and by the time I ate dinner and had the best glass of (non-flavored) lemonade of my life at Border grill I had to get sleep to ensure I was awake for 3:30am to catch a flight.    I’d definitely have to visit Mandalay Bay again. I just wish I had more time to stay on this trip to sleep and play and drink more lemonade…in no particular order!!!!
30,Internet is spotty at best. If you are here for business make sure to bring your own hotspot so you can connect without being dropped. You also can not use the in-room fridge for left-overs or to keep anything cold as it is fully stocked with alcohol and if you remove anything to make room you are charged.
50,Rooms were extremely clean and spacious with very comfortable beds. I never waited long for an elevator despite the size. I was there for an event at the Convention Center and it was so easy to get to. I ate at plenty of the onsite restaurants that were pretty good. The only downfall is that this is the first hotel on the strip so there aren't many other properties close enough to walk to.
20,I recently stayed at this property and it was a disappointment. One morning of cold showers due to a maintenance issue. The roof was leaking water in my hallway and no answer from the front desk after holding for over five minutes. They have issues here.
50,The hotel is clean. The people are friendly. The sports lounge is huge with a great atmosphere.  The cowboyville was so much fun!    The food at the citizens restaurant was so good. Particularly the rib eye that was on special for the rodeo.
50,We stayed for our anniversary and even though the town was completely booked we had a nice room walked around the property found an walked around the property found a great path around the pool was impressed with everything we saw and a pleasant stay and saw fantastic show at Mandalay Bay!!  Highly recommend.
10,Prices are outrageous. Why not just charge your resort fee within the price of the room. But honestly $44 daily is a bit ridiculous. Toll free and local calls included like who doesn't have a cell phone at no charge. Plus the rooms are starting to be dated.
50,I had been to Mandalay Bay several times for a business conference but was never able to stay there. I am so happy we chose this hotel I just felt very comfortable there. I like the hotel theme everything is clean and the choice of restaurants is very good. Even though the hotel is at the end of the strip it is fairly easy to get to the other hotels/casinos.
40,It was an ok experience location is far away from the center of strip. Hotel does need renovations. Elevator buttons on my floor were broken. A couple of buttons in the elevator were broken as well. It was hard to find help.
20,Upon check in I received a room with an unmade bed bloody kleenex in the garbage and used hand soap.    Upon checkout the bell hop tried to talk me out of check my bag refused to do it for someone else and begrudgingly took the bag for the lady in front of me all while complaining and acting like it was a big deal.    First and last impressions are key this is not OK.
20,Ordered room service. Salad and Alfredo pasta with chicken- Both tasted like they were from processed foods horrible quality. It was very overpriced- which should have come with some type if quality. The sauce tasted like it was from a jar. I would never try it again. ( I travel a lot and get room service often.)
50,We wen't to Mandalay Bay in November and it's was our 2nd time there. We loved our trip the hotel is clean great and so big.  We also went to see the Aquarium wow it's incredible. If you go don't miss the special presentation 4D since it's included but nobody told us that it even existed so ask where it is you won't regret.  The only thing that we don't appreciate is the fact that all the shops are too far from the hotel to get water etc.  Thank you Mandalay Bay for another great stay.
30,Average stay I’ve been in better.No free use of refrigerator instead $50 per day and also no body wash in the bathroom.I have had this stuff for free in other cheaper hotels. I was expecting more for the price.
20,This was my 4th stay in the last 2 years at MGM properties all with the same result. Awful air quality noisy HVAC systems and dirty vents in dated rooms resulting in sinus and respiratory issues (NOT COVID). NY NY Luxor Mirage and now Mandalay Bay. I get that these are the lower tier hotels that MGM offers but there is no excuse in this day and age to have such awful air quality in rooms. I have stayed at Aria and MGM Grand pre-Covid with no air quality issues but since the shut down it seems that all their resorts have these common problems. Why else have the shops started selling sinus and nasal congestion medications and portable humidifiers when these were few and far between previously. Add to this the revamped MGM Rewards which pale in comparison to Mlife. Never had to pay for a stay before now I am lucky to get one night comped even though I am at the same level as when I was with Mlife. I have already booked with Caesars for 2023 and suggest others do the same.
40,Mandalay Bay is one of the few older hotels in Las Vegas that is still in great shape. Excellent staff and the rooms are fresh not tired like some of the older properties. This place and the people here will bring me back.
30,Pillows are very uncomfortable. Love this property. They need to work on their check in service to ensure you get a room that is how you want and is clean when you get to it. They have done a better job keeping prostitutes out of there and not bothering their customers.
50,WOW Stayed 4 nights first week of Dec. attended pac 12 game. Great location room was super cool with strip view. I would recommend this place even if you don’t use the pool. Fleur steakhouse with Adam and Josh was excellent Hazel coffee bar in the morning puts Starbucks to shame. Awonderful trip
30,it might work for some but didn't quite work for me so here are some pros and cons:    Pros:    1. Looks clean fresh well maintained.  2. Located on the Strip. It's a bit far away from the central part and the main attractions but having a free train to New York New York helps. So it's ok.    Cons:    1. Greed. If you try to make a cup of coffee in your room - it's going to be $14. By the way we got billed for the items we didn't even touched at all. Good news - they dropped them at the check out without any arguing. Bad news - I couldn't use express checkout and had to spend time. Even worse news - there are surprise charges everywhere. Coffee water fridge parking gym ... It just ruins that worry free spirit a resort supposed to have.  2. Service. I tried calling desk number a couple times ... Ended up taking elevator and going to the front desk because I was put on hold for too long.  3. While rooms are generally quiet the heater made some loud rambling noise ... combined with oversized uncomfortable pillows ... not good rest.  4. It feels just too big and empty ... A lot of restaurants and shops are still closed ... It may be a good or a bad thing depending on what you're looking for.    Overall it's a good looking hotel but not a good value.
10,Overprice with poor customer service and rewards program. We stayed for one week and had daily disappointments. We will never stay at an MGM owned resort again. save your money and have a wonderful experience at the Southpoint.
50,Rooms were clean and updated. Staff was friendly. Close to the stadium and you can store your luggage with the very friendly bellman while you attend the game.Part of a monorail system between hotels which cuts down on walking so far. Smoke free casino. Overall a good vakue for your money.
10,DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER COMING HERE WHEN THERE IS A GAME AT THE STADIUM. The parking is a total nightmare 2+ hours to get parked and Valet was not an option as the line was down Mandalay blvd out on to Las Vegas blvd.. Don't plan on eating at the resort there food choices are very limited and not setup for large numbers of people. So when the resort has even a small number of guests Forget about getting any food here. Water in the room is $25 for a med. size Fuji bottle so as the check in desk guy says bring your own unless you really need it. The Beach Pool is closed this time of year which is not clearly posted on there website. This was a bummer we wanted to check it out for a future trip this summer and was told the only way we could see it was from the glass hallway by the convention center like a zoo animal. A light in the bathroom was out and the bathroom door squeaked badly enough to wake up other people in the same room.  Not a very friendly experience overall. Not very family friendly at all.
50,Mandalay Bay offers many different opportunities for entertainment and the quality of all that I have experienced have been top notch  I have not experienced a bad meal in my numerous trips  and the service has always met or exceeded my expectations
50,Stayed here during my a week long visit to Vegas recently. The hotel is excellently located with access to the strip and all other activities. The rooms were spacious and clean. The staff was friendly. I will have no hesitation to stay here again on my next visit back here.
40,Had a great weekend at Madalay. Loved the ability to walk over to Allegiant Stadium. Clean facility. Good restaurants. Casino floor is either too big or number of people playing was very low. Felt empty even with major events in town.
50,Mandalay Bay Hotel Resort and Casino is one the nicest and spacious casino I ever been in Las Vegas. They have variety of restaurants and shows. Their slot machines are not crowded together like most casino and staff are helpful and friendly in all service department.
50,This hotel in my opinion was run better then any in the chain. The check was seamless just printed keys at kiosk and walked to room and they worked. Seamless walking to Allegiant Stadium. Staff very helpful and met all my needs and hotel has so many food options.
50,Beautiful hotel very nice hotel entertainment. Rooms are beautiful. Very friendly staff. The casino is one of the best we’ve experienced . Variety of machines and tables. We visit las vegas and the MGM hotels on a monthly/bi monthly basis for gateway purposes and we always enjoy the different MGM hotels. Our favourite by far is the mandalay bay
10,We stayed in Mandalay but our oversized van had to be parked in the parking lot of The Luxor. The security must be really bad. We parked right in front of the security cameras right on the strip. Not only did criminals dry cutting our bikes off the back they also messed up our door locks trying to break in. Fortunately they couldn’t get through the locks and the doors to our van but they sure messed them up. When I called security they told me they would call back and then didn’t. I called back again to make a report and got nothing but a song and dance. They also actually told me it happens all the time! This really put a damper on me ever coming back. Why not get some decent security for the $18.00 you charge to park.
10,The Check in staff were not friendly or helpful. The cleaning lady did not clean my bathroom. There were loud guests that interrupted my sleep. Resort fees were charged and the hotel did not offer any “resort” services. I’ve stayed at much nicer “resort” hotels and “resort” facilities were offered but “resort” fees were not charged. It seems to me that they were more interested in making money than making customers happy. I will not stay there again and I will not recommend that hotel to anyone. I will tell everyone not to stay at Mandalay Bay.
50,We almost go to Las Vegas every year for Thanksgiving or X'mas. Mandalay Bay is a good choice for my family: the space of standard room is great and bathroom (with a big bathtub) is always my hubby's favorite.
50,Room was clean quiet. Casino was not over crowded. Easy to get to Alegiant stadium. Parking was not a problem. Sports book was comfortable. Bar staff was friendly. Will definitely stay there again on return trip.
30,Nice space but everything is an up charge. want to use the coffee maker in your room buy water and coffee from minibar. Want to use the nice gym pay additional money. What is the resort fee for if the gym is an up charge per day per use.
30,Rooms and service were outstanding. Vey clean and comfortable beds.  Our first concern was the message that warned us that there was a sensor on the snack trayand if was touchedwe would be charged. We didn't eat a thing of even open the refrigerator. However my wife's purse touched it and we were charged $18.00. They said that they weighed it and we were refunded the $18.00.  The other concern was the ridiculous cost to eat. We understood that we were at a high dollar hotel but being able to eat three meals per day is outrageous. The cheapest place to eat was fast food at the food court A basic hot dog french fries and a drink is. $24.00.  I'm not trying to bad mouth this beautiful hotel. I just want to inform people of unexpected cost.
30,Being one of the premium resorts in LV and for the price/ night - they don’t even provide a coffee machine or microwave.  American Greed at its best !  The cleaning service on the 3rd day was baffling !  Clearly he did nothing else but just so the bed.  All the trash was still as-is.  Bathrooms were not cleaned ! Seriously?    Need I say more ?
30,This was my first stay at this property and it left me disappointed. I stayed in on of the Resort King Strip View rooms on the 23rd floor.    MGM will nickle and dime you on everything from the high daily resort fee in-room services mini bar and snack trays.    Housekeeping didn't bother to clean the bathroom floors which forced me to put down towels to avoid stepping on someone else's mess.
50,Our recent trip to Mandaly Bay resort and casino was wonderful. From the minute we entered to check in until the time we checked out the staff could not have been any more accommodating. The VIP experience offered is great and well worth considering if you are not at a Platinum or NOir tier status (if you are your casino host will arrange it for you). The resort has many exceptional restaurants an expansive casino with basically any gaming you could want great rooms great pools and overall its a truly phenomenal resort.
50,A excellent resort to stay while visiting Las Vegas. They have everything you need so that you don’t have to leave the resort unless you show tickets at another location. They are attached to a shopping mall they have restaurants and of course a casino.
10,"Charged $44/day (over five days) for a ""resort fee"" - which was not visible in my company's travel portal. The fee is for internet access local and toll free calling??? airline boarding pass printing notary services??? and fitness center access (which is not a huge place and I didn't use anyway)."
30,Very old rooms no sunlight. Almost at the end of the strip which makes it hard for commuting & exploring strip. Bathroom had water leakage & commode flush was barely operating. Overall not a great place to stay.
30,Used to be such a great hotel but now things are broken and haven’t been maintained not as clean as it used to be…. Can’t believe they tried to charge me $28 when I asked for some boiling water no thanks
50,Stayed in a 2 bedroom panoramic view suite and loved everything from check in to check out. Casino is open and spacious and not cramped...huge plus! Stqff are super friendly and helpful. Lounge was nice and penthouse lounge and staff were amazing!
50,I have stayed all over the place every year. First for conventions and now for Thanksgiving family holidays. We originally changed from our plan because one of my sons thought the Aria would be fun. He was wrong after 3 nights we moved back to Mandalay Bay
50,This place is awesome and perfect in every way possible. Only disappointment was the price for a water bottle in the room's mini-bar 25$ is outrageous for average people like me (not sure about rich people though)...
50,Mandalay Bay staffs are very friendly wherever we go. The variety of restaurants to choose from is great and they also have a food court and great entertainment for kids. The room was very clean when we stayed.
40,Besides the awful smell of smoke all day the rest of the resort was exceptionally amazing! So many amenities and places right within the resort including all the shops and restaurants I would definitely recommend staying here.
50,I stay here when I travel for business Lots of food choices centrally located. Fantastic service from all departments and restaurants!!! The rooms are large and very clean the property is well maintained and have not had any issues.
10,I booked my room through Priceline. Then I did mobile checkin on mgm AP at which time an advance deposit of $202.95 was billed to my credit card. I was assured this deposit would apply to my final bill at check out. However at check out I was told that the advance deposit was actually going to my the cost of my room and that I needed to contact Priceline for refund… this makes no sense. I spent 30 minutes arguing with a male manager on the matter… sadly do not recall his name. He was unreasonable and belligerent. I had to file a dispute with my credit card company and Priceline. Honestly an unacceptable way to treat people and their money!!!
30,Wouldn’t not give me half and half for my coffee cup and coffee pod that they charge 12$. I bought little container of half and half from the deli and was told outright to remove it from the elite king suite I paid for refrigerator.
40,Overrall good stay. Burnt dust smell from hvac and thin walls. Comfy bed and very nice bathroom. Food was delicious. Some restaurants are very spread out and signage could be better. Tram between resorts is very useful.
50,Another great weekend at the Mandalay Bay. Although we didn't win big me and my family had a great time exploring the resort. Did a little shopping gambling and drinking. A Thanksgiving to remember.
10,Poor customer service (the guy who checked me in didn’t ask if we parked a car so when we left I had to run back get in line and activate my room key to open the gate) lady who gave me key looked annoyed water pressure very weak- smokey casino. I will never go back it was such a disappointing experience. I felt the staff is not friendly even the lady on the phone sounded irritated when I asked for someone to come at 10:30 pm to check the water pressure.
30,The room is an average size two queen room. We had a wonderful view of the strip. The beds were comfortable and the staff was very helpful. The only downside was the bathtub being dirty. There were hairs left behind and had to clean this up ourselves. The shower door didn't seal properly and let a draft come in.
50,Rooms were great fresh clean well stocked staff was awesome friendly helpful. Bar tenders were amazing friendly accommodating. The lady that comes around offering massages💆‍♀️ Do it! They are pretty darn good.
30,We stayed in the hotel for Thanksgiving week. We were firstly disappointed to have been reassured by the hotel concierge that the Lazy River would be open only to find it was not. The hotel was perfectly adequate but the staff were not particularly helpful or friendly and the prices were extortionate ($22 for a bottle of water)!
40,Great during summer best pools in vegas! Winter no pools also to far from Center of Strip be ready to walk Lots of Walking! Next to airport You will here the Planes Loud! I here people shower! LOL Pros Clean & Great Staff!
20,I have always been a fan of Mandalay Bay. I'm in the meeting business professionally so I get that hotels are having problems post-pandemic. That said you can't for services you can't deliver well and have people who don't care or with no experience managing key parts of your hotel services ie valet and food service. There are many other places to stay.
50,Really loved the experience excellent rooms (spacious and very clean ) very friendly staff and awesome ambience!    I highly recommend this hotel as its very conveniently located and also got plenty of parking space.. And the best part is that the same room key / card can be used for parking in a lot of other MGM hotels on the strip by paying only once at Mandalay bay for the parking.
40,Our room this time around had a nice strip view however the plumbing was loud the safe/tv didn’t work tile in shower was a bit dirty (maybe just old) in general this room showed it’s age. We’ve stayed here before and didn’t experience any of this maybe it’s just a certain area of the hotel. I would stay again though there are great eating options and the neighboring casinos/restaurants are great/close proximity. Easy to get around.
30,Far from the hustle and bustle of the strip is Mandalay Bay. It has great Pool spa rooms and world class dining. But the rewards program is broken. I’m a platinum member since 2015 and I’m rarely comped for any dining or rooms. I get 20% off spa treatments tu that due to me being a military veteran.
50,Thank you. This was for my husband and I to come see family for the holidays. Mandalay Bay Four Seasons Hotel was the best hotel we have ever stayed at in LasVegas. We will definitely stay here again.
40,It was nice experience again to stay at this hotel. The rooms were clean. Nice casino. Good staff. Check-In is bit problematic given at what time you go in for check-in but if you are Gold or Higher MGM membership then it will be fast compare to regular Check-In.    Nice ambience near casino live music in the night lots of nice restaurant in the Hotel. We tried SeaBreeze Cafe Citizen restaurant which were nice. Friendly staff in the restaurant.    This hotel is at the far end of the strip so bit more time to reach to the strip and have more fun but you can use Tram station to reach near to strip.    The Las Vegas sign is 5 min drive from this hotel and go there in the early morning to click nice photos otherwise there will long waiting line to get the clicks. The place is crowded in the day time as well.    There is nice pizza place across the street next to panda Express & McDonald. The pizza were very good in taste.    The Long Island drink was very good. Not sure from which bar it came out when I was at the table. It was really nice try it if you can.    This trip was FUN again!!
40,The casino smelled like cigarettes which irritated my throat every time I’d walk through. The front desk agent was super nice when we checked in. When I asked him for a higher floor he happily helped out. The room was perfect for me and my boyfriend! I wish I got a chance to go in the pool but it was too cold outside. The convenience store close to the elevator was perfect for whenever a late night snack was needed. The strip is a bit far when you are walking but overall we both enjoyed our first time in vegas here.
50,Outstanding hotel with phenomenal services. I highly recommend this hotel! Totally worth your stay with family and friends with plenty of amenities to do and not to mention the Shark Reef is 🔥 is you having children they’ll love the adventure
40,Well it was another Turkey day in Sin City. For the past couple of years we've been flying to Vagas for a little golfing entertaining and generally contributing to the economy of Vagas. This year we stayed at the MGM Mandalay Bay (MB) Resort and you can guess it was very nice. The staff did a great job rooms were kept in excellent condition. The gaming floor is huge with plenty of slots and crap tables now I was a little surprised to see how little action was at the poker area. I guess that fad has gone.  In the future I'll be running across the street to the ABC for my water and snack in the building just too darn expensive. Additionally I was shocked to find you couldn't buy a newspaper or any magazine at MB this was very disappointing I like to read while enjoying my coffee.
20,I’ve always thought Mandalay Bay was a beautiful hotel and I still do however we just had a chilling experience  ( literally). On our first night there? The heater wasn’t working properly. We called to report the issue and were told a technician would be up shortly. No one ever showed up so I slept with my winter coat and scarf on all night. In addition the shower water would not get hot just barely warm. I normally love to stay at MGM hotels and will continue to do so but I hope this hotel attends more to its maintenance moving forward.
50,We went for my birthday and we had an amazing time. From the check in to all the great games! Had a wonderful time and just had a wonderful birthday celebration. The day of the checkout it was very easy as well no issues at all.
50,Had a great time. Really need to work on cocktail service. Very slow. Spent nearly 2 hours looking for a cocktail; literally followed one to get a drink. Food is good but pricey. Too much smoking.. need to update!
30,We have been coming to MB since it opened in 1999. We have never had a bad experience until now. The sink and bathtub both dripped or made strange sounds throughout the night. My wife did not sleep especially on the night when a loud party next door to us went until 5:30am. The rooms were tired and the decor was outdated. Prices have also gone up so much that we expected better from MGM and Mandalay Bay.
50,Staying at the Mandalay Bay Hotel was great easy check in the staff was friendly and helpful when needed and the room was cleaned really good housekeeping came when called enjoyed the casino and Micheal Jackson experience was nice
40,IF YOU DRIVE and don't spend a lot of time in your room or walking up and down the strip this is a great location. Easy in and out very comfortable beds fast elevators great staff second-best drink service (Aria...) and convenient to other MGM properties on the South end of the stip!
10,Worst experience ever in Vegas.Im visiting Vegas sunce 2002 and I tried many hotels from 1 star to 5 stars and I stayed in poor rooms and villa in Belagio but this experience in Mandalay Bay was horrible..the room wasn't clean  water sink was dirty  the ceiling of the restroom was leaking and ended up with a red spot in the sheet...3 days I asked for a room service but I never got an answer and they came the night before I leave and the girl first refused to change the bed sheet becuase Iam not in the green program.outside the room others people left thier trash .some visitors stayed outside the room for 3 am chatting and blocked the way between rooms
50,Mandalay Bay is a top notch hotel from the cleanliness of the property to the friendly and helpful staff. Amazing food options throughout. The rooms have floor to ceiling windows with amazing views.i would highly recommend staying here. It is one of my favorite places to stay in las Vegas.
50,Lovely hotel and enjoyed Mandalay Shoppes RI Ra Restaurant. Staff reception just so so. Maybe I checked in on a bad day. Easy checkout and fast and plentiful Elevators. Was not feeling well so bedridden most if the stay. Would definitely go back.
10,The title says it all: The place is loud (the room next to us had two crying babies and the walls are paper thin) crowded and the rooms are beginning to fall into disrepair. Most of the pools were closed this visit. Casino Host was dismissive and not helpful. Valet takes 35 minutes to bring your car every time and there is no way to call ahead (you have to use a kiosk). Drink service is incredibly slow. Be prepared to wait in a line for everything — even if you have status with MGM Rewards.
10,I am the MGM gold member but during stay there is no benefit for this high tier of membership. Besides the counter staff forgot to deduct the $100 dining credit issued by AMEX the Hotel Collection booking. Very bad experience!
20,OK we did not have much of expectations for a casino hotel in a town founded by gangsters. Yet we had a decent expectation that to sleep with a comfortable temperature in the room which was not our option as it turned out. After an hour-long struggle with the mandatory ap registration they force on you among a hundred of irrelevant options we have finally found the reception number (and yes they don’t have a stationary phone there and to come down to the reception means the same hour in a wait in a grotesquely long queue) to call for a technician. The idea was not to turn into penguins - it is quite chilly in LV in late November nights. Now when the technician is there he opens the panels and goes “the hvac engine is broken I will have to replace it”. I am like: it is 10 pm “when do you want to do it?” he mumbles that he will still have to do it and leaves with all walls and wires open. He is back in ten minutes when I open the door and telling him that we will not tolerate the repairs at the room he just walks in and starts to poke around in the wall (my girlfriend is in bed all this time just so you know). I am telling him to leave now and he refused literally refused until he attached the cover. The heating still does not work. I am back to the reception (five minutes wait all the time) on the phone with them demanding to change the room totally frustrated by the technician being threatened that they will not change the room if I do not change the tone where I am like: “whaaaat!?”. The lady on the phone changes the tune and give us another room. Now not over bear with me: I am checking if the heating works at the new place and then come back to pick up the belongings. To step aside from this nightmare: we were flying the next day back to NYC very early in the morning so we bought a salmon as you don’t have decent food for breakfast at the airport during the night. This salmon is a thing in this story. So we put the salmon into the fridge (this is a sort of the cheap hotelier tricks where all the bottles are automatically counted towards your account if you even only touch them and there are no cups in the room to make you drink their crap coffee ). Now because we are changing the rooms I am calling the reception again and telling them that we had a bottle of water to charge us on our new room but the lady on the line said it was complimentary for the trouble. Fair enough we are leaving in our pajamas (! Important!) - it is just one floor up and we are dawn tired to think about it at 11 pm before a red -eye flight. Now we see that the fridge with our salmon does not open so we are calling the reception…the lady says that it is blocked as we have been checked out already. Then she managed to open it for us and we took the salmon and left the room in the pursuit of as it turned out new adventures. With our belongings in pajamas we marched down the hall to the elevator which was going up and jumped in with bags and the notorious salmon. We marched into the elevator helplessly sleepy before the already short sleep 11:30 pm at the time and only 4 hours to sleep before the flight. We marched in to just find out that our keys are not good to go to this floor anymore. The people around were supportive and returned us to the same floor we were before as we naively thought that our old room would let us in. Nope. So I am calling the reception which is already showing how tired they are of us suggesting they could send a security officer to take us to the room. When I asked how much time it would take for them to deal with it I got an answer that it would be “as soon as possible” to which when I noted that we were in the elevator lobby in pajamas I got a Longfellow poetry-like comment that it is “apparently still not good enough for us”. It in fact was not as the security officer never appeared and I had to go down find the reception stand in the long queue again to get a key after I spoke to the administrator for a room with “a better view” which we of course did not see as at 1 am with just 3 hours to sleep we had better things to do than to watch the neon ads illuminating the fading glory of the Sin City. So in the morning we decided to cancel our flight and go to California where we will commit to never stay in this soulless ugly junkie cheap reap-off sick place they stole from a sacred place they have not a slightest connection to. P.S. needless to say that they have attempted to charge us $22 for a bottle of flat water they have so kindly called complimentary before. DON’T
40,Did not do the sheets the first day....  Didn't bring me new towels the first day....my iron wasn't working the first day...I called house keeping because I asked them for a new one outside and she said sorry but I can't help you...you need to call downstairs for one....
50,We had a blast while staying kids loved it they loved shark reef aquarium and the pool. We are surprised that the pool are open during winter. They enjoyed and had so much fun we will definitely come back again!
50,Overall i was very pleased with our stay at Mandalay Bay. Me and a friend were there for 4 days and it was wonderful very beautiful hotel and casino. Rooms were very nice for the price and the casino was awesome tons of different games you could never get bored in there.
30,Toilet was gurgling loudly waking me up every morning. Seemed like something from poltergeist. Was waiting for hands to reach out and pull me in. Housekeeping was made aware on 3 occasions but each morning the same noise and water splashed on toilet seat and floor.
10,Rude receptionist. Bad attitude. Temper in handling uncontrolled situation. Rooms ( we booked two) so so. Ordinary. Bed and pillows uncomfortable. Resort fee useless. Only one open pool and not even heated enough my little girl didn’t even lasted long enough to enjoy swimming. Water is too cold. Not worth it. Aside the fact that it’s further from the strip. Choose other hotel instead.
10,Room was not clean and super dated. Furniture was stained. The lights in the restroom kept going out. Called to discuss the lights and they told us just to keep pushing the gfi switch. Nothing was plugged in. Seems like an electrical problem
50,The rooms were exceptional. The shows were great and well coordinated. The whole stay was great and the food was great. The only thing I didn't like was that I requested a late check out and the staff failed to tell me that I would be charged the resort fee. This made me end up paying 100.00 to stay an extra 3 hours. Smh
40,We enjoyed Mandalay! We had a few issued during our stay however: trash in our room upon check-in shower did not drain sinks gurgled a lot TV didn't work. We were in a Stay Well room facing Delano. The hall was quiet and you can't hear the adjoining rooms. The casino does allow smoking so it's hard to walk through to get to self-park without being exposed to the smell. Mandalay has great dining options and a nice casino. The tram to Luxor and Excalibur is nice and free (it is inside). It is a huge hotel so be prepared for a lot of walking!
40,I had the executive suite and was surprised on the lack of mirrors and lighting. I expected much more for the price. The room was clean and spacious so was the bathroom. Wish the mini bar fridge had space for my white wine that I bought.
40,Irish restaurant service was mediocre at best. Wait times at rewards window was horrible. Room was great as well as Rivea.  Would visit again. My choices in restaurants horrible. Either way not all things will be as anticipated. I just keep an open minx
50,Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino is nice celebration good employee to have good information to have nice room and nice to sleep and clean room to enjoy this location and dinnerware wells and swimming pools
50,Excellent service easy check in and check out atmosphere was outstanding from the ground to the interior of the hotel to the rooms everything was CLEAN! Loved the ease of everything in the hotel. Awesome job
50,This is an expensive hotel but we’ll worth the money. It was very clean and the staff was friendly. Restaurant wait time was good if you go early. Easy access to Ubers and taxis. Rooms are clean and spacious.
40,Had a great time at the casino and Vegas with family. Enjoyed the food drinks and gambling. The rooms and view was awesome. Family was very happy enjoyed their room and casino. I will diffidently come back to and stay at Mandalay.
40,Mobile check in and check out was quick and easy. The room itself was spacious and I loved having the big tub available. The room could have used a deep cleaning the shower head was dirty and the bed had something spilled down the side. For a Vegas room the value met the price.
20,First I had a hard time finding the checkin counter we came by thru the lower level and the checkin counter was in the casino level. I had to leave my baby in the lower level and use the escalator (good thing my mom was there to look out for my baby) there's an elevator but you need a keycard. Since I have not checkin yet we weren't able to use the elevator.    Second I got a $75 credit (coz I downgraded my room so my parents room and our room will be in the same building) but I wasn't able to use it because I need to leave asap for work. I asked the front desk if I could use it some other time but they said only good for the day. I work as a RN and I don't have time to stay longer.    3rd when we googled about the pool time it says until 6pm. We were there 4pm but accdg to staff until 5pm only. So my daughter had a short swimming time. I really feel bad for my daughter that's her only wish during our short break. The pool was also very cold I thought it was heated. My daughter got sick.    The checkin and checkout counter has the same line I checked out in the tv but have questions regarding my $75 credit I had to line up and wait long. Eventually my $75 is gone in the air.
40,having a resort fee as a surprise when checking in is terrible. Have this in the cost per room. Parking also $18 per day. It adds up quick so if you are on a budget you may want to look elsewhere. The room was clean staff was great cost was the only issue.
50,Clean hotel with amazing strip views. Great restaurants and bars. Valet is convenient especially if going to the new stadium. Need to arrive early if going to a game otherwise you’re stuck for hours.
50,Loved every portion of my stay at the Mandalay bay. Beautiful location great restaurants. Comfortable beds lovely bathroom with spa tub double sinks great service. Loved my view in my room. Excellent place to stay.
40,I was pleasantly surprised with our room at Mandalay Bay. We stayed 3 nights in a 2 queen bed room. There was so much extra space to move around. The beds were amazing and there were many pillows of varying firmness. There were 2 spacious closets as well as plenty of drawer space. The bathroom is ginormous with large soaking tub and separate walk-in shower a large double vanity. The toilet is in its own room.
50,Beautiful room and the view is just perfect! Experiencing the sunrise was the best thing. Amenities and restaurants are great in the resort. Staff is excellent! Ivan and Alejandro were very pleasant and excellent to help.
10,This hotel is dilapidated and seen better days all the rooms I was in had an issue. Mold in the tub phone not working the tub facet was broken and then placed in a room where the thermostat is not working. Citizens restaurant added extra tip to my bill for just grabbing food. Then my room was never cleaned. His keeping came to my room at 10p.m. While I was sleeping. Woke me up and scared me. This hotel is falling a part and the front desk staff are rude. Julian the front desk manager at the podium looked at me for 10 mins while on the phone then proceeded to take another call and I had to waive over the front desk agent and tell him to call me on my phone due to the phone not working
40,"One of the most reasonable and fair prices on the strip hotel chains (probably because it's the closest to the airport the more southward you approach the strip?). Airport can be heard but it's not bad enough to keep you at night. My only problem is something that isn't isolated in Mandalay bay for for every Hotel-Casino places --- the smell of tobacco. And because it's at the southern-most end of the strip it's far away from the ""fun"" areas of the strip."
50,Have stayed at Mandalay Bay many times and always have a good experience. Very nice gambling floor with plenty of room between tables. Plenty of restaurants. Very nice place to stay. Sports book is also a nice place to watch your favorite team.
50,Great hotel and staff. Great meals very friendly casino staff. Pool was great experience in cabana. My casino host was the best. Food quality great and spa services excellent. Everyone at hotel went out of way to help
50,Even tho the pool with the wave wasn't opened I still had a relaxing time with a drink in hand. Gambling  relaxing and eating. A much needed vacation/mini gateway. Not too expensive just perfect for my budget 👌
30,Hotel price is fair but then they added resort fee parking plus $100 for a pet. So all in it was over twice the listed price. Not to mention I have a Sprinter van so they made me park at the Excalibur. Close to a half mile walk.
50,This was my first time to stay at Mandalay Bay and I was very impressed with the overall look and feel of the hotel; my room was very nice and very clean. My bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was large and well appointed.
30,This was our second visit to this hotel and most likely our last. I’ll start by saying the positive…it is a beautiful hotel. Our major complaint was our room. It was a panoramic two bedroom but the windows (which were only half size) had what appeared to be bars across them. And we paid the same price as floor to ceiling window rooms with no bars. Very disappointed. And don’t even touch the mini bar items bc once lifted a sensor goes off and you get charged. Even if you don’t use it. The room was large but outdated. Just an overall disappointing visit this trip for the price we paid for the room. Either charge less for the lacking panoramic view rooms with the window bars or get rid of them!
50,Stayed for 2 nights at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. Liked the hotel and the service provided. Enjoyed nice clean room freshly renovated. The hotel capacity is pretty large so there are no crowds seen in any area.
10,Said all pools would be open. They were not. When I brought it up on the last day for some sort of compensation they said the pools were open the entire stay. When she said they were open at that moment we went down and checked them all again and they were all closed. Such disbelief I’m still having at the arrogance. We checked every pool every day and only one was open at any point. Lifeguards said they were always closed after November 1st. Which isn’t what the lady on the phone when I called two days before our trip or the front desk or the website said. Our entire reason for staying there was the promise of pools. Staff was nice at the stores and restaurants. Dealers has the least personality of any casino we visited (all but the couple on the north end). Room was dirtier than you’d expect. Had to scrape crud off the shower/tub/toilet. Tv flickered like crazy bed was very comfortable. No mini fridge touch sensitive snacks on the main desk were annoying to avoid.    Embarrassingly rough stay for that price compared to the 5-6 other places we’ve stayed at.
40,We were there for Nevada high school State championship game. Found the room large and supplied with extra towels large mirrors ver clean..staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel though huge was quiet at night and SMOKE FREE
50,Clean room! The strip view from the 24th floor was great! Would recommend mandalay to my other friends! Only thing in the future is that the jacuzzi is hotter even during the winter time. It was Luke warm
40,I took my sons to stay at Mandalay for a quick trip to relax. We loved the hotel the staff and all Mandalay had to offer. We had one issue checking in with our rewards and the staff was quick to resolve it to my satisfaction.
10,I was awaken at 4am by THREE officers telling us our tv was too loud. The volume was not loud at all I was asleep and we were on vacation without our kids so silence was golden to us. Being woke up like that made me very uncomfortable! I would never stay there again
40,A little expensive but beside having to pay to use the mini fridge everything else was exceptional staff was friendly and helpful room was very clean although I wish there were more options for restaurants there is a nice Mexican food place called saliyuanas or something like that had some amazing food.
20,Made reservation for a refurbished room with a LAS Vegas strip view. Got total opposite. The TV wasn’t working and the tech took so long to come had to fix it myself. The room was horrible and the bell man took 30 minutes to bring my bags up.    I’m open to maybe staying at Mandalay Bay again but in the room they promised. Refurbished with a strip view and with a working TV
40,The staff always tells me they have no upgrades but on my Mgm app it says I can get a free upgrade. I paid way too much for the room I stayed in. I can stay at another hotel more centrally located for those same price or cheaper
20,I booked two Rooms and in my room on the 59th floor: the shower was backed up and the water from the shower was tinted slightly opaque/dirty. (I have I booked two Rooms and in my room on the 59th floor: the shower was backed up and the water from the shower was tinted slightly opaque/dirty. (I have photos). I ended up having to utilize another method for the first 2 nights of our stay. Thereafter I requested maintenance. There was also a hair from someone in my bed so that was gross. Plus there was a hole in one of the pillow cases which was really weird considering how much the rooms are. I also booked another room on the same high rise floor and both the television and phone were not in good working order. The television static caused the Tv to be mostly unusable. Essentially it was not working properly and the phone in the room did not work with when attempting to call concierge the front desk or the bell desk upon check-out. So I ended up having to figure out a way to take a heavy 2-man item down. Let’s just say I went up and down a couple times because even after requesting Baggage help from downstairs the first strip I never got help even after 15-20 minutes of waiting… literally the from desk stated someone had to be in the room and still no-one. Although when I went downstairs I requested assistance from a bell man named Dereck who was holding carts hostage. (Which seemed rather odd) but he insisted on being rude instead. ).

I also booked another room on the same high rise floor and both the television and phone were not in good working order.

Lastly and again talking about some of the baggage employees yes…they can be a bit snarky. One particularly stood out beyond the others. This bagged employee was named Dereck. He was unbelievably rude when I requested to utilize one of the 4 baggage transits he had empty and available for use. Also to mention there were an additional 4-5 empty outside the hotel with another employee simply standing with them.    The question is: Would I recommend this Resort? ANSWER: Never. Listen if you want great service and helpful employees (even if it’s just for asking “Where’s the best food”) PARIS RESORT ARIA heck even HILTON RESORT WORLD is better.    If you decide to stay here anyway can’t say I didn’t warn you. Stay Fun Friends!
40,My wife and I visited in December 2021. Our arrival was nice and the staff were great except for one front desk person she was rude over the phone. We blew it off as that person having a bad day because all the other staff were great. We checked in using the VIP lounge so we didn’t have a long line and the staff in the lounge provided exceptional service. We were booked for a 5-night stay. We had some issues with our room. The first room the steam shower didn’t work. Our new room none of the tv’s worked and we were again moved to another room without working tv’s. Staff fixed the tv’s later in the evening. The inconvenience of having three different rooms in two days was major but by the end of our stay the staff made it right.  Our room was clean and had great views of the pool and airport. We had good meals at a few of the restaurants. All in all our stay was good even with the hiccups. We all make mistakes but in the end it’s how you handle fixing the mistake and we feel the staff came through. We were contacted by staff after our stay and they again offered great service. I just booked another stay for December 2022.
50,Front desk was very nice and helpful cleaning staff friendly and courteous location is great and the penthouse was spacious and clean…i rate 5 star in general but i think they need to update the food court or make another one close to the lobby lol
50,We had a real good time the stopwatch real nice clean rooms everything was nice the service on the machines were good Food was good entertainment was good reasonable price we were recommended to our family and friends
50,Service and the hotel made us to have an amazing experience all the people that work there deliver a good service and we enjoy the whole hotel. For sure we going to stay again here on our next visit to Las Vegas
30,My wife and I came here for our anniversary with a reservation.  Pro:  Comfortable Beds  Spacious Bathrooms  Tram out to a less sketchy part of strip    Con:  Very rude front desk  Very limited service on the floor had to keep going to bar to drink.  Paper thin walls to the hallway but great between rooms. Can hear full conversations in the hall from the bath.
30,"We stayed over the weekend at Mandalay Bay and honestly I felt like they were trying to take my money everywhere not just in the casino! When I checked in they charged me twice; they charged an extra $25 just to use the nice gym even though they charge $40/night for a ""resort fee"" that permits one only to use the cramped understaffed and underequipped ""cardio center"" (no towels no water no attendants no view limited equipment). The room was OK - except for the constant ""burping"" noise coming out of the bathroom sink. We turned the water off but that didn't work either. I tried to call for help but no one answers at the front desk (waited 15 minutes on hold twice!) Breakfasts were satisfactory in the main cafe. Honestly I'd find better accommodations in Vegas."
30,Rooms are nice but expensive and no complementary in room amenities like free coffee. The concierge did not have the correct information on the Michael Jackson show including discounts available with a hotel stay and they never honored the discount or even called back. Disappointing.
50,My fiancé and I had a wonderful time. Our stay was absolutely amazing. Great staff friendly people at the front desk. The room and casino was clean. Definitely will be booking out next stay at the Mandalay. Highly recommended
10,Our trip to Mandalay Bay was a first. We generally stay at the New York New York in Las Vegas but wanted to try something new. The trip was terrible from the beginning. The front desk preauthorized $1600 on my credit card for a $125 a night room -- and the charge went through despite the fact that the room was ultimately comped. Pay attention!
50,Was very impressed with all the workers here did not have a negative experience during our stay. We hope to make it back soon and look forward to hitting the casino and getting to know everyone. I hope we get some good perks next time.
20,Wifi was very weak room had toilet that sprayed and the dumb mini-snack bar thing taking up space. Also had to listen to a fridge that I couldn't use according to the sticker informing me that I would be charged $50 per day if I put anything in it. Lighting controls were inconvenient. Pilows were like big blocks of wood.
10,Housekeeping stole property from my room but were dumb enough to leave it in another room luckily I knew the person where they left my property and they returned it to me. Front desk offered me a room credit I didn’t care for that I wanted my property returned.
20,My wife had a business trip we turned into a short vacation. My 3 year old son came with us. Knowing that this is Las Vegas we understand this is not a place for children. However we planned to visit the aquarium museum etc. Our room was at the end of a very long hallway so we had to carry my son every time. Staff was ok but not really friendly. Maybe we’re not the target audience but this was not a good hotel for us. Everything was too spread out everything smelled like weed and cigarette smoke and we ended up going to Target for food/drinks because the “minibar” costs $50 if you touch it…sensors will automatically charge you for even touching the table by the door. Absolutely ridiculous. In our opinion we would choose another hotel. Will not recommend.
10,Paid extra for a room with a view. Only to find out upon check-in that all pools were closed except one. And there is no hot tub. We booked specifically to Enjoy the beach/lazy river - and was not communicated to at booking or prior to check-in that it was closed. The tub had a hair in it the shower had old shampoo on the walls and we weren’t even greeted with a Congratulations’ at check-in. Instead we were warned how sensitive the mini bar area was (sensored tray) and that there is no access to an in-room fridge. If we would have known any of this prior to booking we would have stayed elsewhere. For the price and access to amenities you can easily enjoy more elsewhere. Memorable for all the wrong reasons. Do not celebrate here.
50,Great experience. Good restaurants but be prepared to wait once you get seated the wait staff is small but still good food. We enjoyed the Santana concert and the best part of our vacation. The small venue made it more special.
50,We have stayed here before and always have been very satisfied with our stay. Other than the Wi-Fi not working in our room we had a wonderful time. We look forward to returning and expect it to be just as good as this trip.
50,Took my friend here for her birthday and the whole week went beautifully. From eating at Gallagher’s the first night then Mad Apple cirque du Soleil the next and finishing off with the Tournament of Kings.
40,Great location off the strip a bit nice restaurants and very close to Allegiant Stadium! Purpose of trip was to catch a game. Yet still close enough to strip where we can walk or Uber from place to place.
50,The service was great let us check in early. The room was very clean which is a must. At night we didn’t hear anything or anyone loud walking in the halls which is great. We stayed on the 19th floor with a great view of the strip . The smoke was not bad inside like most other casinos. The only down side was the price of drinks but that’s everywhere you go now of these days. I will continue to stay at the Mandalay Bay!!
50,If you're ok being at the far end of the strip this location is perfect. Rooms are clean we had no issues with noise. There are lots of choices for meals and not all of them are super expensive. I'll be back!
50,Mandalay Bay is a great hotel. The service is excellent and the staff is friendly and helpful. There are plenty of choices for eating and shopping. The location is great and there is a tram to go to other hotels along with connected walkways to the Luxor (next door).
50,Mobile checkin very convenient. Casino was perfect. Staff were very professional. Sleeping rooms were very nice and clean. I loved the huge bathroom! Taxi service was convenient and professional including the staff at the valet area. I would definitely stay here again! Convenient food and shopping!
50,We had an amazing time staying here for Sema and the week after for business. We’ll definitely stay again!! Thanks to the hotel staff who are all awesome! Great drinks and food also! The skull krushers krew will be back!
50,Great service all around. Rooms was comfortable and quiet. Food was outstanding.The bar drinks were great. And staff all around the casino were very helpful. I stayed for a business trip and it was very helpful to find everything needed.
50,We had exceptional experience at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. We love every corner of the hotels. We enjoyed the casinos and the food was super nice. And we are considering another trip soon to the hotel and Las Vegas Nevada
30,The rooms are dated and the price is a bit higher than what we typically paid at the Wynn for previous years for the conference. Issues with key card and late check in also the bathroom light switch off out of the blue and had to reset the GFI to get it to turn back on. Bathroom sink had long strands of hair and one of the pillows had stains on it when i first checked in.
50,Perfect accommodations with staff that are always polite and ready to help. They also have a fantastic program for veterans!!! From the check in to restaurants to table games - always a pleasure and ready to go the extra mile.
50,Very clean rooms n casinos kind if prizey that week but was good experience the roons were bery clesn n casino was clean n didnt smell like cigarettes like other casinos i will definitely come back to this casino and will recommend it
50,The UKG Aspire conference picked a wonderful hotel and property to hold their event.  The Mandalay Bay Resort was clean and the staff friendly and the SPA downstairs was the icing to the awesome cake.
50,One of the best resorts to enjoy a personal vacation. I will definitely return to Mandalay Bay next year. The live band at the casino lounge was on point. A perfect way to unwind and relax. The staff provided great customer service as well. Had a great time!
30,This hotel is huge! It was approximately 3/4 of a mile from our room to the parking deck. It was almost a mile from our room to the food court. It was approximately 1000 steps to and from the elevator to our room which was the last one on the hall. I’m not opposed to walking but just want to warn others that there is a lot of walking involved just getting around in the hotel. Also we were on the 60th floor and our son and his family were on the 25th floor. To get to their room we had to go down to the lobby and change elevators. You have to have a room key card to swipe in the elevator to get to the floor you need. Ours would only work in our elevator so we had to have a card for their elevator as well. It’s a bit of an inconvenience to have to have your card out every time you ride the elevator. The power strip bar beneath the television literally pulled out of the wall when we unplugged something. We had to push it back in every time.
20,you better take several credit cards so that way you can pay for all your meals drinks snacks from the market near the elevators. you will need the extra credit. be careful of the sensors on the snacks/fridge in the room you will be charged. good one las vegas
20,It’s a bit of a party place. The conjoining rooms have no soundproofing whatsoever. Our neighbors partied in their room til 2. We could hear everything they did. Our phone didn’t even work to complain. We had to go down and wait in line to have the desk ask them to stop. Nothing is included. There is a $50 fee to put your water bottle in the fridge and it’s a long trek to the strip to get a reasonably priced anything.
50,Stayed at Mandalay Bay for a work conference. The room was great the view was great. The staff was kind and there was plenty to do within the hotel.  IMO - The only area for improvement would be the amount of smoking in the hotel. It's a casino on the first floor yes but there were guest smoking on our floor as well. All of the smoke made me cough most of my stay.
20,set up for high rollers not average visitors. everything from water to food and drink exorbitant prices. From dawn to dusk extremely loud music throughout casino. Hotel geared toward younger successful patrons
50,great hotel everything you could ever want or need under one roof. Clean and friendly staff. Easy no contact check in. Beautiful hotel at every turn. The reef exhibit is a must see I would definitely stay there again!
50,Check in was so easy can be done at a kiosk so no need to wait in line to register. Our room was very clean and comfortable with quality beds and linens. Plenty of restaurants to choose from at all price ranges. All staff was very friendly and helpful.
30,Spent the weekend in Vegas with about 14 friends 4 of us at Mandalay Bay the rest at Bellagio. We enjoyed the lounges at MB. Was a much better place to gather. Live music was great. Food we had was pretty good also. Loved the Noodle place. Disliked the air quality. Sooo Smokey and the cold pool.
50,Enjoyed our stay at Mandalay Bay. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Restaurants have good quality food. Nice large pool area great gaming casino. Mandalay Bay Luxor and Excalibur are all connected by a tram making it easy to move through the resorts. We would stay here again ! Great casino too.
10,I went for a business trip. I had an issue with my room where the tv didn’t work. I received a call at midnight when I was sleeping but by the time I went to get the phone they had hung up. I traveled for work from the east coast so 12am is 3am my time. Every time I called the front desk there was a minimum hold time of 45-60min  When the maid would come my room seemed dirtier then before she came. I’m not sure if the rags she was using was dirty but there was constantly other types of hair on the sink and in the shower. When I would clean them there was more hair the next day after she came to clean. Then when the maid would come she would take the dirty wash cloths but not replace them and leave the dirty towels. This happened 4 times. I tried to call housekeeping and the front desk and was on hold an hour before giving up and looking for a cart to request wash clothes and towels from.  Last the ceiling and shower had mold. I complained about this and nothing was done. I have asthma and tried to clean the shower with my Lysol wipes but could not get the ceiling. Being in that room exasperated my asthma and I ended up having to go to the doctor.  When I checked out no one asked about my stay or even apologized for the inconvenience these issues caused.  I am extremely disappointed and expected better service.
40,The hotel was great for checkin the room was clean the staff was polite and helpful. The casino area was always neat and clean as well as the convention center. However I must say the food was very mediocre throughout. I dined at Fleur which was a very expensive mediocre restaurant with overcooked steak and cold baked potatoes (twice). Room service breakfast was not great my breakfast potatoes were not cooked through and my yogurt was lumpy like cottage cheese. Service in my room was excellent though. The convention center food was always cold and some dishes were very over salted. I had one cold breakfast with powdered eggs and it was inedible. I had two cold lunches and switched to BBQ Mexicans for my lunches.
50,It was close to the stadiums that we were going to. Food prices in the resort seemed exceptionally high but that’s Vegas. There’s something for everyone here. Room was clean and comfortable. Staff was very friendly and happy to assist.
50,Kelly in the VIP Services went above and beyond to assist me with a printing issue with our documents. She was very patient and solved the problem. I believed Kelly went above and beyond. Kelly gets a A+ and is an asset to the Mandalay Properties.
30,Not as nice as I expected. WiFi didn't work no refrigerator for guest use without a fee. Rewards program was not explained. It looks nice but it's really just a mediocre hotel that cost more than others. Breakfast at Seabreeze was cold and the waitress brought me a new plate because I mentioned it (I asked her not to but she did it anyway) my companions ate cold eggs and toast.
40,The king with strip view room was very nice. However I was surprised that there wasn’t a microwave in the room nor a refrigerator. Those items had to be rented. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful.
30,My bathroom was not clean at all. Shocked at the amount of dust in the corners. Tile floor in the shower appeared to have mold. Most hotels now have shower gel but this one did not.    Towels need to be changed as they were paper thin.
50,Everything from check in to check out was a breeze. Got to stay in a very clean and spacious room with a nice view of allegiant stadium go raiders! All the staff I interacted with had a great attitude. Very nice place to hang out bet on sports table games and slots.
50,It was a nice stay and all the staff were really genuinely nice. Everyone was extremely helpful. The rooms are very modern and updated. The casino you are able to walk around and not get overwhelmed with cigarette smoke.
40,This was a pretty nice resort. The room is beautiful and clean. I stayed for a conference so the elevators did get congested and very slow when the conference was letting out. A lot of dining options that include upscale casual and quick. I did feel their casino ventilation could have been a bit better as it felt smokier than others. I appreciated getting checked in early and the view of the pools was perfect.
50,The hotel was clean enjoyable and relaxing. There were some incidents and semi loud occupants near us but that is something uncontrollable. I at least enjoyed my stay I loved the casino and all restaurants. I was there for business and I would definitely book a room there if I were back for pleasure.
20,Room was dirty not vacuumed and the shower had hair stuck to the wall. Disgusting. No hospitality or understanding from any employees except Dylan the manager when I explained my frustrations. Do better MGM/MANDALAY BAT
50,This resort and conference center are gorgeous! Where else but Las Vegas can you turn down a hall and suddenly be in a 12k seat arena?! However everything is spaced out quite a bit and you should bring some comfy shoes if you’ll be here for a multi day conference!
30,Beware the rooms look nice and all but the walls are paper thin.  Stayed here for a conference and some of the worst conference food I've ever had.  Otherwise the staff was very friendly and the Shark Reef is a hit.
30,Pretty expensive for an average hotel/Casio. Everything was unplugged or not working and the tv kept going out. Pools were all closed and the rooms were average. i tried to get into the spa but it was a 4 hour wait for any massage. I would probably not stay here again unless my Confrence is there again just so I don’t have to travel to other casinos for meetings and events
50,Beautiful view clean room very friendly staff! Highly recommend Mandalay Bay. We really enjoyed dining at Hussongs Cantina.We could not have asked for a better experience. Front desk staff made our trip exceptional.
20,The bed was comfortable but having holes in the pillow cases was not impressive. The lighting was awlful and the room felt like a cave. The minibar prices were worse than NYC and $21 for a $4 bottle of water was just too much.
50,While a few of the staff struggled to do well by far the majority did very well. Julian at the front desk was a gem and is someone whom will keep Mandalay on the top of our list for years to come.    Mandalay has new live music venues in a very upscale and comfortable location. The person who is booking the talent is doing a fantastic job! We are from Music City USA and we were very impressed and thoroughly enjoyed it.    The food here is well above average for a resort. I have noticed complaints about the prices but truly think they are reasonable considering the location and the high quality of food served.    Mandalay has returned once again to the top of our list of places we love in America.
50,I had a wonderful stay at the Mandalay Bay the room was beautiful the amenities were wonderful. I had never stayed at this hotel and was worried due to the distance from the hub of the strip but it wasn't a problem and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the hotel.
20,Arrived at 11pm to check-in to room. Was informed the room was not ready (this was not a last minute booking. This had been booked for months). Check-in service was poor at best. After waiting over an hour for my room to be ready I was informed by another guest they had been waiting for 2 hours for a room. After finally receiving a room I pulled the sheets back on the beds to see multiple long black hairs in the sheets. I’m talking 10 in each bed. Very poor quality service and unacceptable for the price you pay.
30,Upon our arrival both our room and restroom trash bins had previous guests trash. Both sinks were not cleaned properly! Room was dusty and the lighting was not the best. Everything else through the hotel was great.
50,Had an overall excellent experience. Overall location seemed to work well for the number of participants everything needed in one spot excellent support staff clean organized overall a very good experience.
40,I've stayed at the Mandalay several times now as I end up traveling to Vegas to conferences and this is the second actual vacation I've taken to the city. It's been my favorite place to stay in terms of feeling comfortable and safe while traveling. The rooms are clean and quiet and the gaming/ shopping areas fun and engaging.
30,Very disappointed to learn the hotel allowed smoking indoors. I could not avoid this while walking from my room to the conference area. From someone who has allergies and asthma this was far from ideal. In addition I was unaware that the fridge within my room would be off limits for my personal use unless I paid a daily fee.
50,I liked the stay well floor (59) and my room very much. The mattress was a mazing. I even called down to the desk to ask for the brand of the mattress. The lights in the bathroom did not provide enough light. The bathroom felt very dark with the lights on. I would also recommend adding more USB ports by the bed.
30,Overall was mainly disappointed in how much I could hear the guests in the room next to me at night when trying to sleep. Not sure if the sound was traveling through the air vent or what but I could easily make out normal-volume conversations and know what they were saying.
50,The hotel is clean staff friendly and is very convenient to so much. It was a great getaway and enjoyed every moment of it. The shark reef was a great little gem to find within the facility and the rooms are great!
10,Couples trip over Labor Day weekend to see the One show. Arrived at 1AM and the hotel check-in process took an hour with only 5 people ahead of us. We were then told no water until 5am. The water did not return until 11AM actually. Water was out again on Saturday night so again we go to bed with no shower. Took about 3 attempts after we got home to get Delta Vacations to have the hotel give us our money back for two nights of our stay. The hotel instead wanted to offer a complimentary 4-night free stay in the future; I declined. The hotel kept declining stating we were given room credits. Room credits were a joke by the way when you see how highly priced the food is. They claim a water leak but now reading past comments makes me think there is a bigger issue happening with this hotel and they are lying. How can housekeeping clean the rooms with no water (something to think about).    Our tub was covered with hair. Like someone had a haircut and shook their hair cape out over the bathtub.    Do not touch anything on the minibar in the room if you want to avoid a ridiculous charge. Ask for a room facing away from the pool if you don't want to listen to the DJ's music all night. The lower-level elevators are always packed with a line of people waiting. I would suggest asking for a room on floor 50-62 as there seemed to never be a line on that side. If you attend the beach club party beware no large purses and no hand sanitizer is allowed. They will turn you away for both.    Take an uber so you know what price you are paying as the taxis charged us $33 just to go from Mandalay Bay to the old Vegas.    PROS - Beautiful hotel. Well-kept grounds. The casino was never busy. The MJ One concert was AWESOME!    CONS - The hotel is located far from nightlife so unless you are a walker you should book elsewhere. The minibar is a ripoff; even a bump and you are charged. Food is HIGH in this hotel. $23 for a sandwich water and chips.    TIP - It is your hard-earned money that you are giving to these hotels. If you are not getting what you paid for then do not stop until you get your money back. Robert at the front desk told me this hotel does not do room refunds but they do and they did. We paid over $200/night for this room and expected to be able to shower wash hands and use the toilet at the very least and they could not provide that. If you find yourself in the same situation get your money back. Even if it takes disputing with your credit card company which was going to be my next step.    ENJOY VEGAS! Just maybe not at this hotel.
10,Stayed here over Labor Day weekend with my wife. She wanted to see the MJ One show and it was my first time to Vegas. We booked through Delta Vacations and arrived at 1AM Friday morning to be told the water is off until 5AM. A room credit of was given and off to the room we go. We wake at 8AM to no water. Front desk issues another room credit and says water will be on at 9AM. The water did not return until 11AM. Being we could not shower the night before or that morning we waited around for water to return. Again Saturday night after our 8pm MJ show the water is off AGAIN! We were so pooped that we AGAIN went to bed unshowered. When checking with front desk the clerk said best he could do was refund of resort fee. We did not fight on spot but when we got home we contacted the hotel first and they decline refund of two of our nights. Then we contacted BBB and again hotel decline. Then we went to Delta Vacations and hotel declined again saying we got room credits and refund of daily resort fee. After trying one more time with Delta vacations and explaining the resort fee has nothing to do with lack of running water and the sanitary issues with lack of water results in. We paid over $200/night for that room and we should have had water. We were finally refunded for two nights of our stay. I would never stay at this hotel nor recommend it to anyone else. If this happened to you fight for your money back.
50,So nice to see all the people out again the hotel lobby was vibrant. The food at the restaurants on lobby level were excellent. We especially enjoyed the convenience of their digital check in via the MGM app. Will be back again !
50,I loved staying here. It made the Vegas experience accessible to me. The hotel was super nice with incredible views awesome pools and kind staff. The conference space was awesome and big! Stores that didn't make me feel like I needed to have an oil well or be a Prince to be able to shop and eat. It was a great place that I would take my family.
40,Very clean hotel and wonderful rooms. Far from main hotels on the strip. Doing choices were not the best and/or too spread out. Overall the hotel was wonderful and a good place to stay for a business conference.
50,Beautiful hotel casino and restaurants. The staff from the minute you walk in are accommodating helpful and so polite. You feel like a true V.I.P.  Restaurants not only had exceptional wait staff but excellent food!
30,"I paid extra for a room with a view on a high floor. I got a subpar view with a leaky faucet that didn't get fixed in time and a toilet that kept making ""bubbling"" noises as if it was going to explode. Multiple times I ran to the toilet because I thought it was about to leak water everywhere. Maintenance never showed up!"
50,Hotel rooms are amazing. There are plenty of places to eat plenty of entertainment and gaming. If you want to move to another casino there is the tram which will take you either to the Luxor right next door or to the Excalibur. So extra convenient.
50,Super nice staff clean room and hotel. Went to an event at the House of Blues and the staff there was amazing as well. We will definitely be coming back as often as we can in the future. Thank you for the lovely stay.
40,"The facilities inside are good . but for the love of god bring some water and snacks to your room from outside. I have never seen a hotel not even provide complimentary water or coffee much less a ""4 star hotel""  kind of pathetic."
50,I really liked our stay at the Mandalay Bay. The pool area was wonderful! The room view we had was great. We were upgraded the same day. The hotel was very beautiful and clean. It was a very classy establishment!
10,Need remodeling especially shower 🚿 not in off water  Also 22$ for 1 room water???    Restaurant  I order a steak it was horrible  Trust me probably I hope have a better food than your restaurant    You need to look those things
10,Not the same Mandalay Bay I was expecting as in the past. This used to be a really fun and relaxing casino- now it feels more like I’m staying at a cheap chain in Times Sq. Too stressful. Too much catering to children. Those who want to come and spend money are treated like an inconvenience. Will happily go elsewhere next time!
50,It is obvious that the staff makes every effort to provide the best service possible. The property is always immaculate. If you enjoy sushi and Japanese cuisine KUMI is a great choice. I highly recommend the wagyu gyoza.
40,Late season golf trip to Las Vegas Bali Hai Golf was amazing but the weather was a little cooler than I hoped. Stayed at the Mandalay Bay and had a great time. Casino floor was fun and spread out. Didn’t seem over crowded but busy. Lots to do.
50,Wonderful property that is well maintained and gives you the perfect escape from the craziness of the center of the strip. Boarder Grill is a must. Really enjoyed the casino floor and all the different games. Property doesn’t smell like an astray which is a huge plus.
40,Very nice hotel with helpful staff. Our room was in excellent condition and very well appointed. All the restaurants we ate at on property had great food. I especially recommend Kumi. The casino was nice and the staff were helpful.
50,For our honeymoon 13 years ago we stayed at Mandalay Bay and we wanted to stay there this year for our anniversary. As entering the Mandalay Bay the hotel is super clean. We checked in the VIP lounge and the staff there were welcoming and professional. We stayed in the stay well floor in a wonderful corner Suite. The room was clean and bed was super comfortable. The tub was HUGE! My husband and I really enjoyed our stay and I would definitely go back!
50,Went with a group of guys for a Bachelor Party trip and had never stayed in Vegas before. Bellagio and Venetian were both $500 or more a night we weren't planning on spending much time in the room so we wanted a more reasonable place but still on the strip. Rooms were great for the price and then some property was nicer than I expected too!
30,Mandalay Bay was convenient for my event. My bathroom smelled like urine. The mattress was sunken in. I guess I expected more for the cost of the room. My dealers were not friendly. Check in through thru the app didn't work. Overall the stay was mediocre.
10,I can’t stress enough how horrible the service at your hotel was. This was my first trip to Vegas ever and I still can’t believe how I was treated.  The hotel was beautiful I enjoyed the pool spa and the food was great. The casino was exciting and I won a grand jackpot. Everything about the hotel is 5 stars but what really ruined my experience is the staff I dealt with. When I hit the jackpot which was quite a big win I went to MGM rewards to check the status of my points and was told it won’t reflect right away and to give it 24hrs. I waited two days and went back - nothing. The night before me and my boyfriend checked out we went to speak with a host to see if we can have anything comped at all based on my play. I spoke with a host Katherine who was kind enough to comp our one room and everything charged on it that day but was told there’s no record of me hitting a jackpot at all. The room was comped based on my play but not the jackpot. I was told that if the jackpot was on my card our entire stay would’ve been comped. Mind you taxes were taken out and everything right away so there should be a record of my winnings that day. I was then sent to a slots manager to look into it. That’s when the host gave me her number and told me to text her once it’s all fixed and she will comp the last room as well. The slots manager I was sent to I believe her name was Patricia she introduced herself as Patty told me she only sees around $2000 of play she does see my W2 showing my win but no points were added to my players card from the jackpot. She then said she will reach out to MGM rewards and will have it added manually and took my phone number stating she will call me once it’s all taken care of. I showed pictures of the slot machine I played on where you can clearly see my card was in the machine when I played so it wasn’t due to a fault of my own…I really enjoyed my stay there and didn’t want to give anyone a hard time and was patient up until I realized nobody was actually taking me seriously rather just wasting my time. After a while I noticed I can’t find my players card so I went to MGM rewards to get a new one and asked if there was any update on my points. The girl at the window had no idea what I was talking about….she called over ANOTHER slot manager who THANKFULLY added my play manually right away or at least she said she did. She even said she’s surprised that nobody had taken care of it already. I text the host letting her know it’s all taken care of now jackpot points are added and that anything else she can do for us will be greatly appreciated and I thanked her. - no response. We went to the VIP room to speak with a host again before checkout but they weren’t open and we left. At checkout we asked to leave a note for the host - They couldn’t do it. I called from the airport - No response. Thursday I called the same host again - got sent to voicemail. I called the office and was transferred to a different host who not only didn’t help at all but gave me attitude on the phone for basically calling and acted like I was disturbing him. I believe his name was Marciano. He was cutting me off as I was talking saying things like “who gave you thing number?” “How did you even get this number?” I explained that I was transferred here and I didn’t directly call him to which he responded with “Well I’m not even supposed to be in the office today so..” ?!?! That’s when I started getting extremely annoyed with the entire situation. He asked me which host I spoke with and gave him her name. He said he will send her an email by the end of the day and make sure she reaches out to me. Needless to say nothing came out of that phone call and nobody reached out to me. I made an account with MGM rewards the same day so I can at least download my win/loss W2 statement. The website shows I have no play whatsoever. My rewards number on my players card shows a completely different number from what my online account does as well. I wrote an email to MGM rewards asking for help and attached screenshots of the different numbers - no response. I did not only win money in their hotel I also lost and there’s no record of that whatsoever. I’m beyond shocked of how everyone handled my situation. How I was offered help and as soon as I walked out of the door I was legitimately ignored. And don’t get me wrong it’s not at all about getting my last night at the hotel comped. Had that not even been mentioned I would’ve just been plenty happy with the one comped room we received. But to tell me how had my jackpot been on my card the entire stay would’ve been free which by the way was completely their fault that it wasn’t on the card to begin with just to have me chase people around hoping they actually do their job and fix whatever error occurred on their end and all of that just to be disrespected and ignored like I wasn’t a guest at that hotel is just beyond me. I tried to be as patient as possible I didn’t want to cause any issues rather just give them an opportunity to fix what they’ve caused and not give them a hard time about it. I’ve worked in customer service for years - I get it! But unfortunately I got pushed to my limits. I will be forced to pay additional taxes in NYS due to not having my win/loss statement PROPERLY entered. That’s just the financial part of it….the customer service was horrendous to say the least. I don’t believe I will ever stay at Mandalay Bay ever again. The room was in my boyfriends name(Kyle Johnson. Room# 8312) and I was an authorized party on it. While this may be my first time in Vegas my boyfriend goes every year. His parents who we were also with are part or MGM rewards and go to Vegas at least twice a year. You would think that since they know we’ll come back they would at least try to have us go back to their hotel instead of a different one right? Regardless…this is not at all how you treat your guests. Horrible. Never again! I honestly still can’t believe this all happened.  I’m expecting that at least my points will get added to my MGM rewards account so I can download my win/loss W2 statement. I gave back almost half of what I won in your casino. I don’t care about the room from our last night being comped I will never be staying at this casino again. Just fix my rewards.
40,It is a great option to stay in Vegas. All instalations are very convenient specially if you are planning to go to the Allegian Stadium. The hotel has many dinning options. The casino has a lot space between all slots.
50,Highly recommend MB for a Vegas trip. The hotel is super clean no smoke smell at all (actually smells like the beach) and is never over-crowded. We brought our 5 year old son for the weekend and he had a blast checking out the Shark Reef.    Highly recommend!
20,There was no value for the money spent for this hotel room in my opinion.  A dripping water tap in the bathroom told me more about the hotel that any review could possibly be a difference. They had a small note that was prompting water conservation and yet the water was dripping just inches away.
40,It was hard to get coffee and a quick breakfast Bar area lacked efficient service. Nevertheless Mandalay Bat is a good value with easy access to shows and live entertainment. Comfortable beds and spacious rooms at this hotel.
50,Just amazing experience from check in to lobby to housekeeping I was well pleased and just felt so cozy and I never thought it was affordable due to the looks and all but I am happy I got to experience this hotel and felt like very classy
10,First room we checked into the ac unit was not working. Second room we checked into had a toilet clogging problem. AC made an awful loud noise in the middle of the night. Phone to call down to front desk didn’t work properly.
50,I would stay again for 1-3 nights. Anything longer I would stay more in the middle of the strip. It was a very good value. Everyone was friendly and love that there is a tub and not just a shower.n Wee had a strip view which gave a different perspective than what we have see before.
10,We stayed at the Mandalay Bay the first day the sheets were dirty we asked housekeeper why they never put fresh sheets before we checked in they couldn’t answer. Got charged for the housekeeper moving the items in the mini bar the manager said she removed charges but my bill says otherwise
30,When I go to a hotel I expect to pay for things like mini bar items room service etc but ya'll these guys charge $12 for a cup of coffee. A cup of coffee in your room from the tiny little coffee maker. TWELVE DOLLARS!!!!!You believe that SH*T???
30,Doesn’t include the most basic of necessities such as a fridge or microwave. We were forced to spend more money unnecessarily on food. Promised a microwave never happened. Also doesn’t offer late check out.
50,This resort is as great as the other big MGM Resorts except the location. I feel that it’s not as close to the center of Vegas but more like at the perimeter of Vegas. Still not a deal breaker but instead one of my top places to stay at.
50,Oct 2022 - room was clean and bright. Staff was friendly and available. Small lines for check in/out. With the free tram available to nearly hotels we could move around relatively easy. Definitely would stay here again.
50,The property is massive clean and well staffed. The room was nice and the beach pool is a great place to hang out. It's connected to the casino as well as a couple restaurants and a convenience store.
50,Love it here at MB. Super easy check in digital keys all worked close to freeway and super easy in and out of property. Always something going on here love the sports book. My go to place you won’t be disappointed!
10,Casino staff ignores me during my stay there! Ask for drinks but they just walk away like I didn’t ask for it! And the other one just told me I gotta need to play but I was already playing and holding my money or ticket from the slots!!
20,"Booked online. Had an error in my booking. They refused to comp the price I paid (didn't hurt to ask). I had to rebook the room on my phone they said they couldn't do it at the desk. Huh? Paid close to $400 for a room that had a dirty bath tub white ""powder"" on the carpet in weird areas and no ""do not disturb"" sign. Plus this MEGA million dollar (Maybe billion) maker CHARGES FOR WATER AND COFFEE!! Who does that??? $10 for a 20 oz Fuji... ridiculous."
50,Compared to other hotels on the strip Mandalay Bay is particularly clean. The air is well circulated. Smells nice! The place is beautiful and the pool area with beach/sand is awesome! Good people too!
50,Food Shopping and Entertainment all in one location. We loved our stay! Loved it! From the time we checked the staff was amazing to the time we checked out they have taxis waiting and ready to take you back to the airport. It was great!
50,My stay was determined by the event being held at the Mandalay Bay and I was ever so pleased I booked a room right away! The event was excellent and the long working days were crowned by enjoying a spacious and comfy room with a luxurious bath (super fast fill and a deep tub). What a way to end the day and get ready for the next!
50,It’s some thing about the smell of suntan lotion when you walk through the front door… It makes you think you’ve stepped onto an island in the Keys or the Bahamas. I love the atmosphere and the pool area is awesome!
30,It's a beautiful hotel but the service seems to have gone downhill since MGM took over. Just a few complaints... At times there was no hot water. Not cold water coming out of the tap no water at all. Water pressure was often too low to shower.  We had a horrible experience at the Foundation Room. My husband's shrimp cocktail and my salad both had hair in them. Nothing was done to remedy this. Our complimentary ice cream which most tables received was brought to us before we finished our meal so it melted before we ate it. Our waiter was slovenly and complained continually about his knees.  And we spent hours in the casino yet we never heard any jackpots being hit. That was kind of odd.
30,No complimentary coffee in room expensive just to use refrigerator in room. Housekeeping didn't vacuumed my room during my stay. I asked for clean sheets and didn't get any. Didn't always leave enough towels for bath or hand towels. Noise in the wall like a critter gnawing. Housekeeping didn't close my door all the way after they straightened my room one day.
40,Everything was great except there isn’t complimentary coffee available in the rooms nor is there a refrigerator. Everything in the hotel convenience store was very expensive.  All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. We especially enjoyed the pool area.
40,Stay in the Panoramic suite for my 50th.  It has a great view of the strip was cleaned to perfection daily and the staff were really friendly. The parking allowed me to park at any MGM property. The casino floor is roomy and you don’t have to squeeze between people to get to tables.  Planning on coming back again.
30,Came for a conference. Nothing set this hotel apart from anyone else except distance from outside amenities and other parts of the strip. Lots of public transportation necessary to do anything outside of the casino.
40,Room was clean casino was exciting people were pleasant. The corridor between Mandalay Bay and Luxor has plenty of restaurants and shops to choose. I was there during a Raiders home game so the casino was packed making it hard to get even a coffee in the morning.
50,Fun and exciting . Bonding with friends.Food are delicious and lots of slot games to play. Staffs are friendly and approachable.. Nice hotel. Will definitely come back. Rooms are clean. Easy access to shops and other casino .
40,It was nice. I was there for a concert. I just wished it was more closer to the action. Wished the team ride went further as well. Overall everything was good I would recommend it to others. Thank ux
50,I love the location of Mandalay Bay at the South end of the Strip. It is a short walk over the bridge to go to any Allegiant events so that saves you a lot of money in parking directly at the stadium.
50,We went to Las Vegas to celebrate sons 30 birthday. we had great food and drinks. The Oeather was great 68 to 72 for five days. the airport was less busy . I would recommend a october vacation to anyone who enjoys walking the strip.
50,One of the most relaxing and smoother stay I have had in Las Vegas from the beginning of stay I love the practicality and availability you just check in before getting to the property. After a long flight is amazing to just to in and relax.
50,The Mandalay Bay is beautiful and clean. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The service was excellent. It has a convenient tram to connecting hotels as well as a bus stop right in front. We enjoyed our stay.
50,We were extremely happy with our entire experience at the Mandalay Bay. From the online check-in to the on-site guest parking and the room stay we were blown away. We will definitely be staying at the Mandalay during our next trip to Vegas.
50,There were 5 couples celebrating the 20th wedding anniversary of one of the couples. Our stay at Mandalay Bay was exceptional. The food entertainment and overall energy was amazing! Would definitely return.
30,If you plan to work out during your stay prepare to shell out some cash...unless you are a man. This facility charges $25/day to access their gym that has free weights and weight machines in addition to what you are already paying to stay there. That said I had several male friends that stayed at the property and weren't charged for the gym while I was stopped by spa staff and was required to pay. Not a good look! This property while it has a lot is pretty far from more fun spots on the strip. The staff at the hotel was great but the hotel does not allow them to share their Venmo or Cash App for gratuity. So if you wish to thank the wonderful staff better bring cash. Overall meh.
50,I always stay at Mandalay Bay it is extremely comfortable. The staff is alway willing to help if needed. It is convenient to the strip without all the noise. The pool and aquarium are great for the family.
40,Very nice Casino. It's on the far end of the Strip and a bit isolated. It's a very large property but is really nice and has excellent pools and restaurants. The House of Blues is a great place to have drink and listen to good music from live bands.
50,There is never a dull moment at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino. The stay was extremely comfortable exciting and entertaining. I really did not have to leave the hotel for anything other than to explore other hotels and places.
10,Upon arrival room was dirty and hair on the linen waited over 4 hours for housekeeping to come clean the room also room had a foul smell. Very noisy from the guest next door several calls had to be made for security to come up.
40,Used MGM rewards to book 4 night comp/100 free play / 50 F&B. Stayed 5 nights total so paid one night. Also had Myvegas rewards during the time including another 300$ in freeplay Buy1-get1 at excal/luxor buffet. Didnt stay in room much but in room jacuzzi was nice after walking the strip so much. Didnt know there was a tram to excalibur on first day MAKE SURE TO UTILIZE THIS! Some of the signage in general made it difficult to find where things were. (How to get to luxor from there etc).
50,This was my 2nd trip to Vegas. I was told to stay at Mandalay Bay because of the pools. That advice was not wrong. We met the best people at the pool and hung out with some of them all weekend. Our room was incredible with an absolutely beautiful view. I will definitely be coming back.
10,I reserved a king room months in advance. When my wife and I (two women) checked in the front desk agent went as far as to hand us the keys before informed us that they do not have any king rooms available so he put us in a queen room. We do not even sleep in a queen bed at home so I am not going to pay money to sleep in a queen bed when I reserved and paid for a king. The front desk agent said they only reserve rooms not bed types even though I reserved a bed type.    I spoke with the manager who just happened to find one king room that just became available within the 5 minute timeframe of the front desk agent telling us there weren’t kings available. Apparently rooms become available at 11pm at this hotel. I travel weekly for work and stay in everything from Courtyards to Four Seasons and have never heard of a hotel being able to give you any room they want no matter what you reserved and paid for.    I believe they were low on king rooms but were keeping the king rooms for “couples”. Apparently they did not think two women were capable of being a couple. Sounds a little homophobic to me.    The rest of the hotel was also a disaster. They charge you for everything. We stayed at this hotel because our niece and nephew were also staying here and wanted to use the water park. Unfortunately you have to pay $30 for a tube to even use the water park. They also charge you $100 to borrow an umbrella.    The fees don’t stop there even with a resort fee you already paid. You have to pay for self parking in-room coffee has a fee plus it’s $50 to use an in room refrigerator.    The only thing included in the resort fee is Wi-Fi and room cleaning but the Wi-Fi in my room did not even work and they only cleaned our room once over a 3 night stay. We requested clean towels as well and those never showed up.    Seriously this is probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The customer service is just as terrible as the extra fees.
30,Beautiful hotel and casino until there's a problem where the different cashier Rewards program Lobby slot floor people they keep sending you to another place if you have any issues it's a good system for making people give up they have a they don't care attitude about their customers just keep sending you around and around until you give up
50,I was Abe to attend Mandalay Bay for the first time last month with my spouse the staff were so friendly and the rooms were so clean I would definitely recommend this resort to friends and family!!
40,Hotel and room were clean. Did have issues with no wash towels bummer when you’re in a rush to shower. Also a few electrical outlets didn’t work. Not a fan of being charged a resort fee for no additional amenities. Everything in the room - snacks and drinks came with an extra fee even coffee isn’t free! But room is nice size and seemed quiet. The pool area is huge but again you can’t get an umbrella without paying more. Self parking is an additional daily cost. Overall great but I don’t like all the extra fees. The resort fee should cover these items.
10,Nothing is complimentary at this hotel... No refridgerator in the room unless willing to pay extra bathroom doors in the room did not work not in a good part of town-witnessed a robbery of a convenient store across the street from the mandalay bay. There isn't even coffee and a coffee maker in the room
40,I was in town for the IFEB conference held at the Mandalay Convention Center. I found that the hotel and casino were very professional and clean. I believe that I will stay here again if the opportunity presents itself.
30,Security seemed pretty non-existent. My phone was stolen I was offered no assistance from security and no help from the staff. A machine I was playing malfunctioned and the staff again showed no interest in resolving it or making sure it got fixed. Not what I would expect in any way from a 4 star hotel (which they claim to be).
30,First of all the Walls are paper thin. Neighbors had sex the ENTIRE trip so no sleep for Me. I had to record the sound through my wall because nobody would believe how loud they were. I slept with my music blasting the entire trip just to mask the sounds. I bang on their wall they bang on mine.
30,The room was very clean and neat The next day we had to ask for towels and toilet paper. They did not clean rooms daily. I was there for 4 days. The maids turn door card to say do not disturb so They would not have clean. We never would have said don't clean the room.
10,Being excited to go to Vegas for your honeymoon just to be spoken to and belittled by the front checking staff. Lessons learned is don’t ask them questions. They have no answers they’re rude and they’re nasty. It was my honeymoon and I didn’t need Lessons learned is don’t ask them questions they have no answers. They’re rude and they’re nasty. It was my honeymoon and I didn’t need them to make it special but I also didn’t need them to give me a hard time.
20,Hotel was ok the only problem is our room was knocked several times in the morning while we were sleeping even when the DND Sign was on. We checked in 12am because we came from the concert so we were granted for a 12noon checked out. But we were knocked around 11am from a housekeeping asking if we’re checking out which disturbed our sleep. DND sign should be taken seriously. We usually stay in Aria and tried giving a shot here in Mandalay Bay. I guess privacy isn’t a top priority here.
50,Great pool area. Clean hotel with great service and friendly staff. Big shout-out to Rolando one of the bartenders at Borders in Mandalay Bay Resort - he was friendly professional and quick service. he even remembered my drink (Casamigos Repasado on the rocks) the next night! Highly recommend this resort. Think about bringing your own bottle to help defray the cost of drinks in the resort!
10,I am writing to inform you of the poor service I received and the below subpar quality of the bathroom at the Mandalay Bay Resort this past weekend. The shower was filled with mold in every single crack and crevice. I have attached pictures. The mold and shower crud were black in color and the shower looked like it had never been cleaned since the hotel first opened. The hotel room walls were as thin as paper. I was on the 4th floor in Room 214. The neighbors in Room 216 yelled screamed and cursed from the time I checked in after 2pm until I left for a concert at 8pm. I returned to my room at 1AM and the same sounds continued. I attempted to sleep but could not. Finally at 2:30AM I called downstairs and asked if something could be done. The gentleman who answered the phone stated they would send security. Another hour passed with no relief. I called again and the same gentleman transferred me to the front desk where I spoke with Amanda. I advised her of my room number and the neighbor’s room number that was keeping up all the noise. I also told her that it was my second time calling within an hour. She told me that she would send security. Fifteen minutes later things seemed to have quieted down so I assumed security had called or come and spoken to my neighbors. A minute later I found out how wrong I was. There was heavy knocking but it was at MY door. I got a little scared but answered anyway with my husband behind me. There were four uniformed security guards. One loudly asked me if I had called about a disturbance in the room next door. I said yes that I had called twice about it. He said very rudely that there was no noise and that he had been outside for a few minutes. I got a little angry at that point and I told him “Well stick around!” and I closed the door in his face. Five minutes later my next-door neighbor yelled out “Oh you wanna call security on me you fu**ing a**hole??!!!! I’ll see you’re a** very soon!!!!” She continued ranting and raving for a few more minutes. My husband and I tried to sleep but I must admit I was really scared at that point and I was too afraid to call security again. I couldn’t believe they would be so loud and make it obvious that I called them for help!!!! I feel like they put my husband and I in extreme danger by exposing that we were the ones to call them. I cannot believe they did not make the complaint anonymous and had the audacity to knock on my door to confirm that I had called them all while my neighboI am writing to inform you of the poor service I received and the below subpar quality of the bathroom at the Mandalay Bay Resort this past weekend.

Then to add more fuel to the fire my hotel room phone rang and it was Amanda from the front desk again accusatorily asking me if I told the security officers that I did NOT call to complain. She stated the main guard that I spoke with told her that after asking I stated that I did NOT call security. I told her that I told him that I had called not once but TWICE and that I never stated I didn’t call to complain although if I had known I would be exposed and then threatened by the people I complained about I would’ve never called them!!!! She told me she was going to call security back and hung up on me. By then it was 4:15AM I was even more afraid that security was going to come back and ask my neighbor why they were making threats through the wall. Luckily (I guess) they never came. My husband and I stayed awake worrying until sunrise and then began to pack our things to leave. We had decided at the concert the night before that we were going to inquire if we could stay another night but after all the negative happenings from the shower to the security events we quickly dressed opened our door as quietly as possible and then walked briskly with our belongings to the elevator while looking over our shoulders. I don’t think our breathing returned to normal until we loaded our car got in drove out of the parking structure and checked out from our phone. We then drove down to the Paris Hotel and casino got a beautiful but most importantly clean and quiet room for the same price paid for early check in and gambled and enjoyed ourselves safely cleanly and freely like we thought we were going to be able to do at Mandalay Bay. Needless to say I will never ever stay there Luxor or Excalibur or any MGM properties for that manner. If that is your usual security policy while handling complaints I strongly suggest you adopt a new one. Your staff played a very dangerous game with your patron’s safety this weekend and I pray it never happens to anyone else again. Also the showers are truly a safety hazard. Someone can get really sick behind that. For the cost of your rooms I expected much better upkeep and to feel safe. But then again this is all my fault for booking with this corporation again after staying at Excalibur the summer of 2021 where the shower backed up nobody came to fix it after I called and begged repeatedly and my husband had to go to Home Depot and purchase a plunger and fix the problem himself!!!! These hotels are just shameful and should be condemned!!! I am SO disgusted and disappointed! I am just glad my children were not with us this go round or things would’ve turned out quite differently because after all the threats I definitely would have bypassed your security and called Las Vegas Metro Police Department. I was not going to ask but after re-reading this entire letter I wrote I would like a full refund. Not a comp not a hotel voucher for an MGM Property but a full refund. There is no reason why I should have to pay to stay in a room that I couldn’t shower in couldn’t sleep in and definitely didn’t feel safe in. I might as well had slept on the strip!
40,The hotel is well maintained but our room was missing the final details. No tissues no washcloths and a sink drain that didn’t work. And yet no one asked about our stay at checkout. Team members we passed in the halls were friendly. The essentials store doesn’t post prices.
50,Mandalay Bay is beautiful spacious and clean. I like that it's at the end of the strip where there's not as much people congestion and traffic. The multi-area is absolutely fabulous. There are about five different pools and a few different hot tubs. There's also convenient dining located out there too. The Sandy area near the wave pool is fun. It almost feels like you're in a Caribbean Island somewhere.
50,My husband and I (30s) stayed here with his parents (60s) and we all had a great experience! The rooms are quiet clean comfortable and well-kept. There is NOT a mini-fridge just a $$$mini-bar. We went to CVS or Walgreens to get snacks and water at a reasonable price. Bring a rubber door stop to prop open the toilet cubby to air it out.    The property is at the far end of the Strip but with a tram to Excalibur the Deuce and ample supply of taxis we didn't feel that far from the action! There are a few close options for a cheaper breakfast across the street.    The Casino was smoky as expected but kept clean and the cocktail servers were prompt to offer drinks. The Casino was also easy to navigate. The Beach is great and a relaxing place to hang out in the sun.    The staff we encountered were nearly all extremely friendly and helpful! One notable standout--we had a red eye home and entered the taxi queue just after the MJ show let out. The Bellhop/Taxi Attendant quickly recognized our party of 4 with luggage and pulled us out of line and into a taxi! Wonderful attention to detail!    Stay here. You won't regret it.
50,The property is well maintained and offers a great choice when dining and entertainment options. Check in is easy with the app and is is a great value when compared to other options on the strip. Will definitely stay again.
40,Upon booking we didn't realize how far away we were from the center of the LV strip. We felt like the overall weekend higher than average hotel prices are not a reasonable value. Hotel staff were friendly. Room had less than desirable views and could use a deep clean. Bed was comfy. Pools are awesome!
50,Everything was great! Rooms were spotless quiet everything you’d hope for. However I would recommend grabbing the physical keycard at the quick kiosk. Makes elevators and room check in much easier.
50,Hotel is beautiful. Room was big and clean. The amenities were awesome. Loved the pool and the lazy river. Excellent restaurants. Housekeeping was top notch. Would definitely stay and again. Highly recommend
20,Tobacco smoke filed the casino. After wading through the smoke 5 times going to and from my room my eyes watered and my throat was sore. The bathroom door was broken and made it inoperable. I am not going back to Las Vegas and its casinos.
50,Mandalay Bay and the Mandalay Bay Convention Center showed great hospitality! Vegas owes me nothing! I stayed from October 22 to October 26th and find experience a single problem. Mandalay Bay is definitely on my radar for when I return to Vegas!
50,Great service and a great casino. Restaurants were all top notch. The front desk was amazing as well as the entire staff all around. Cannot wait to come back again. Mandalay Bay is the place to stay when coming to Vegas!
30,This hotel is tired the staff are only in it for the tips and the system are not efficient enough eg. automatic check-in to deal with the volume. Everything is extra $$. I attended a conference and that is why I stayed there but wouldn't stay there again. The restaurant while lots of choices are very expensive and from the moment we arrived the service we received was 2 out of 5. Honestly not very impressed.
20,You are not safe from the birds at any outdoor venue especially when you are eating. The birds land on your table and are walking\flying all around you at the tables or the lounge chairs by the pool.
10,We visited the House of Blues earlier this week with friends from out of town. We had to pay $18 to park on a Saturday night (we are locals). The food was so-so the drinks were WAY overpriced and the concert security staff hassled us endlessly for having 1 person with a seat elsewhere hanging with us in a different section that was only 2/3 full.
50,Came in for less than 24-hours to attend a business conference. Mandalay Bay had an incredibly easy check-in process allowing me to use my phone. And check-out was seamless. The ease with which I could do everything was ideal.
50,Rooms are larger than average for the strip. Super friendly housekeeping. The property is very clean. Great pool area lots of food choices on the property. Hop on the tram for a quick ride further up the strip. Quiet resort due to it’s location at the end of the strip. Less foot traffic coming in and out.
40,Overall I love Mandalay Bay I have had a few problems but most of the time they are handled promptly and everyone is polite and helpful. Being located at the end of the strip is a little hard to get around walking.
30,At check in asked Jennifer for a room close to the elevator. She said no problem. And then gave us a room at the end of the hall. Not a very good listener. Everything is very expensive. No free coffee. All in the many bar.
50,Great place to stay with lots of restaurants and a food court to eat at. Casino and Hotel Staff are friendly. I had an awesome week here! The pool looked really good but I did not have time to enjoy due to the busy schedule.
50,Staff is excellent so polite . VIP services are really professional.excellent rooms great music nice high limit room Summer time stays are great with the wave pool lazy River and cabanas. Check in are extremely easy
20,We chose this hotel for the pool. My daughter's favorite thing is swimming and hotel pools. When we got there the pool (which is supposed to be heated) and the hot tub were cold. Nothing was heated. Our room had a large bug in it our sink gurgled after we used it every time which kept me up at night and the sheets had a large brown stain on it.    I would have appreciated a coffee pod for the Keurig but you have to pay for them. Free pods are pretty basic at most hotels.    I feel like we could have gotten a much better value for our money at another hotel.
50,Are used to come to Mandalay because of the wave pool and the lazy river. I’ve been coming here since 2007 and I keep coming back. I’ve worked my way up to finally being a gold rewards member. And now I get a lot of the benefits of that. the staff are excellent the food is wonderful and it’s just overall a pleasure to be here.
50,We enjoyed staying at Mandalay Bay Casino for the many amenities that were provided. We had a wonderful time in the wave pool the lazy river and swimming pools. We enjoyed our room on 58th floor with a big tub for an awesome bath.
50,The room was beautiful. The stff members were all beyond helpful. They were all very friendly polite and seemed to be happy to help in any way necessary. The room casino area and restaurants were all clean and there was no lingering smell of cigarette smoke.
50,Really enjoyed my stay and will return again! Service at Noodles was awesome they are really accommodating food was delicious! Slot machines pay and casino is well organized. Easy to find your party or meeting points. Great signage and not so smokey like many casinos that I have been to. In fact it smells great inside.
50,My host Scott Altman was nothing short of amazing with his accommodations. This was my first time meeting him and it seemed as if we’ve known each other for a life time very humble and down to earth. He made sure if I wanted anything it was short lived I mean within minutes he had very satisfying results. I am already thinking of another reason to come back because of his treatment. He is by far the best host I have EVER had he is a GREAT asset to the whole MGM brand and should be recognized for it.. I stayed at the Mandalay Bay and can honestly say it has NEVER been a desired hotel of mine but I will definitely be staying there in the future again ONLY because of his service..
50,Very clean and modern hotel. Friendly staff and plenty of help to address your needs. There are plenty of food options and the Tram is really convenient to move people. The casino had nice ventilation as smoking was not cloudy or overwhelming in those areas
20,Would not recommend unless staying for an event at the hotel or at the stadium. Location is not ideal for enjoying the rest of Las Vegas. The tram system is very limited and only connects to the Luxor and Excalibur.
40,Great stay good food love the sports book. Slot games are fun. We won a decent amount of money and had a lot of fun. Walked the strip and took the tram which helped save walking time. Overall a great location on the strip for fun!
50,Vegas is back. Hotel was full. The service and amenities were great. We enjoyed the casino and food. The pools were awesome. Our room was high and looked right down the strip. The hotel could use another coffee stop!
50,We had a great time. Dinner at Lupo. We stayed at Mandalay Bay and Delano. It was the first time for our family to stay with us all together. Our room had a few problems that didn’t get resolved. Faucet in one side of bathroom didn’t work
40,Everything was wonderful a little worried but it’s just me the door to the bathroom should have a kickstand it’s heavy when you go at night with out running into it LOL So word of caution it’s heavy so don’t go to the bathroom if you really have to go LOL with out running into the door at night LOL
20,Never in my life have I been denied free noon checkout until Mandalay. That was crazy. The room is ok at best. So many better for pretty close price like vdara wynn and cosmo. Staying somewhere else next time
50,This hotel and the Delano are both very dog friendly. The dog relief areas are clean and easily accessible. Bring your walking shoes as the resort is spread out but contains anything and everything you might require.
50,This was a work trip but stayed an extra day to enjoy the resort and check out the pool/beach area. Rooms are clean quiet and comfortable. Lots to explore so lots of walking to the different areas. Wanted to get out to the strip but didn't make it as wasn't sure how to get out of the place.. lol Everything is expensive so have lots of extra cash on hand.
30,Cold showers fluctuating water pressure and small things in need of repair in most areas.  The hotel was in much better shape when I stayed there 5 yers prior.  All of the staff that I encountered were friendly and did their jobs properly.
40,This resort is located at the end (or beginning depending on perspective) of the Strip. The hotel is very clean and staff can be seen at all times continuing to clean and tidy up. I asked that my room not be cleaned but maid service would ask when they saw me if I needed/wanted anything. Although I think charging registered guests for parking is an insult parking was easy and the garage is very close to the casino. The cocktail waitresses are very few and far between but when we were served they were very friendly. Overall if I was able to find a deal I would stay here again.
50,Make sure you go when it's warm out because their pool is amazing! Friendly staff great views and right on the strip. It's only a short cab ride to other parts of Vegas but their is a ton to do right in and near Mandalay Bay.
30,If you're going to Vegas for work there are some pros and cons to staying at Mandalay. The price for the room seemed ok and everything was in good working order. But why in the world should it cost me $50 to store my own bottle of water in the room fridge?  All the restaurants that I visited during my stay were great. Lupo Fleur Citizen's - all really good. But as usual expect to pay a premium.  If your room faces the pool and airport expect a relaxing view where you will hear every plane takeoff in the distance.
40,"The place is very well maintained; the rooms are comfortable clean and attractive without being over-the-top and the staff is lovely But the in-room Keurig is - wait for it - $14. Yes $14 to fill a paper cup with coffee yourself in your room. And they'll charge if you even touch any of the food or beverage items in the room - the cost of which you won't know unless you scan the QR code. Parking is $18 a day the ""resort fee"" of $40 or $50 gets you wifi the gym and ""free 800 calls"" - which are by definition free.The restaurants are ridiculously pricey as well - $26 for a burger soda and fries. Please. And I don't recommend you count on the digital room key - it's pretty unreliable. And the tram doesn't stop there so you'll need to do some walking."
10,Super ugly check-in experience - extremely delayed check in which caused me to be late to work conference and wait in the lobby like a home less with luggage    I checked in through the app over a day before the check in date w no room assigned to me  I called early in that day to check kn status  I went to the check in desk at 2 pm  I went again at 3 PM  I called after 4 PM  I called again over an hour later and the lady was rude and hung up on me    what a mess
40,"The room was great the staff is friendly and hard working. The layout of the check in bell desk and elevators are very well organized for someone with mobility issues. Thank you.  The Issue I had was I was charged for snack items I did not use the last thing I want to do at the end of my vacation is argue over overcharges. The snack center takes up to much of the counter space and is impossible to move over without triggering the sensors. Your snack center sensors are not working correctly and the charge per item is ridiculous. Also I am still waiting to be reimbursed the $100 over charge for ""incidentals""."
40,My husband and I came for a concert- the venue was excellent! Our room was expensive but clean and comfortable. The food choices at the hotel were good but wait times were long and the steak restaurant we chose was extremely pricey for the portions received. There is a lot to do around the property so we didn’t miss not being on the strip. All in all- we will be back!
50,Mandalay Bay is a premier experience with full range of amenities and friendly staff. Great stay. Will return. Convention center facilities were excellent as were fun shows and venues. Food selection is also excellent with wide range of coices
10,Not even an in room coffee is free. Water $11. WATER!?!? Seriously? Tour Helicopters flying around the hotel every two minutes. Super long walk to everything. Room not horribly out of date but not fancy either. Will never stay again.
20,I was attending a conference and had a room on the 24th floor. I had spotty at best cell service and no wifi service. The staff was unable to help and I had to travel 10+ minutes from my room to work. My room had a leftover erotic kit from the prior visitor and a hair pin on the bathroom counter so I'm certain it wasn't clean when I got there.
40,Great hotel for a break poolside and for family visits with kids. Stayed in the 2 bed king spectacular views and spacious. Casino and restaurant choices are similar to other hotels no WOW factor. Michael Jackson Cirque show 10/10.
50,Birthday Trip with my lady friends for our birthdays. Beautiful hotel amazing pool area and plenty of places to eat and shop. We had a room with the view of the Strip and it was beautiful at night. We had a Cabana for a day near The Lazy River and it was so much fun to sit and watch football.
30,I was excited to stay here but the property was not very impressive. We were a number instead of a guest at the check in counter. The elevator entry way stayed overloaded. Our room was loud from the neighboring rooms. Simple talking sneezing restroom etc noise was coming from the rooms near ours. It was clean but the overall experience was a let down. There are higher class properties for the price we paid.
30,Rooms were clean and spacious but the linen quality and lumpy pillows were a disappointment. The bath towels were rough and there were no bathmats supplied or facecloths.  Pools were nice but barely heated in October and there is only one tiny hot tub for a huge pool area.  For the price point I was in unimpressed.
50,Excellent dining easy Checkin on iPad to print my keys. Wish I didn’t lose money but had a great time and great service from stores restaurants and bar area. Wish I had a birthday reward but oh well!
30,Not satisfied with the late checkout policy. We had friends staying at another hotel who were comped their room due to a 10pm flight and we were charged almost $60 and kicked out at 3pm. Mandalay Bay probably won't be our choice next time.
50,We have been going to Mandalay Bay for a few years now and we love the customer service and food quality for room service was great the team was friendly and the Michael Jackson One show was amazing we look forward to watching it again
10,Enjoyed the delicious restaurants (Kumi Sushi and Libertine) and outdoor pool area which had a wave pool and lazy river. However the smoke in the hotel is unbearable. We will choose a smoke-free hotel next time. Also we went to see Michael the Cirque du Soleil and it was so loud we had to leave the show! Very disappointing.
10,We came in late Friday night. We wanted to go downstairs when we came in. So we went up to the room and left our suitcases open and went downstairs. We came back up to our room later that night early morning. Fell into bed. When I woke up I went into the bathroom to brush my teeth and notice bugs fallen from my hair. I realize really quick that something was wrong. I went to the bed pulled back the sheets and saw living moving bed bugs. I couldn’t believe it. I started to feel like I was going to throw up. I went downstairs and spoke to Wilbur one of the managers. I was so upset in tears. He said that it happens my response was NEVER HAS TOO ME. He said they will move us to another room. And clean all our clothes. So we had to go buy new clothes because we had nothing. We did get our clothing back from the cleaners 24 hrs later. But we’re still waiting on our luggage I decided to go home early. I just can’t get pass it. Wilbur did give us a 100.00 meal credit. But I just don’t think anything at this point will make up for what experience I’ve been through. I just keep wanting to throw up… and can’t pass it…. WILL NEVER COME BACK.
50,I had a wonderful experience at Mandalay Bay. The facility is very clean and had plenty of restaurants and other amenities. It really is a top notch location. I would definitely stay there again.  JD Segura  5104684027
50,Hotel is very clean and staff are very pleasant. Restaurants in the hotel had great food. Cannot say enough positive things about the hotel and the staff. Beyond pleased with my stay. Great experience!!
50,Friendly staff Clean rooms great location children friendly pools fun nice cabanas friendly and helpful staff. Easy check in easy check out. Bell caps very helpful. Check in staff very accommodating.
30,Hot water kept stopping (my kids were cold after swimming because no hot water) blackout curtains kept coming off rail. Anytime we reported problems it took them at least half a day to show up. By then we were already sleeping so had the do not disturb sign up and they couldn't fix it. The last time we were there was 4 years ago in the same type of room and was great but could definitely see aging problems this time around.
50,Had a wonderful time. Staff was awesome and very helpful. My whole family was with me. My teenage boys loved to beach area. Only thing I didn’t like was having to buy a tube for the lazy River. If we come back I’d definitely consider staying here again.
20,If you want to pay $7.00 a cup for in room coffee and not have enough plugs for your gadgets you might like this place. However if you are like me I appreciate at some minimum level of amenities without going to the bank. If on the other hand you like being told that no one can help until the next day then this might be the place for you. Las Vegas used to be fun because you were treated special and there were decent priced accommodations. Today at least here they are out to get every cent you don’t lose at their casino. I had hoped for refreshed furnishings and spectacular service only to find outdated decor and the smell of cigarette smoke. Maybe that doesn’t bother you so this could be your place just not mine.
30,Room wasn’t very clean. Tub was filthy and the nightstand was dirty with a liquid under the lamp. There was tape ‘sealing’ the window that flapped when it was windy. I expect at least a clean room for the price we paid.
30,I only need a place to sleep cost 250 plus 44 added at the end for some kind of tax you have to pay separate for anything in the room they should at least have fee water and a coffee pot I will not ever go there again
30,most staff was great but the few that weren't jaded the trip. app didnt work very well and I dont think I got credit for the trip itself. the sports betting app was impossible to figure out alone. very average trip
50,Fancy place with friendly and helpful staff. Casino host Vince Sidoti assists with everything. Casino is not too crowded and areas lay out well. MGM Sports is very accessible. MJ show is worth the money! Great place to stay!
50,5 day get away to Vegas. Food cost is way to high. Other then that great place to stay. I would suggest morning coffee and breakfast prices come down a bit. You are up all night they could at minimum give you a good price standard coffe especially when you have to make it yourself.
30,Difficult to get to main part of strip as well as to and from car in parking garage. To get to monorail you have to get on tram and then cross to another hotel across the street. Easily 45 min just to get to monorail. No fridge or microwave in the room. If you can think of it there’s literally a charge. It is Vegas after all .
50,By far the best experience I’ve had staying in Las Vegas!!! Cleanliness is extremely important to me and I was able to have all of my needs met! So thankful and thoroughly impressed. The service was exceptional. We were treated very well.
30,No hot water on both of the mornings that I stayed. (cold showers for my 5 AM wake up)  I was hosting a neurology conference and showers/grooming were critical. Took away from the overall stay significantly.
40,Great hotel awesome pools. a little far from the strip but the Tram gets you from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur which is a much easier walk to the main part of the strip (and its for fun for kids!). Its Free! but Only runs until midnight though. Pools are awesome but they have a few rules i wish i was made aware of before i lugged the family down there. so read the pool rules what you can bring and cannot and how much per person!
40,Was a great stay! Easy mobile check in no line to stand in! Great location and nice room. No issues or problems and service was great. Would highly recommend others to stay here. Xoxoxo ❤️❤️❤️👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
50,Can’t say enough good stuff about this hotel. Since my first trip to Las Vegas I have made it a point to spend at least one night on this end of the strip. I love the sand beach and ALL the pool access Mandalay has to offer. The rooms even the last minute end of the week ran out of money bookings are spectacular. Clean well appointed and worth the jaunt from the elevator. I’m a fan of the end of the strip location quick trip from Highway and after the walk up back down the strip the sand beach is that much better!
50,My wife and I had a great time at Mandalay Bay. Very clean casino very clean rooms and nice big bathroom. This is a hotel we would take our kids for the shops the aquarium and the pools. Also the spa is amazing My wife and I did a couples message and it was great. Over all we have nothing but good things to say at Mandalay Bay. This is also at the end of the strip so not to crazy or packed which was perfect.
10,I have been to Vegas many times and have never had the experience that I had this time. First off we were greeted by the most amazing front desk check in person. His name was Clint. He was the only positive experience of this entire stay. After checking in we went to put our baggage with the bell hop because our room was not ready. Rick was the most disrespectful person we have ever dealt with. We tried to ask a few questions but was constantly interuped by him trying to hurry us along and acting as if we were pieces of trash. Instantly the regret for staying at a new resort was a mistake. We have stayed at Bellagio in the past and Ceasars Palace and this was a mistake to come here. After finally getting our stuff put away we headed down to the pool area where we thought we would be able to escape the bad experience. I have never gotten into a lazy river or pool that was as cold as these. We live in Illinois and have a pool without a heater and this was absolutely colder than any pool ever. Literally took my breath away. Life guards were on their phones while sitting on their chairs. Wave pool we entered into and was quickly attacked because we didnt know we had to run in to get to the 3 ft spot. We were trying to get in because it was so cold. Just an all around disappointment. Pool area and walk way areas were very dirty. Lastly the night before we left we checked our balance and noticed a charge for alcohol. I quickly called front desk because we did not even touch our mini fridge. They said they would take care of it. So yes that was good but as the night went on we pieced together a few unusual things. A couple hours after we were eating lunch we came up to find our room had been cleaned and there was a bag of beef jerkey on the desk area. Again the the jerky that was on the little snack area. We thought it must have been a mistake left by a cleaning person. An hour later a cleaning person came and knocked on our door to see if we wanted our room clean??? Weird because it already was. My thought was maybe she was coming to put away the alcohol that was taken from our fridge. I reported to the front desk but never heard anything else. Overall very disrespectful staff throughout the entire resort. The ONLY positive thing was when we left and our guest check in person CLINT.
50,Easy to get around to other resorts from Mandalay. Great hotel staff. Friendly casino staff. Lots of games and restaurants to choose from. But bring your own water\drinks\snacks...the concessions are super expensive.
50,The Mandalay Bay is a great resort the pools are awesome great choice of restaurants. Rooms are very nice really don’t have to leave the facility if you don’t want to. Michelob arena connected was perfect Michael Jackson Cirque was amazing!
50,Great Customer service. Everyone seemed very welcoming. The experience made our stay even better. From the elderly gentleman bringing our luggage to our room to the housekeeper cleaning our room. Everything was exceptional
10,Don’t know if it’s just this hotel but the customer service it the worst I have ever experienced and I have been all over the world . From the front desk staff to the restaurant staff  Citizen Cafe -rude  Sea breeze cafe -rude  Front desk staff the worst in the world  And they all expect tips- how can you tip for super rude bad service.  Do not recommend
50,It was a great stay. The room was amazing ton of room great soaking tub and the bed was super comfortable. Definitely top 3 places to stay in Vegas! The shark reef was a lot of fun and so was the pool! Can’t wait to go back!
40,We came with our granddaughter. There are lots of things to do with kids. The shark exhibit was amazing. The restaurants offered lots of variety. The shops were clean and diverse. The reason this is not a 5 is smoke. Smoking is allowed in the casinos. To get places you need to walk through. The smell of smoke is evident even though I’m sure they try to mask it.
50,Mandalay Bay is an excellent hotel with great amenities and and very easy to get around. The staff was pleasant and the restaurants were great. The wait staff were very attentive and helpful. Everything was convenient and well laid out.
50,We really were excited to go here but quickly found out the “extra costs” made it real expensive. No one around to help you with luggage. Parking lot is full and 1/2 mile away. Then we were told $130 to park
50,The beds at Mandalay Bay are the most comfortable you will find! Even after long days working on my feet I always had the best sleep. So much so that I’m considering purchasing the mattress set from Mandalay Bay (they sell them). The spa is always a must when you visit. Any service will get you full day access to the spa with an amazing serene pool (don’t have to be in the crowded outdoor pool!). Spa pricing was also very reasonable compared to other Vegas hotel spas. Well worth it to treat yourself during your stay!
50,Had a great stay brought my Mom for her 81st birthday. We all had a great time.    Over the stay was great… even with two conventions at the hotel it was not overwhelming or over crowded.    Will stay again.
10,Hotel room has zero free amenities. You get charged for everything in the room…coffee and $24 dollars for ONE bottle of water. Towels in the room are cheap as well as the towels at the beach. Beach is overcrowded. There are too many chairs for the available space and too many people. There are more luxurious hotels available in Vegas for the price that they charge. Find another place to stay.
40,Nice place to stay.  but I think if you’re brining your family you’re better off going to Palm Springs or Disney world. I didn’t have the kids I was there for business. Safe to say that I wouldn’t come here for pleasure. Room service is a joke. Food comes in paper plates that your eggs stick to lol. Drinks for get about it. Loose slots are no where around. We didn’t roll for about a hour on craps and made some money there but when I went to restroom. Staff flowered me in wtf (pit boss)
30,Staff and service were great but the room wasn't very nice for what we were paying for it. Not a great value.    Front desk was very helpful and we're willing to help with any questions we had including the use of the food credit
50,Beautiful & clean property. Staff are all friendly & helpful. Lots of choices for restaurants entertainment & some on site shopping. In the heart of shopping & other casinos if you ever feel you need to leave the property. Beautiful pools.
20,My room was nice but nothing special. No bathrobe so so amenities. I cannot believe they charged me $14 to unseal a disposable cup and make myself a cup of tea using my own tea bag brought from home. I am feeling violated and will avoid this property and any other MGM resort in the future if I have a choice.
50,Wonderful property to spend time at. Very nice rooms GREAT Casino area friendly staff. Wave pool and Lazy River are excellent choices to relax and just have fun.  Depending on preferences rooms with a pool view are an choice to enjoy while in the room. Strip View rooms do give the opportunity to view just how amazing the Strip is.
50,I’ve stayed here several times! Hotel 🏨 is always nice and clean! Always been satisfied with my stay. Hotel staff is very friendly & helpful. Had a great time at slice restaurant the pizza 🍕 was very delicious Lol along with the mojitos!!🍸
50,Had always wanted to stay here finally got the chance to book a Penthouse Suite and it was well worth it for a romantic weekend getaway. The layout was spacious the view of the Nevada landscape was something to see and that spacious bathroom was the real highlight! The staff was super friendly and the dinning options were top quality spots .    Overall we had a great time another great MGM property.
10,I was told I would receive a text when my room was ready so I took my belongings to the bellhop service they offer where they took my ID for verification purposes. Took my luggage and didn’t give me any sort of proof they could bring me my things. I waited 7 hours with no text and saw a large number of people check in and go to their rooms immediately upon entering. So I went to the front desk where they tried to charge me again for my security deposit and resort fees. I was called a liar in a roundabout way and finally resolved the charges after a conversation with a manager. The bellhop service didn’t bring my things to my room because I didn’t have a ticket that was never offered to me I went to the desk of the bellhop service and was told my things would be brought to me. I waited an hour and a half to get these things with no results. I went again to the desk where I was then called a liar yet again because I was told that my things were to be delivered to me in the lobby. Far from the truth. He radioed another employee who was supposed to have my stuff and not surprisingly he didn’t have them either. I was asked yet again for a ticket which had never been given to me. He then led me into a room with everyone’s else’s things except mine (which I hunted for for 30 minutes). He led me into yet another room where I spotted my things which was on a cart getting ready to be loaded into someone else’s car because even with my ID my name was somehow misspelled. I talked to a manager about my experience where I was told I would receive a $75 credit (an insulting offer I feel based on the overall price of the stay) but after the “runaround” I had already received I didn’t have the energy to negotiate any further. This is by far the worst experience I have ever received from a hospitality company in turn ruining my entire Las Vegas experience.
10,"Maintenance decided to jack hammer in the room above me at 8:30 pm one night for 45 mins and then began again at 8:30 am until I left. Calls to the front desk kept getting disconnected and I was hung up on twice. The statement I finally heard was ""we don't have anything to do with maintenance""."
20,Room is big n comfy bed. No water or coffee unless u r ready to pay $24 per bottle n $10 for a cup in yr room! Saving personal item has a charge of $50. No cleaning til 6pm the latest unless u call in
10,Our room was extremely dirty and the engineer tech enter room while I was alone (woman) and spoke through the door and replaced air filter. The door had a large gap allowing him to see directly into my shower.
50,Mandalay Bay is a great place to stay with a friendly casino and clean modern rooms. We love the large variety of great restaurants and how close together everything is. The Michael Jackson One show was incredible.
50,I requested a room not too far from the elevator because I’m a long way from being young. The room was perfect. A nice view of the strip and located a few rooms down the corridor. Would definitely recommend this hotel.
50,My wife and I stayed at Mandalay Bay last week. We were visiting for my wife's 50th Birthday. Katie Power found out we were visiting for this very special event and really made the difference with her support to make it unforgettable experience. Can not thank her and the staff at Mandalay. Thank you so much Katie and team! We will be back!
10,I’ve visited Vegas multiple times and this was by far the worst experience. Staff was very rude the room was not clean I asked the housekeeper for towels she rudely responded isn’t there towels in the room. Security almost ran man over and never apologized
20,My stay was seriously affected by them taking over $4000 in access of my room cost off of my credit card. I was offered ZERO compensation other than a $150 food and beverage room credit. That is an absolute joke.
10,The stay was good until the end. I went to check out and saw they let someone charge something to my room then they charged me twice very unprofessional staff and won't even answer their phone now when I try to call.
40,The room was nice the staff helpful but they charge for EVERY little thing: $14 for a water bottle $14 for a cup of coffee in your room. And our bathroom smelled like sewer every time the room above us used their bathroom.
50,Daughter's Wedding at the Chapel was flawless. Dinner afterwards in a room at RiRa was excellent. Suite in the Delano for an afterparty worked well. Lack of access to a bar fridge in the rooms was problematic. Only room for provided drinks and nothing else.
50,I have stayed at Mandalay Bay several times. The room was beautiful and clean. The customer service was top notch. We will be staying here again. The location is a little further away on the strip but was not a problem for us.
50,My stay was for a real estate convention. Best stay in Vegas in a while! Hotel staff dining drinks pool...everything was top notch! The bartender at Fleur was especially helpful and the beef tar tar and filet was magnificent!
30,Costly and inconsistent delivery of sleep/bath items. Expected to pay for use of fridge $50 per day. Pretty far away from most attractions. Restaurants messed up  Orders or made us wait for our checks.
50,Want the VERY BEST ENTIRE VEGAS experience? Then MANDALAY BAY is where you should STAY...Dining Entertainment Accommodations Night Life Gaming Sports Spa and Pools-They have it ALL! Perfect in Every Way...
20,The room AC didn't work which was not conducive to a good night sleep. The bathroom sink handle didn't function properly. There is a coffee maker in the room but you have to pay for the k-cups and paper cups (about $7). The line to get real coffee on property was very long. There were no cotton balls q-tips nail file etc. in the room.
50,My wife gave me a Vegas trip for my 60th birthday. I had never been and I must say it was a great vacation. Room was great; clean with awesome views. Meals at Citizens had some of the best service I've ever experienced anywhere. Pools were amazing although poolside drinks were a little pricey but that's ok as the service poolside was excellent. Easy to get an UBER from hotel to anywhere and the tram was neat between the three hotels. Would highly recommend and will stay here on our next trip. As we were new to the sports gambling scene the people at the counter were very helpful as well.
30,They did nothing to impress. For the price wasn't worth the price. Had dirty sheets (stained). The AC was set too high. You could adjust the thermostat to a lower temp but the room would not go cooler. Its just ok but sure not a VIP experience.
50,Now this is annoying I’ve typed this review three times. So you could streamline this process but otherwise I had an amazing time at MB. The beach. The staff. The room. The Michael Jackson show. The shoppes. The restaurants.
20,Horrible customer experience. Digital key didn’t work. 25 minutes in line to resolve with no apology from front desk staff. Every bartender in every bar we visited was horrible. We ate at Burger Bar and the service was so horrible we left an $.89 tip on a $100 bill only because we didn’t have $.11 only cash. We spent thousands of dollars on this vacation and at this “resort” and it was nothing short of disappointing!!
40,pre-check-in process was a bit bumpy. parking barcode was not registering needed to call for assistance. I still  had to check in at the front desk because room key was not loading to the app neither was the key working in the elevator. I was in an adjoining room and I could hear entire conversation of the guest next door. (lots of profanity seperate party) Otherwise the room was nice and clean. Staff was friendly and helpful. The check-out process was painless (checked out from TV and dropped keys off in drop box first floor.) I would stay here again despite the tech glitches.
50,The Hotel is in a good location it's near the airport. The staff is better than the other Hotel/Casinos I've been to; they are always super helpful. The restaurants are so good you never need to leave the Hotel.
30,There were really creepy and weird noises at night. No we were not drunk lol. turned on all the lights looked in the hallways and we couldnt figure out were they were coming from. It was on the 22nd floor.
50,Really enjoyed the Mandalay Bay. Hotel rooms were clean and spacious. The staff was great. The pool has lots of options - a lazy river sandy beach and wave pool and a quiet pool. I liked the location as it was easy to get to the busy part of the strip but it wasn't overly crowded.
50,My stay at the Mandalay Bay during my real estate conference was exceptional. Everything from check-in to check-out was world class. A great location great food amazing beach and pools made this stay AMAZING! Can’t wait to stay here again.
50,Packed shows every night. Never had a bad meal. Drinks were on the spot. The wave pool legitimately feels/sounds like you are at a beach. Casino dealers were friendly and easy to chat with. Really wish I could relive that weekend.
40,Spent a week in Las Vegas at the Mandalay Bay for EXPCON2022. Lovely resort with an amazing pool area. The Tuesday night eXp social in the pool area was a definite highlight. Good food! Great restaurants. The convention centre could handle all 6500+ Realtors from around the world.
50,Took the kids and hubby to Vegas to celebrate my 40th bday and we had a blast. Kids enjoyed it even though people saying it’s not for kids but I live taking my kids on special occasion no matter where it is
50,Unlike a lot of properties on the strip I feel MB is the easiest to navigate as a guest. The rooms are large and comfortable. The pools are fantastic. The gaming is almost always loose and comfortable.
40,I was worried about the reviews on the rooms that I read; they were NOT true. The carpet and rooms were clean and nice; not dated like everyone else had said. The MGM Rewards program however needs a serious face lift. They need better rewards!
50,Great Experience I enjoyed my stay the staff was great and the food ootions were excellent. Especially StripSteak. Some of the best food I have tasted in a long time. Not your typical buffet food. It is a real resturant with great service.
40,The stay was great the only thing is that the self park garage is far from the rooms. But the overall stay was great room was extremely spacious and the staff was fantastic and took great care of me and my friends.
30,We stayed at the hotel over the weekend and it was over $300 a night. The room was an upscale average room with not a whole lot of Bells and whistles The room was an upscale average room with not a whole lot of Bells and whistles. Very disappointing that we couldn't get even the basic complimentary coffee in the room. If you want to make a cup of coffee plan on spending 12 bucks for a Keurig cup of coffee. We expect to pay higher prices but 14.00 for a medium can of pringles..Pringle... seriously??? They are really taking advantage of inflation here.
10,They gave us the worst room in the building and if we weren’t so busy we would have requested a change. 3 restaurants we tried were just ok. Better food at Luxor and off strip. Worth the cab ride to another place Lol.
50,We have been to Mandalay Bay in the past but had never stayed in the hotel. Everything was great (all of the staff rooms casino pool conference center and so much more). They offer a variety of food choices. The Foundation Room was a great experience as well. The atmosphere food staff and the roof top views are beautiful. We will be back!
40,Not appreciate the fact they charge for mini bar 50 usd per night parking lot not included on a high priced hotel fee mattresses were terrible uncomfortable I wasn’t able to sleep during my stay. But other than that hotel has many good areas and service to offer.
50,An enjoyable stay very nice property. Well-maintained good selection of restaurants. Friendly staff amazing views. Easy access to casinos mall connecting the Luxor and restaurants. Handles large numbers of people with ease.
30,We stayed at Mandalay Bay for 3 nights in July. We checked in late at night so no long lines. Our friends checked in the day before us and waited over 1 hour to check in.    We stayed on the 16th floor overlooking the pool area. Room was clean though touch ups were needed. Bathroom door knob wouldn't work properly.    The wave pool was so fun. Lazy river was crowded but also still fun. Our kids (ages 9 and 11) had a great time.
50,Stayed here before for leisure but this time was for a conference. The hotel is always very well staffed clean smells fresh. Our rooms were nicely tidied up with no issues at all. Just wish coffee was on the house… for the amount of money we pay.
40,Mandalay Bay is a must if you are bringing children but don't forget their swim diapers and floaties...they charge $6 for a swim diaper and $45 for the foam arm floaties or you can rent a life jacket for free. They also charge $50 for a fridge in the room...you can request one for the toddler/baby and it's free of charge. The tram doesn't run until 10am so don't plan tours early if you need the tram to get you there with littles (otherwise you can take a taxi and can do so legally without a car seat but it felt unsafe for us...for obvious reasons) Everyone was extremely friendly with the exception of the bag valet
50,We found the staff friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and well-maintained. Restaurants were varied and tended to be expensive. We liked Fleur which had great food and really good service. We really enjoyed the Cirque du Soleil show Jackson One! The conference facilities are extensive and easy to find.
40,As expected nice amenities and courteous staff. Downside is not being allowed to utilize room mini-refrigerator for personal items without incurring a $50 charge. That's to discourage bringing your own booze so you have to buy the $28 daiquari at the poolside bar...obnoxious markups on alcohol...bring tyour own.
30,One rep told me I had to wait until 3pm or after 3pm to check-in unless I wanted a wheel chair accessible room. Only for another rep at another front desk to give me a key to the room I booked. The property and other staff were friendly and kind and I'd stay there again.
30,Beautiful resort - We stayed for the pool.    The Good  We extended our stay an additional day and Brendan (spelling?) at the front desk was so helpful.  House cleaning was great too. When I asked her if she had shower gel she apologized that she did not but offered to see if she could find some for me! I didn't take her up on the offer but how sweet was that?  Rooms were large with a lot of space to move around  Pool (of course)  Drink service on the casino floor was good    The Bad  Can't even put a bottle of water in the fridge or they will charge for use (or they can loan you a fridge for $35/day)  Too far from the meat of the strip (unless you want to get your steps in)  Two options for breakfast and they serve the same thing - again far from any other options.  Tables were HIGH ($50 minimum on Friday night) We went downtown and played Blackjack and Three Card for $5.    Don't know if I would go back unless the price was right too many other options for cheaper eating/gambling just down the road.
10,Not what I thought it would be. Hair and urine in the bathroom upon arrival the Hotel charges $50 a DAY to use a small fridge! Do not recommend. Health department should pay a visit to this place. Will not go back.
50,Options are yours here.. great place to stay at believe there was 4 different pools gym high class lounges traditional clubs. Food gambling and plenty of things to do. I never needed to leave once.
10,This hotel does not offer even the most minor of amenities!!! No coffee in your room for less that$14 extra dollars no use of the refrigerator with out extra money?! No breakfast. Yet the charge an additional$35 dollars for use of the pool etc... I hated being there
50,Wonderful hotel and conference center. Wasn’t a fan of the cigarette smoke but that’s a norm in Vegas. The hotel wasn’t very accommodating to health conditions in providing a small fridge and that helped significantly because the in room fridge is stocked for items to buy only.
50,Living in Maryland makes the trip to LV a very long and uncomfortable 4-5 . However once my husband and I arrived the fun starts immediately. A short 10 min drive and we are there. The room was very nice and ready early. The property was clean plenty of slots the concierge was very helpful and the restaurants were great. We stayed 6 nights and could have stayed 3 or 4 more
10,Shower incident occurred while there and ac unit loud and disturbing. Indicates rooms are not properly maintained. Felt under valued for the resolution offered for the inconvenience that we endured during our stay.
50,All was great staff was polite and professional and rooms were amazingly clean. Bed was comfortable shower and tub was great. This was our first time staying here and all I can say is that next time I come to Vegas this is our hotel to stay in
50,The mobile check-in experience was fast and easy. The digital key was easy to use and the mobile kiosk was fast to print more keys for your guest. The overall room was clean updated and nice. There were snacks and a mini bar available in the room. Personal refrigerator was available for an extra charge.
10,If anything is wrong you’re on your own. They are understaffed and there is no one to make things right and no one to help.    The room phone was broken. Calling from my cell incited multiple questions to verify I was as current guest inside the property. After that they didn’t have anyone available to replace the phone or deliver a refrigerator (at an extra charge) and no one to credit my parking fees that were double changed because the parking system wasn’t functioning properly to recognize my prepaid parking access code.  Good luck.
50,We stayed at the Mandalay Bay Resort for a conference and found the staff helpful from the moment we checked in loved the express check in through the tablets the room was luxurious spacious room and bathroom with garden tub and separate shower the room was also clean. The elevators were fast and the restaurant experience was also good and fast. We enjoyed our experience there and look forward to visiting again next year!
50,Me and about a dozen of my real estate team spent a week there recently along with about 6000 other real estate Agents for our Real Estate Brokerage's annual convention. Great time! Great location. Great service!
20,This hotel is too expensive to not provide complimentary coffee and fridge use. Want to store your food in the fridge.. that will be $50. Want to use the coffee maker.. that will be $14 per cup. Ridiculous.
50,Amazing experience service was great 😊 our time there was the best! We were so comfortable in our room and with all the amenities my only suggestion would be to have water refill stations because water is so expensive and it’s so dry there!
50,This has been by far one of the best business trips that I have taken. Let me be the first to say that the beds were very plush and I slept like a baby when I did get in the bed. The food court could have had a little more different choices but I am not going to complain. I really enjoyed myself and my family has a family reunion coming up and I hope that they choose the Mandalay Bay as the host hotel. But if not my family will definitely be back for a family vacation Summer 2023.
50,Great time other than drinks and food being ridiculously overpriced great time had by all. Would recommend hotel for families with younger children. Wave pool and lazy river were Awsome. Hotel accommodations were great easy to navigate and explore
10,Poor customer service. Spoke to a representative Cindy on the phone before landing who assured I could check-in. Once I arrived I was informed that I did not have a room and Cindy didn’t exist even though she issued me a rewards number. Instead of being reassured that they there were rooms available but at a different rate. Landing in a city and not knowing if you have a place to sleep is very scary and unsettling. Again instead of coming to us with assurance and understanding we received attitude and unprofessionalism nothing I’ve experienced in the industry. I would recommend the manager of the Seabreeze Cafe to train the front desk. She was kind caring with a super positive triticale - completely unlike the front desk.    Additionally once we arrived to our room we found an unidentified blue pill on the nightstand panel broken and hanging off the wall and a cigarette hole in the sheets. None of which was ever fixed during our stay after we reported up right when we arrived.    We found much of the food and beverage departments downstairs to be outstanding with great customer service it’s just the hotel staff that seems to learn they are in the hospitality industry and to treat their guests with a higher level of service and kindness.
20,Literally charge for everything; charge for chairs at the beach charge to open a umbrella that’s already sitting there $20 for 2 small juice and a can of Pringle’s. You get charged if you open the fridge door in the room have to pay to rent a fridge. Have to pay to use the gym..
30,"Room was nice except one of our towels had a huge hole in it. Refrigerator for ""personal"" use (empty not stocked with over-priced items) is an extra $35 a night. Not as close to other attractions. Restaurant choices were a bit limited. Went for a conference which was fine since it was work. Would not stay there for personal vacation."
20,Room was dirty and dated. Initial room hadn’t been fully cleaned. Final room had stuff on bathroom walls and in tub I had to wash off. Pool view was only nice thing. For the price it’s not worth it. It’s not nice like it used to be.
50,Stayed for 5 nights and this is the best hotel in Vegas. Don’t be put off by it’s location as there is walkways and a free shuttle to the main part of the strip. The rooms are huge and the staff are extremely friendly. The different food options in the hotel are excellent. The range of machines and games on the casino floor are also amazing!
40,I encountered a problem and I was extremely disappointed with the front desk management as to how they handle It. Front desk personnel is literally the face of the hotel and entire company. Because that’s the person who the guest sees when they first walk through the doors of the property.
30,The hotel itself was fine. Rooms were spacious albeit dated. The smoking and the casino which let's face it you can't go anywhere without going through the casino was terrible. Everything is automated so you really don't have any staff to engage with. That's fine I guess. The worst part was that we needed to make a lunch reservation for a business lunch and we tried to do that a week in advance and nothing was available. Most restaurants are not open for lunch. Considering that we were there for a conference and there were 16000 people in the hotel for the conference you would think that they would open more restaurants. I would not stay here unless I have to
50,We stayed at Mandalay Bay for an eXp Realty convention. Besides being beautiful our view of the strip was excellent. Glenn at the concierge desk was so helpful and got us the best seats at a show we saw.
50,We had an incredible stay at the Mandalay Bay. The facilities were clean and compared to most of the other hotels on the strip smoke smell was not too bad. rooms were clean and housekeeping did a great job. The restaurants in this hotel are also excellent.
50,Beautiful hotel with every amenity you could need. The rooms were well appointed and the bathroom reminded me of home with dual sinks and separate tub and shower. The wave pool and “beach” was relaxing and there were several restaurants to choose from. Highly recommend.
50,Mandalay Bay was a great place for our company summit with 6000 people. It was easy to get from the room to restaurants and the expo. The resort is clean and it has friendly staff. Their wave pool is fun to hangout at!
50,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Beds super comfy rooms very nice. Beach and additional pools were great. Would highly recommend. The shuttle was also super helpful and cuts down on your cab fares to and from the strip
40,The room was great. Loved the security accessing elevator Great restaurants. Great band in the lounge. Loved the Foundation Room. Great muffins as Citizens. Easy access to Uber/taxi/airport. Overall a great time.
10,Dirty rooms after we requested cleaning  No water at all in showers they eventually offered another room  The grand finale grease on white leather seats when picked up from valet.  They didn’t even comp a room for a night!
30,Way over priced rooms. Food was ok but definitely high priced. Drinks were way over priced. No one should ever pay $54 for a 6 pack of beer. I understand inflation but this is ridiculous. We will never stay there again.
50,Beautiful pool was outstanding food was top notch entertainment was great using the tram made getting around easy and convenient and put everything within easy walking distance. Checking in with mobile device was easy
50,Great location family friendly kind staff and the Border Grill is scrumptious! Casino is good size. Nice shops located inside. Great size MGM sports area to enjoy all the Sunday games. Food court is simple but Subway was always open when we needed a snack.
10,Let’s be honest. This place is clearly not a top tier hotel and therefore my expectations are not high. However running water is a very basic expectation.    Not once but twice my shower ran out of water mid shower. Not just the hot water I am talking ALL water. Like just stopped.    I also had a very bad experience with the pit boss in the high limit room. Irregardless of the fact that I was playing a VERY high limit average you don’t disrespect your players for no reason at all. And when I called him on it we ended up in a face to face argument.    It wasn’t until the big boss upstairs came down to apologize that this issue ended. Not resolved just ended.
10,We were on the 30th floor panoramic suite with 2 adults and 4 children. We ate dinner and then came up to shower and bathe for bed. The tub and showers had hairs in it that didn’t match any of our hair colors. There was some conditioner on the walls in the shower. I assumed it was a really big suite so they couldn’t make the time to clean it all. We showed around 9 and we’re asleep by 11. We use white noise machines. Around 1 am the phone rings and it’s very loud. We’re trying to find it in the dark but we can’t. We can’t understand why someone would be calling us at 1 am so we panic and go looking for our 11 9 7 and 2 year olds in the other rooms to make sure they are safe and didn’t disappear or something crazy.    Phew they were all safe! We heard voices in the hallway and my wife looks out the door to discover 2 people in blue matching shirts. We didn’t hear anyone announce or suspect any reason for them to be there so we became worried. Especially after the shooting there is reason to not trust security. I watched out the peep hole for a while and they kept looking in at me but I couldn’t hear anything they were saying. Finally I cracked the door and asked what they were doing. I was a bit worried they could have a gun or try to do something crazy. They said there was an emergency and our room was flooding the room below. I said everyone is asleep. He asked to come in so one waited and held the door open. While the other used his flashlight to come check the bathroom. All the lights were off everyone was sleeping and there was no water on the floor in the tub or anywhere else. No running water no sitting water. We had been asleep for 2 hours.    I complained to the manager about what happened and he said it was an emergency and our room was flooding the room below. I asked why they rented me a room that wasn’t ready to be occupied and he said it was ready. Clearly it was not because it was flooding the room below without any doing on our end. He said at this moment it’s flooding it again. We weren’t even in the room when he said that. We had already packed and left. He was kind enough to waive the resort and parking fees and give us $100 to use at the restaurant but none of that makes up for being traumatized in the middle of the night with something like that.    The worst part was that the manager kept telling me how sometimes people overflow the bathtub or flood the room and these emergencies are the fault of the customer. We did nothing wrong.
50,Most of strip hotels are sold out on the Columbus week so we decided to try out Mandalay bay. It was beyond expectations my kids love the pools and the room are amazing... we also got a special upgrade room as well.
20,This hotel is older and the rooms definitely need to be refreshed. If you have allergies note they allow pets and don’t have any pet free areas for allergic guests. The gym is tiny and always packed so don’t expect to use it while there
50,My stay at Mandalay bay was amazing. Great service. Good payout. MGM rewards is the only rewards program which gives complimentary room + food+ freeplay.  No other casino has this extraordinary guest satisfaction & service.
20,"I have dreamed of having my kids stay at the Mandalay Bay Hotel to see the sharks and enjoy the beautiful hotel / rooms. Our experience was not one that i would like to relive. We were told 2 separate amounts when trying to park our ""oversized"" vehicle. First one was the price we paid for the room itself! We were told only cash to park. We checked in and got up to our room. Bathroom smelled like marijuana for the duration of our stay. We were in a non-smoking room. You are charged for every single thing in the room...a Keurig cup of coffee that would would make yourself (and is normally free in other hotels) would cost us $12 each cup! Not the experience we were expecting at all."
30,The service I received from the front office staff was not friendly or helpful at all. The room was clean and spacious and even though it stated that we were getting rooms in the back the view was still nice. The ice machine was broken majority of the time. We didn’t have any face or hand towels in our room and had to call housekeeping to bring some up. I expected way more especially for the price I paid. The bed was very comfortable!
30,We stayed here for access to Allegiant stadium and the ease of Maneuvering back and forth was great. The spa was nice and the masseuse was excellent. There really only 1 spot to grab quick eats which was good. The pool and bay area was massive and I'm sure great if you had kids. Our biggest complaint and the staff even acknowledged this was their internet connection. The connections were so bad we couldn't access our digital cards and get out of the elevators. It's a good hotel but there are others that we stay at for upgraded facilities and amenities.
30,Room was not very clean. There was an old ear ring on the floor. Then housekeeping skipped my room the next day. No wash cloths left. Bad service from housekeeping. When I called they acted non chalant.
50,Excellent experience at the hotel. Loved my room and the amenities from the hotel. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. There were nice stores and dining places within the hotel. I am really looking forward to coming back
50,Mandalay Bay is one of the best places to stay on The Strip! The rooms are spacious clean and comfortable. The staff is warm and welcoming. The amenities are great and there is a lot to do in the casino other than gambling (the sports bar is great). The facility is well laid out clean and doesn't smell like smoke. The rooms are a really good value for the money.
50,My family and I stayed 3 nights at Mandalay Bay and loved it. Lupo is a wonderful restaurant. The security staff is on top of things! The casino staff was great and very attentive to everything! The rooms are top notch. The app could use some work but don't let that steer you away. Gorgeous property. Awesome pools!
40,The hotel was very nice but the price is overwhelming. Very clean and friendly staff though I did have one problem at check in they put the wrong number of my room and had to go back down and they wrote the wrong room number.
50,The Mandalay Bay was an awesome stay. We had something to do at anytime. Taxi service is there to take you anywhere. Restaurant on every corner casino shopping aquarium art gallery club and it was not in the busy part of the Strip. I liked that
10,Bad location to the strip horrible cell reception scarce dining options that close early key card app constantly crashing $50 to use fridge in room $25 to use coffee in room. No positives at all.
50,You couldn't pick a better location to stay if you're going to a game at Allegiant Stadium!! Staff was terrific . . . all meals especially Strip Steak were fantastic! There's a lot of energy in the casino with multiple live music venues . . . great choices for coffee in a.m. I've stayed there for years and it is as good as ever!!!
50,We went to book tickets for the show “Love the Beatles” and Jasmine J was awesome. I came with my sisters because one was celebrating her 60th birthday and she made her feel special. She couldn’t have been more polite professional and efficient. I would recommend going there to get tickets for anything and have her take care of you. Thanks again Jasmine J!!
40,MB is an older property but I think because it’s proximity to the rest of the strip makes it one of the least travelled multiple star resorts. Check in is quick staff are friendly casino floor is huge but easy to navigate rooms are dated but clean and has the tram which is easy access to Luxor and Excalibur for a little low rolling expedition. Location and slightly dated rooms take it down a notch but definitely worth a stay.
30,The only real value that we experienced was the location. The room was average and way over priced for what we recieved. We were given a room over looking a garage. Our iPhone 13s on Verizon did not work very well in the lobby and in the room and their wifi was UNSECURED. That alone in these times is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.
40,"Don't get me wrong I love Mandalay Bay and always stay there when I'm in Vegas -- which is often -- but this time it was obvious that the rooms need some love. Everything is very old and for the love of all things holy please get rid of the carpet and put in some vinyl ""wood"" flooring. Also a venting system in the bathrooms (which seems like an obvious thing) is desperately needed. The room was very clean so that's a plus but it's starting to feel a bit ""run down"" which is a bummer."
50,Hotel and Casino are excellent venues for the various amenities the hotel offers. The pools are quite extensive and have a beach with a wave pool  a river pool and other pool areas. The Casino is not crowded with visitors and slots are not jammed together but offer room to breath. Sportsbook is the best on the strip. Hotel rooms are clean and have appropriate size. The hotel elevators take you directly to the pool area which is extremely convenient so you don't have to walk thru the casino with your bathing suit! Overall the best overall experience.
50,Mandalay Bay is the best place to stay while in Vegas. It’s location at the end of the strip makes it a place where it’s not the craziness you find on the strip. I have stayed at a couple other hotels and I keep coming back to Mandalay Bay
50,Truly a wonderful resort. The food was so good. The staff is so friendly. The pools are incredible. The only place I will stay in Vegas. Every trip to Mandalay Bay is amazing. This I the only Vegas experience you ever need.
30,Not a lot of food options after 11pm. It was ok. The hotel was a bit dirtier than other hotels. Internet didn’t work. For the price it was a bit rundown. It was an average stay for us and I don’t think we will be returning. Very pricey for what it is.
50,Don’t let the negative reviews scare you off! A friend and I stayed for a girls’ weekend and the negative reviews on TripAdvisor had me worried. For NOTHING! The property was very clean and felt moderately luxurious. I took the advice of another traveler and downloaded the app and checked in as soon as I landed at 9:30 in the morning. As a result we had a room by 10:30! No lines no wait no fuss. It was great. I’d happily stay again!
10,Arrived for a one night romantic get away. The TV had a welcoming for a different guest. It also did not work when attempting to use the remote. Pubic hair in shower. Called for help with the TV. Tech did not arrive until 11:30 after we were asleep. I was charged over 300 dollars. I was told one of the charges was for M&M. We did not touch any of the items. When I asked what the charges were for I did not get any itemized bill with explanation. Once again this all in just a one night stay my wife and I thought we would enjoy. Fan blower was stationed outside our room. I believe it was to dry the carpet. Blower was still there the next morning when we left at 4:30 AM. Never again
50,Check in was easy everything was great everyone was nice and helpful. Was nice that I could get to Luxor by tram. Express check out wouldn't work but they quickly helped me so I would make my appt on time. Would definitely stay again.
50,I've stayed at a few other MGM casinos on the strip and was my favorite. It is easy to access the tram if you want to venture up the strip without walking. Elevators to rooms and pool area are right there at the casino without having to walk a mile. The staff were all very friendly. The casino area was clean and spacious. Stayed in a standard 2 queen room and it was very spacious and a large bathroom with 2 sinks and separate toilet room. Plenty of options for dining. Live free entertainment in the casino area.
10,This hotel has the worst location on the strip. There is nothing that benefits the guest whatsoever. Ridiculously overpriced food and drink. A touch sensitive mini bar with 12$ m&ms. We had breakfast the last day with no cocktails and it was 125$ before tip. We had to purchase 2 bottles of water at the “convenience” market the last night and it was over13$. The hotel bathroom and toiletries were sub par at best. We will not be back even if it was free.
50,The staff.. excellent special thanks to Noah.. The room glorious great view great room.. The location fantastic We went to Shamrock Series Game walked.. Slept like a baby once I got tired after watching the fantastic views outside my window... Thank you
50,The Mandalay Bay is by far the best place we have stayed in Vegas. The food was higher than we expected but prices are rising everywhere. The staff were amazing and very professional at all times. It was a great stay.
50,Mandalay Bay is the perfect resort for a vacation in Vegas. Our room was clean and spacious with a nice view of the mountains. With plenty of dining options a fantastic pool/beach plenty of gaming activities and shopping you don’t even need to leave. We enjoyed the sports book and many bars around the casino for football entertainment and the proximity to Allegiant Stadium the property is fantastic.
50,Mandalay Bay is a fantastic place for couples or family. We went to Vegas to celebrate my fathers 70th birthday and Mandalay Bays rates and quality for what we paid was exceptional. It is clean beautiful and truly an enjoyable experience. Highly recommend!
50,Thank you to the wonderful wedding department hotel staff and the libertine resturant or doing an amazing job of making my daughters wedding a day we all will remember forever! Every detail was handled beautifully and made this nervous momma of the bride so happy! If you are thinking of getting married in Las Vegas I highly recommend them as the place to go! Thank you so very much!!
10,Driven by greed. Nickle and dime you. $12.50 for coffee in your room. $5 in lobby. No maps or instructions. Mini bar if you pick something up to read the contents you bought it. Open fridge to put your own water in - you bought something.
50,Can’t wait to go back and try the Beach pool. Staff and food at Noodle bar is delicious and fresh and the staff are super super friendly and kind. Must use your MGM rewards for Luxor Excalibur and Mandalay Bay.. makes the trip super value!
50,I was in Vegas for a business event that was based at Mandalay Bay. The room was excellent and large and the staff was exceptional from start to finish. I wasn't able to try out the pools as they aren't open at night for some reason(s) though. That was a bit disappointing. Overall great stay.
50,Great location on the strip plenty of restaurants and entertainment options at the hotel friendly staff and best pool party on the strip. The elite king suite with the strip view was amazing. Would definitely stay here again.
30,The convenience cannot be beat if you have a need to visit Allegiant Stadium but this is the only thing this hotel has going for it. The rooms are OK clean and comfortable but imagine the shock when there were two adults staying in 1 room and we were left to deal with 1 bar of soap as the only toiletry item provided by the hotel. I paid in excess of $1k for two night which IS the going rate for this weekend but the devil is in the details. I have not been to a hotel since I was a cheap struggling college student that did not include shampoo/conditioner/SOAPS (plural). The property itself is nothing special there are multiple hotels in the surrounding area that are equivalent or better and I have stayed at several others in the latter category. Stayed at the Venetian on a previous stay actually priced this other hotel for this most recent trip and the price differential was equivalent but the room views cleanliness and experience cannot be compared. I never travel with toiletries and this may seem like a minor issue it disgusted me to use a common bar of soap with 2 adults sharing a room and no shampoo or any other toiletries to speak of being provided given price paid for the room. I will look elsewhere if my travels take me back and if I have an event at the stadium I will just UBER or taxi to and from the event. Extremely disappointed overall
50,We had a great stay. The automated check it and check out was awesome. Service at Libertine Kumi and S Lounge was great. Hotel room was clean. The casino was fun. Hotel is easy to navigate. Easy access to the Raiders stadium. Great value!
10,Valet department is piss poor in customer service.  Be prepared to pay ridiculous fees upward of 200.00 during an event. Expect long wait times and 0 communication. They failed miserably. I will NEVER go back there again. If you want a great experience with valet go to the Encore.
50,First work trip since 2/2020. Mandalay is a nice place to stay with delicious restaurants and huge convention center. Could’ve been more rest rooms on casino floor especially near lobby. Staff was courteous.
10,I signed up for the MGM app to “skip the line” so after landing at around 1:00 pm I checked in while riding to the hotel. After the 3:00 pm normal check in time passed I thought I would get my room. Nope that didn’t happen until around 6:45 pm. Our evening was messed up by the situation. We had reservations for a fancy restaurant but couldn’t change from our travel cloths. We were totally out of place. The staff refused to even investigate or give me any idea whatsoever as to when my room would be ready when I called. They acted like I was inconveniencing them for asking. I generally try to be patient and don’t usually write reviews. Something needs to change with this hotel.
30,Very noisy rooms from pool parties from 1am-3am and during the day. Noise from airport. Great location for allegiant stadium. Very nice staff. Long wait for valle to bring car. Self parking was awesome except when it was closed for sporting event.
20,Guest services treated me as if I was a bother when I had question re: my account. Housekeeping didn't have washcloths on their carts and made no attempt to get any as I asked several times during the day. My concert tickets were sent to another MGM property and Guest services offered no solution until the Box office staff located the missing tickets. In room coffee is $12 which is ridiculous for a Hotel of this status.
50,We came in for the weekend and had a fabulous time in Las Vegas. The Mandalay Bay property is a great stay and very close to Allegiant Stadium. From checkin to checkout we had a fabulous experience with great service and great rooms.
40,We stayed here for a football weekend going to a game at Allegiant Stadium. It is the closest hotel to the stadium and made for an easy walk. Don't love all the fees (resort parking in-room coffee). Room was large had a few good meals at the resort restaurants albeit pricey.
10,Traveled with family had a bad experience wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone  Dirty rooms there were used pajamas and socks in the room ear plugs on floor. Glad that we noticed it before our 1.5 years old son.  Not enough food options for vegetarians buffet place is closed for renovations.  Self parking not conveniently located it’s another end of hotel from the room elevators quite a walk through casino floors with loud music and smoke.  Rude staff didn’t let me stop car near exit to load my luggage whereas had hotel’s limo / valet parking right there.  Never going back there.
50,We attended a raiders football game and was a perfect place to walk to the stadium. The rooms are nice and comfy. We got to enjoy the fish tank experience and house of blues. We will stay here again. I also like the online Check in so we don’t have to stand in line.
50,Mandalay offers 2 of the best restaurant at KUMI and Strip Steak. The casino floor and sportsbook is one of the best in Vegas. If you travel in the summer the 5 pools are a nice break outside. Don't miss the Michael Jackson tribute show
50,Everything was great there wasn't a lot of smokers in the casino which made everything cleaner for me and my team won which made everything better to me hahahahaha but everything was great at the Mandalay Bay from my experience there to the food the atmosphere from GameDay
50,Can’t say enough positives about this exceptional resort. People property amenities dining and casino are all top drawer. Staff is always helpful friendly and engaging. Make you feel welcome and appreciated.
50,We had a great time and it was so beautiful inside. The staff were friendly and got everyone having a blast. It never felt crowded or smelled of smoke. This was my 2nd time and I will be back. Great time
50,This is our third time staying at Mandalay bay and the experience just keeps getting better and better. The attentiveness of the staff and the service overall is top-notch. The food was absolutely phenomenal. We dined at Citizens and Kumi and they were both amazing. We are so happy that the property is getting a new Starbucks closer to the convention center which is super convenient!
40,This was my first time in Vegas rooms were clean pools were awesome. But the bed was uncomfortable and sucks there wasn't a fridge. But it had a big shower and a sweet tub. Hotel/Casino overall was clean. A plus! was their Tram to Excalibur. Definitely was a time saver and better we didn't have to walk all that way.
30,As inflation and prices go up what you get with the state goes down. The fitness center now costs extra. (resort fee covers what then?) the hotels still use waited snack bars that if you even accidentally bump you get charged obscene amounts. no water anywhere on premise (unless you buy a bottle for $10). Rooms are definitely outdated. for what you pay it’s just not worth it anymore.
50,We had a great two night stay. Not a thing to complain about. Our king room had a beautiful view of the strip and the bed was super comfortable. We had excellent service at the front desk the snack shop and the Seaside Cafe.
50,We received an upgrade this time! And what an upgrade it was. Amazing views lots of room to gather in with family and friends. Excellent food and the staff are extremely helpful. Loved every minute of it.
50,My experience staying at Mandalay Bay was wonderful. They always provide great service and the casino has a variety of games and is very clean. The guest services are easy to access as well as their pool. They have an amazing staff that are helpful with all questions or concerns if you have any.
50,I was in Vegas for my birthday and Mandalay Bay exceeded my expectations. From the time we pulled up until we checked out everyone was friendly courteous and very helpful. We'll definitely stay again
50,Walking distance to the stadium and a great experience. As a lifelong Raiders fan this was my 1st opportunity to see a home game. The stadium is fantastic and the Raiders got their 1st win. Tailgating in a casino is fun too!
40,Very clean rooms. There are rooms with great views. They have rooms that have 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. We have two grandchildren that live there and we take them for at least one of the nights that we are there so the 2 bedrooms make it so much easier
30,We chose this resort for the proximity to Allegiant stadium. If the rating was based upon that alone it would get 5 stars. But it isn't. Overall the rooms feel outdated. Be prepared to be charged extra or overcharged for everything. For example a small bottle of suntan lotion that you can purchase for $8 cost $33 onsite!!!!  We stayed on one of the upper floors and whenever you flush the toilet the initial water pressure was extremely loud like a car backfiring loud. Employees were just standing around and were basically indifferent to everyone. Half the staff did not know where anything was within the resort - giving us wrong information.    The good: Proximity to Allegiant Stadium. Easy Check-In.  The bad: Exorbitant prices for goods and upcharge for most things that should have already been included in the Daily Resort Fees.
30,Squeaky bathroom door enough to be super annoying and wake up your spouse if you got in the middle of the night. Weir los humming noise from AC unit. Not a quiet room will probably stay elsewhere next time
30,The resort is beautiful and the staff are friendly and helpful. The casino is so smoky. Restaurant selections are really good. If you are attending an event at the convention center then stay here. It's too much trouble to stay off-site. If you want to get any sleep make sure your room does not face Mandalay Beach/Pools. Sunday night concerts are not fun when you are trying to get sleep for a busy work day!
50,Rooms were clean house keeping staff went above and beyond. We had a very comfortable stay. I wish it was easier to deal with humans there they relied allot on technology for check in check out and keys and it made the process for all three more difficult.
30,Rooms are nice. Location is at the end of the strip which makes it more difficult to get to a lot of the popular venues. Staff is not as attentive as other MGM properties I've stayed at (Mirage). Pool is the best one I've been to in Las Vegas.
50,We like that this is across the highway from the stadium. It’s also nice that they are clean friendly with very nice comfortable accommodations. The restaurants are good too. We already have our next 2 trips booked. Go Raiders!
10,Not all towels in room. Bulbs didn’t work correctly and we were told they would come fix but nobody ever did. Late checkout request for 3 approved but keycards stopped working anyway so we had to get new ones. Restaurant Libertine never brought out our appetizers after asking 3 times and then finally just asking to cancel them. Nobody seemed to care about anything we said or asked for. Every worker pretty much said they will resolve the issue and then did nothing
10,Got locked out of room for over 2hrs right at checkout time when the card reader on the door died. Had to go back & forth from the 8th floor to the front desk multiple times to repeatedly ask for maintenance to come open the door including the housekeeper & housekeeping supervisor both calling maintenance staff directly from their cellphones. Maintenance staff in the hallways joking about going to lunch.
10,Worse experience in Vegas we have ever had. No one ever asked how our stay was or if we needed anything. Spent a lot of money here and no one asked if we needed anything. I mean management. Not one manager was ever around.
50,Nice stay with friendly staff. Room was spacious and clean bed was comfy. Don't touch the minibar or snacks in the room unless you intend to consume the items as they are monitored and automatically charged to your room if moved. Don't touch or use the mini refrigerator for the same reasons.
20,The room was pricey considering the room was very noisy the towels were scratchy the shower was small and the toilet did not flush well. Also the rewards programs makes you take receipts to the rewards counter rather than all options for use tracking automatically like it does for the gambling. Long lines for rewards made this tedious.
50,Our first stay there and we were not disappointed. Everything was more spacious (the room and casino) with a large variety of eateries and shopping. All of their staff were very friendly and very professional.
50,The rooms are very nice and a lot of choices for restaurants which is great. Once I got the hang of things and the layout of the property it was pretty easy getting around. If I was there for personal travel I wouldn’t of liked to of had a more affordable choice of restaurants. Everything seem to be pretty expensive.
30,Like much of Vegas this hotel is no different. $12 dollar beers. Funky smelling rooms. Some problem with sewage towards the arena. If you like fair service and food for high price this your place. Place is aging looks the same as 20 years ago. Everything is priced through the roof.
20,We had a two night stay in Mandalay's 2 bedroom King suite. The check in process was pretty seamless-so far so good. Vegas has this down generally speaking. When we entered our room we notices a junky mini-fridge sitting in the hallway. It was old and beat up. In the master bedroom of the suite the makeup mirror was hanging off the wall and barely worked. It is such an obvious thing to maintenance but no one bothered. I had occassion to pick up something that fell under the sink and saw how filthy the floor was. On Saturday morning of our stay the Harmann Kartmann speaker bar under one of the televisions in the living area went on and blasted AD/DC's-Shook Me All Night Log. We could not get it to turn off and had to call down to engineering. We waited and no one came so we left for the pool. It had finally turned itself off by then. No note or voicemail following up on the issue was left so we had no idea if it was fixed or attended to. We had a Sunday checkout and we asked for an additional hour to check out (check out is 11am). We had a later afternoon flight and had spent over $3600 for two nights. We were told no promptly. The last issue I have is the amount of prostitution going on in the Hazel Bar at the base of the elevators and other areas of the casino. It is not even managed by hotel security. When we were going to our room two prostitutes jumped in the elevator. Well you need a key card to go to your floor and your card works for your floor at that time of day. They had no help coming from anyone in the elevator but it feels unsafe. Then the Raider Nation descended on Mandalay on Sunday due to the proximity of Allegiant Stadium. To say the clientele declined even further is an understatement. They are obnoxious and downright aggressive. Not the classy hotel it once was. The only amenity that is worth anything is the pool. The servers and pool attendants were lovely. Don't stay at Mandalay. Spend your hard earned vacation dollars elsewhere.
50,A break from the daily stress of work so my girlfriend and I took a 5 day get away to watch some shows eat lots of great foods and play some slots and have tons of fun while doing it. Well worth the trip
40,Great experience and hotel stay was amazing besides the free play download myself and my family enjoyed our stay and would consider returning. I do fell the hotel should over discounted valet and easier ways to get free money download
20,Very Smokey issue checking in mosquito bites from beds in room felt dirty bars on windows outside room beyond noisy at night hotel staff not knocking before entering room hotel didn’t feel personable.
30,The room was nice but their hidden fees are nonsense..I drank two beers from the mini bar and one bottle of fiji water..I was charged $14 for one a can of beer (which I guess I expected). The crazy charge was the $24 I was charged for one fiji water. $12 would have pissed me off but $24 for one bottle should be illegal. They prey on the guests who are hungover and are going to go straight to the water when they wake up with a pounding headache.
30,Be prepared to pay extra for every little thing down to opening the fridge (that’s $50). Parking is extra. There’s a coffee pot in the room but if you want to make coffee in it you have to pay for that too
50,Worth it all expensive at some points but def worth it. Love the view loved the pools and the wedding chapel also the restaurants are amazing ! Sports bar was the best ! Didn’t see anyone winning in the casino but it’s hit or miss.
50,We were able to see Santana at Hard Rock visit the Aquarium and Michael Jackson Experience all in the same building. We were able to easily walk over to the Luxor to eat and there were more experience. It was a perfect location!
50,the staff is very helpful and friendly. surroundings are gorgeous. quality place to stay. many options in dining and pools. great good. very nice casino. furnishings are beautiful. again staff was exceptional.
50,I absolutely love Mandalay Bay… the location is perfect the hotel is clean & the restaurants & bars & very good. We watched the game at House of Blues…the service and food was so good dinner was at the noodle shop… another good choice.
30,Shower was clogged and water cme up to my ankle everytime I showered. Bathroom smelled urine which I was not and housekeeper was not able to make it go away. Wall outlet was coming apart. Electronic locker wasn't working... on and on.
20,"Our group of 6 were very excited to see Santana at the House of Blues which is located at Mandalay. I must say the front desk was courteous enough to offer us rooms on the same floor as you cannot access other floors with your room key. The problem was on floor 16. At no time did we have good water pressure in the shower and most of the time it was either a scalding hot or drippy cold stream.  We did not want to move after we were all settled so we agreed that the resort fees would be removed. Some were removed but we automatically received one the last day after we checked out.  The room itself was ok. King bed was comfortable however there were absolutely no amenities. You expect SOMETHING from a hotel that is billed as luxury other than a few tiny bottles of hair products. No usable refrigerator without a price no microwave no coffee maker and free coffee no robes or slippers no washcloths.  Mandalay is not really within easy walking distance to a market so the small store on the main floor had ridiculously priced items such as bananas for $3.25 each and smallish waters for $6.  I think the biggest surprise was at the pool area. If you want a chair in the ""sand"" area you must pay $75 for the chair and $75 for an umbrella. Off that beachy area the free chairs are all crammed together and in full sun during most of the day.  We managed to go on a 4 day vacation and have fun with friends but have stayed at other hotels on the strip much nicer and more generous with extras."
50,I have stayed here many times. It may not be the fanciest but it doesn't look run down crowded and sad like some of the other casinos on the strip. Its a more business like crowd and I appreciate that. The pools are awesome and the casino floor is clean and well attended. Almost all of the team that works there is very friendly to customers and seems concerned about your enjoyment and satisfaction
30,Hotel Room very nice and big. However the shower had mold on the floor and corners. The water pressure was SUPER BAD to the point where there was no water coming out at all. Water in the shower will go super hot and then super cold. Bath Tub had hairs!  They had a coffee maker in the room but you have to pay 13 dollars for a 10oz Keurig coffee really?!?!?!  Even the cheapest hotels give you coffee for free!
20,Business convention at this property. Spent 4 days at site underwhelmed with entire experience. Convention center and staff (housekeeping and maintenance) were very nice professional high quality. That’s where the positives end.    Property overcharges for all facets of stay. Couldn’t even use the mini fridge in the room without additional charges. Wifi spotty and low quality at best. Meals drastically overpriced bottle of iced tea at “convenience “ store in lobby almost $6 small can of pringles in room $11. Additional charges for almost every service and basic items. STAY AWAY from mini bar my wife accidentally opened cabinet door (not the fridge) and they put a $50 charge on room for “personal use” of fridge that I had to have removed. Drinks 300% above retail and dealers very unfriendly. Try a different property.
20,Went here for a conference. The conference rate made it reasonable to stay there when you took into account the cost of transportation.    The amount of smoke and extra cost that has to be managed around being in the resorts is something you always have to think about.    Would rather there was a part of the convention center that was focused on business travel and for folks that were working a conference if they're going to sell those parts of the facility.    Smoking (Weed and Cigarettes) is very pronounced in Vegas this isn't necessarily a Mandalay thing but they're not really doing anything much about it.
20,My stay on this property was less than what I had hoped for and for what I paid. The value has gone down hill. From dirty shower stalls to uninviting spa attendants old gym treadmills that don't work and even a less than convenient ride-share location (that has moved once again). I don't have any plans to return to this property any time soon. They have squeezed every penny out of you and no longer offer any sort of guest experience. Sad.
20,Hotel offered a discounted rate to upgrade to a suite on the 57th floor as we were here on our honeymoon. The suite 57-235 was dated with sticky carpets and smelling of smoke. We were given no overview of the hotel facilities or how to use the room facilities. The upgrade only offered a larger room. No other real perks eg coffee tea or water for the room. The ac was very loud and my wife found the pillows uncomfortable. We called the reception to ask for different pillows but was told that the hotel didn’t offer any other option. The hotel has a cardio area for free but to use the gym is an extra $25 per day per person and this did not include access to the jacuzzi or steam rooms (rip off). Staff were generally friendly but it felt like no one knew how other areas of the hotel worked outside their area. Wave pool charged $50 per sun bed and $50 per umbrella for the better sections. The free areas were packed with no personal space. The pools were ice cold and if you wanted to use a rubber ring on the lazy river you either had to buy your own or rent one for $20. No breakfast was offered at the hotel as part of the room booking and there was not buffet option. The advise was to go to another hotel. The suite did offer complimentary access to the foundation room but we were told that it didn’t open until Thursday but we noticed it was open from Wednesday another miscommunication. Overall I felt there was not benefit to upgrading and for the extra money I would have preferred to have stayed in a nicer newer more lively hotel on the strip.
10,rooms went downhill.  my bathroom smelled like dahmers apartment and the air bent was so dusty that when i turned the AC on there were constant large pieces of dust falling down. not to mention the first night my AC didn’t even work. probably because the air vents were so dirty? i woke up sweating and had the thermostat set to 65 degrees!  my shower did not drain it immediately spat up some gunk and filled up. disgusting!  i was provided 1 hand towel. there were two sinks. every hotel i stay at always provided at least TWO hand towels.  prices for the available food room service / mini bar items & restaurants inside the casino / hotel were SO expensive it should be illegal. ridiculous!  not to mention i used to actually win on the slot machines - this time there was zero winning.  ALSO the working girls that hang at your casino / hotel what the hell? there are so many women trying to hustle their prostitution out it is unpleasant to even go out. can’t enjoy a meal and drink without a girl thinking they can get me to pay for sex.  i’ve stayed here plenty of times in the past and it was never this bad. what happened? never again.
50,Our favorite place to stay. The service is fantastic the pool is great food and drink options are excellent. Location is easy in and out access to main highways and airport. Everything you need for a great stay in Vegas.
50,My stay at Mandalay Bay was great. Went there super early on a Sunday and was able to check in early. I was helped by Parissa and she was kind and friendly. I had to share that as check in employees are not too friendly most of the time. I had the prime rib dinner at Citizens as most my Mandalay trips as it's less than $50 and the portions are big. Got a Fat Tuesday at Mandalay Place a shopping area leading into Luxor. Gambled a bit and made some sportsbook wagers. I enjoy how this casino feels spacious and not overcrowded.
10,I was the victim of a crime in their hotel and security evicted me from my room. Security advised me it was the hotel's policy. I lost $170 for the cost of the room. They kicked me out at three of the morning. I walked to 4 different hotels in the middle of the night before I found a hotel that wasn't fully booked.
50,The rooms were clean and spacious. The hotel had many restaurant choices and entertainment. If you have kids they will definitely enjoy as well as the aquarium reef in the hotel( reasonable pricing). Amazing pool area which included a lazy river. Overall Nice family spot. Staff is very friendly and helpful
50,We flew in from Dallas and landed at 9am. Arrived at Hotel and was able to check in early. Spent the morning/afternoon at the pool area. Staff were extremely polite and helpful. Later that day we attended the concert and after party which was held at Light Night Club. Amazing experience
40,It was nice and we enjoyed our stay. The machines were not paying but the pool experience is always great! We had a great time with a MGM show at the Luxor called American Got Talent. Great acts and lots of fun.
50,The staff are very knowledgeable friendly the hotel is very well staffed there’s so much to do and everything is at your fingertips. You don’t even have to leave the hotel. Everything you need is right in the premises. Our housekeeper was amazing!
50,I was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved this hotel and casino. It was so clean the rooms were spacious and my view was great! The pools were not crowded the staff were pleasant and answered all questions. Check in and check out we’re quick and simple. I would definitely recommend you staying here. Great bang for your buck
30,Have stayed here previously before Covid it is not the same. Prices have gonevup drastically while service is mediocre. MGM seems to be more concerned about social issues than their client's stay. Probably try somewhere else in Vegas next time.
50,Best trip I’ve ever had in Vegas!!!! We had an amazing casino host Andrew Cook! Nothing short of a great trip!!! Also go see Michael Jackson One!! It was a great show!!! We loved the atmosphere every aspect of it!
40,Clean an convenient if you’re attending a venue at Allegiant stadium. Nice pool an lazy river. Not bad overall just lacks some room amenities (free water or use of fridge without being charged). It could use some more dining options passed 1 am too.
10,Used shampoo in the room. Front desk was not disgusted. They only offered to bring up more. I asked them if they understood why I was reporting a used shampoo bottle. They did not and sounded like they didn't care and wanted me off the phone. Door didn't lock to my room. It took two calls and an hour to swap rooms because the first person forgot about me when I told them I was really hungry and wanted to swap rooms asap. When I asked to speak with a manager to make sure they knew of my issues they never called me. I asked several times over. They decided to call me when I was leaving my room at check out time. They knew I said I was checking out and chose that time to call me. They were suppose to call me on my cell phone once I landed at home. They have not called me. All of this is suppose to be noted in my file so they can reference to see I did try to tell them about these issues.
20,Not a fun stay. Beautiful facility and clean but staff was very unwelcoming. Upon check in room was not ready but they took my money and said they would text when room was….never received text. Waited in beach area and bought a 32 oz pina colada for $28 and $100 chair rental. When I called on room after waiting 2 hours past check in time they let me go to room where I promptly locked myself out with an accidental door shut. 2 maids refused to assist third would not make eye contact but said she would call security (that never came) . Fridge has $50 use sensor for opening- coffee cup is $12 (where any other hotel in the country offers complimentary.) Casino conveniently located in middle of everywhere you need to walk- So plan to get smoke stenched and headache if you are smoke sensitive. After 50th walk through their plan worked and I tried my 1st attempt at a slot where I was quickly kicked out by A-Hole security guard because my 18 year old spectacular was with me. Not a fan will never come back!
50,We have stayed at Manadalay Bay every year since Grand Opening - it never disappoints. Great check-in service friendly staff clean rooms. If your looking for an awesome experience that’s not in the middle of the strip this is the place.
10,I was moved into 3 different rooms and was downsized cause they didn’t have a clean room to put me with clean towels. I complained about it to front desk multiple times and the only thing they can do was take off resort fees but that never happened so I will not be back to that hotel nor would I recommend it to anyone
40,Great resort.. only thing was slight vibrating humming sound through the night on floor 3 which made sleeping a little difficult.. other then that the room was great and the resort seemed really clean! Staff was pleasant!
50,I’ll find somewhere else to stay next time I still can’t get over the unexplainable charges!!! This is outrageous and the manager didn’t help at all they just made excuses but the room was nice and very clean
40,Mandalay Bay hotel is amazing and I actually won on the slots. Def would stay here again. Pool is amazing. Rooms were clean. Great location right next to 4 seasons. I’m a mlife member and I love the comp program.
30,First time staying at mandalas bay. Rooms were very nice clean and maintained. Pools were very nice with assortment from the lagoon pools to wave pool to lazy river. We rented cabanas each day and that made it enjoyable. Cabana service was very good. Disappointed in MGM Rewards offers. I have always had some or most of stay comped but not this time. My gambling activities have not changed but apparently MGM Rewards has. I have stayed for less at The Bellagio The Venetian and others. Have been to vegas about 40 times all pretty much at MGM properties b7t next year I may have to make the move to Total Rewards.
10,My vacation was not fun due to the crowded nature of the Mandalay Bay. I couldn't eat at any of the restaurants. My family was disappointed in the pool hours being too short. The rooms were not great but just ehh.
50,The atmosphere in the casino both Friday and Saturday was a whole vibe definitely had lots of fun! Lots of options to go grab a drink and to have dinner pool was amazing and nightclub was very good and crowd was electric
20,Needs renovation. Towels were threadbare with threads literally hanging from the seams. You're not allowed to put anything in the refrigerator and if you want anything cold they will rent you one for $50/day. Loud concert outside made sleep the night of 9/21 impossible. Would not stay again.
30,Hi been going to Las Vegas for the last 5 yrs straight every September. Was very disappointed in Mandalay Bay always like staying there Not this time in September My room wasn’t ready until after 6 pm. They where packed which the short staff couldn’t handle. Housekeeping only cleaned our room once. Key didn’t work etc
50,Went down for a friends birthday and there anniversary all in the same weekend and we wanted them to experience Mandalay bay like we do. We all left very happy with the services we received and will stay there every time we visit Vegas..
10,It has gone completely downhill. There are other choices…pick one of those. We witnessed doemnstic violas twice our room was next to a large barking dog we  Got Downgraded but for no reduction in cost you can’t get a cup of coffee before 7AM the concierge has no options for you the pool is beat up and unkept stay away.
10,Not worth the time rude employees argue and direct adults like they are children. Many staff very unfamiliar with the hotel. No Ev charger Delano has one but it’s 110 so you have to be on it two to three days
20,This is solely about the pool/beach area. Mostly b cause I’m hoping someone at the hotel reads the reviews. I’m not having any luck reaching anyone here to discuss.    First I can’t say enough about the changes. We come here at least twice a year. Since our last visit they have replaced all the loungers and adjusted the paid areas - adding some in key areas added lockers to the restrooms added a bar between the lazy river and wave pool etc. I’m told the pool has a new manager that instituted some of the changes. Nice to see some updating and upgrading!    But….the water temperature is barely tolerable. We’ve been here two days and have never had it as cold in the twenty plus years we’ve been coming. We’ve been the first weekend the pools opened and the last before they closed. I’m told they only heat during the winter. And not during the summer. It isn’t summer…so. I asked someone in business attire and he smiled and said it’s heated today. Nope!    And…the sand is full of debris. I understand that this the fault of guests not using the provided trash cans. However it would appear that the sand hasn’t been raked in quite awhile.
10,Most sides of the hotel are just plain noisy. You get the airport noise or loud construction machinery noises in the mountain view. They made some sort of arrangement as additional parking site for events at Alligient stadium that works against hotel guests that self park. Lastly attended a 50th anniversary wedding and reception at Four Seasons...poorly done the rude staff did not take care of old folks in escorting them from the falls to four seasons no seating arrangments was go hunt over 30 or so tables for your names. Do not cater your special event (like wedding) here.
30,Resort fees right now almost $45 each. Two of the three pools were completely unusable because of the drastic cold temperatures. And now they’re charging you $20 a day to park overnight in a casino that you’re staying in even with a $45 resort fee. Going to make you go to a different hotel that offers free parking light treasure Island. Just not worth all the fees. And with pools you can’t even use.
10,Imagine: You book 1 night in the Mandala Bay resort with a king size bed minibar coffee maker functioning toilet etc because you know you are coming from a 12-hour overseas flight and need some rest for the next day.  Reality: You´re tired park in the Mandala Bay parking garage walk 20 min to reception stand in line (11 pm on a Saturday night) for 25 min get a room (but not in the Mandala Bay that you booked but in the Delano (because it belongs to the Mandala Bay)walk back 20 min (close to our parking spot) get to your room.  Room looks like a cleaned up reserve room. No coffeemaker no minibar broken toilet flusher.Anyhow  it´s midnight and you just need to sleep.We left at 6 am in the morning and paid almost $ 400 for the room(beforehand). This is just fraud.If you can  avoid all MGM resort hotels in Las Vegas.Very dissapointing
10,Year after year they continue to have problems with rooms and the check in check out experience. I was given a room that hadn’t been cleaned yet and took one hour to get cleaned the room that was ready. During the check in process the attendant literally left the stand to help somebody else and left me to wait. The managers didn’t seem to care
10,I stay in hotels 100 days per week. This was the worst experience ever. I walked into the shower to discover the last guest’s hair on the walls. The sink was dirty with makeup. Room was clearly not cleaned before my arrival. The front desk basically did nothing when I politely mentioned it. Then the bell man was the rudest human I have met. Other guests were laughing at how absurdly rude he was. Horrible.
50,We stopped in Vegas for two nights on our way to the Grand Canyon. The resort is conveniently located especially coming from the airport late at night! The parking garage lets you know how many spaces are available on each level and even what parts of the floor has spots available.    We had a Staywell room. I really enjoyed the air purifier and water filter in the bathroom. The room was spacious and clean.    By far the best part of the Resort for me was the lazy river. I brought my own floats from home and was able to use the inflation station right by the lazy river to blow them up. They charge ~$30 for a tube! The water was a little chilly but perfect once you were in for the hot day. I think I floated on the river for hours. There is also wait service to the beach chairs. That was handy for my friend who did not feel the need to float with us!    Overall I'd totally stay there again. I even won a little bit at the casino!
10,We booked/confirmed a king suite at Delano but on arrival we were given two queens at Mandalay Bay. The cost differential was hundreds of dollars when we booked months in advance but rates went way up due to MMA fight so we were told we we could not be given any refund. They did waive resort fees but when I tried to use the gym they said it would cost $25 if I wanted to do anything other than cardio. Unreal lack of customer service or accommodation.
30,Incredible lack of room and associated amenities such as fitness equipment choice and quality. Had to pay for in room coffee and then machine didn’t work. Outside music disturbing if you want to sleep. Far from other things and tram involved lots of walking afterwards.
40,Table to high on weekend for a min at $50 sports good is always nice maybe newer main tv soon I hope. Food at Lepo was just ok every were else was great. Service was great everywhere. Even the nice lady that helped at sports book was great.
40,Out of many trips this was by far the worst stay I’ve had and during the hours I gambled it was nearly impossible to get a drink this time if the few problems would have been resolved it would have been great it just seemed that it wasn’t anyones concern to take care of them
40,Love staying here. Enjoy the pools wish they would have longer hours and stay open later in the season. Location was great for the activities we had planned. Only downfall which its almost everywhere now is there is a fee for everything.
10,My son has epilepsy told hotel prior and during stay. Receptionist was in a mood because they were busy said room wasn't ready no rooms available when there were. Put us in room after 4. My son was starting to fall a sleep very loud music from pool couldn't sleep. Had to switch rooms during the night didn't get to sleep after 11 up almost 24 hours.
50,This is a great hotel it’s amazing it has so many restaurants and activities inside you don’t even need to go outside of this resort. The cleanliness of our room and hotel was great and it’s so easy to move around from the inside to different resorts they’re all connected!!! Amazing will definitely stay again!!
50,Raiders game can you watch the game the location is near the allegiant stadium and my MGM awards this year hotel ladies location was perfect food the noodle restaurant and everything was great had a great time highly recommend that’s the place to stay to watch the raider game accommodations are great
20,Paid $430 per night. Then a $50 resort fee per dad. Was then told I couldn’t use the gym unless I paid another $25 per visit. Was then told I couldn’t use the spa unless I booked a $200 treatment. Both are advertised as amenities I could use ABC I have used them in the past without extra charges. Digital key failed constantly. E-mailed customer service no one bothered to reply. They treat their customers with contempt.
40,Went to Vegas for a wedding the service was exceptional. The officiant who performed the service was out of this world. Also staff was great location great and food was excellent. The Micheal Jackson show was nice also.
30,The shower walls were dirty and still had hand prints in them.Even after I had housekeeping come clean the room she still didn’t clean the shower walls. The bathroom counters were not cleaned linens on bed did not get changed she only piled linens up. Makes me wonder if the sheets were ever clean to begin with when I checked in
20,We booked a king suite months ago and when we checked in there would none left. Also housekeeping would not abide by the dnd sign and argued with me while I was trying to work. Loud yelling at night.
50,My Fiancé and I had an amazing first time in Vegas and Mandalay Bay was a huge part in making the trip perfect. I will only stay at MGM properties due to the amazing offers that are hard to pass up.    The BIGGEST factor for me is cleanliness and I did a lot of research and it seemed everyone spoke highly with how clean and well kept Mandalay Bay is. It’s true!! It was very clean and very well kept. Our room was perfect and I was VERY happy with my stay.    The concierge team was a huge help in setting up a birthday surprise for my fiancé. Every single employee we interacted with at Mandalay Bay was professional genuine and great!    Their casino floor (I’m a slot player) was pretty decent and ended up being my preferred casino to gamble in after visiting most of the casinos on the strip during my 4 night stay.    Although Mandalay Bay is not in the center of strip where a lot of people like to be they still offer a free Tram that brings you to the bridge that connects Excalibur and New York New York. In short Mandalay Bay is close enough to every other Casino on the strip if you don’t mind hoping on a Tram for a short ride and doing a little bit of waking but far enough so that the casino floor does not become overrun and overcrowded by pedestrians asking for money or trying to escape the heat.    I also saw several celebrities during my stay and it makes sense as to why they stay at Mandalay Bay. It’s a very clean well kept beautiful resort that’s not smack dab in the middle of the strip with thousands of people walking in and out alllllll day.
30,The three Casino bars had out of control crowds yelling and screaming to loud music celebrating Mexico’s Independence. So loud it caused people on the casino floor to do the same as well as dancing all around the slots where I was trying to enjoy my gambling experience! Will not be returning to this venue any time soon!
50,The rooms are very nice customer service is very nice very clean place. It's not far from the Raider stadium at all. My only Complaint would be the location. It's far away from the strip and shopping. But other then that it's very nice place to stay.
50,We really enjoyed our stay. The staff was friendly and helpful even when things got chaotic because the Raiders played at home. The room was really nice and clean . The food was great and the service in the resteraunts were exceptional.
50,Very nice hotel. Only bad thing I will say is the location. Far from middle of strip but they have stage Tran service that takes you closer to the strip. I will recommend and will be coming back. Very soon
30,I have always enjoyed staying at Mandalay Bay but in the last couple of years it is showing its age. It needs to be upgraded. Also the customer service needs to improve. That has changed over the last couple of years too.
50,Loved the pool area with the Lazy River!  Very nice beautiful and clean rooms!  The service from the front desk to the bell man to the valet was all friendlyhelpful and convenient. Easy access from from to pool area.
50,A wonderful clean friendly resort and excellent customer service first time we stayed at Mandalay Bay resort and we weren’t disappointed loved it so much! The staff so friendly and nice the food was delicious and we even had room service which was was spectacular! Big portions and very reasonable and fast! We love all MGM resorts and Mandalay Bay was top notch! The rooms were so clean and the beds so comfortable and the pillows are always important for me and they were perfect! Yep another great trip in Las Vegas!
50,Loved this hotel. Very clean and service is great. A ton of restaraunts bars and shops that you really dont even need to leave the property. Had a cool band playin in the main area and guys playin acoustic at other various bars. The pool area is super cool. Feel like your in the carribean somewhere. Only downside was the sports book was super jammed on sunday cuz the raiders were playing and the stadium is right across the street. Sent the wifey to the spa and was looking forward to some good football watching and betting and had to stand for the most part. Not really their fault tho. Would highly recommend
50,The staff was AMAZING.... Everywhere in the resort !!! We loved our room the distinct smell of the resort the food and the people! It was quite pricey but it is Vegas and you get what you pay for.. also there was a lot of different things going on that I was unaware of when I booked our dates so the rates were especially high when we were there. Overall we loved it and would stay there again FOR SURE !
30,We went to a concert the room was dirty when entering the room and that light switch not working didn’t give us much time to get ready. It was an inconvenience. When asked if we can get another room they said that by that time they most likely fixed the light switch we ended up staying in the same room but they didn’t come till 4-5 hrs later. Inconvenience
50,Great hotel with lots available and food was really good. Don’t fall for the “VIP” tables at the foundation room but do go and check out the view! Overall great experience and would stay again! Make sure to learn about the tram as it’s not the same as the monorail.
10,They couldn't care less about their guests. Check in was AFTER 5 and not the room i reserved. Room next door was pulling an all-nighter-called security but they gave a warning and then never checked back-which they would have heard they ignored the warning. Coffee maker was broken. Rude staff.    I'll never stay here again.
40,Rooms were great however the touch sensitive snacks for sale make it worrisome that you’ll knock something over on the snacks. Also no refrigerator because it’s full of drinks for sale for exorbitant prices. Other than that the room was nice.
50,Clean rooms the restraints had good food and the michael Jackson show was amazing. By far the best cirque de soleiI show I have seen I can’t wait to go back!  Staff is friendly and helpful and the gambling was great!
40,Clean spacious room over looking the pool area. Lots to do in this hotel. Friendly staff. The elevators were a good walk from the parking lot. The aquarium was a bit steep on the price for what it was.
50,Went for the weekend with another couple to the Raiders Game. Enjoyed the Morrea Beach Club both Friday and Saturday. Good music and the vibe was great. We had dinner on property both nights which was fantastic
10,We booked the Elite Suite for 2 nights  When we checked in they did not inform us we had been downgraded to a normal room and then basically said there was nothing they could do about the room. They originally offered us to just comp the resort fee and parking when the room we paid for was over $800 a night    Would not recommend
20,Could of had more workers at the front desk. Wouldn't give my brother info when he had no key to get to my room. They never called my room. He slept on stairs and someone stole his backpack. Such bad service.
10,Housekeeping department is a mess front desk professionalism is 0. A moth stayed with us for the entire stay and even after gassing the room with bug spray. Unable to switch room and gum on the bathroom door
50,The hotel was clean friendly and affordable! The beds slept comfortably and plenty of space! Location was convenient to airport and other amenities! Keep up the good work! Could’ve won more machines were too tight!!
50,The Mandalay Bay is close to the airport it has a lazy river pool and a pool with waves.  I also remember breathing in a pleasant healthy scent somewhere in the main area of the hotel.  The Mandalay free tram takes you to the Luxor and Excalibur.  The floor to ceiling window on the 25 th floor room faced the airport.  The bed and linen was comfortable I slept very well.
50,I enjoyed my stay at this property.    I used the mobile check-in system which worked really well for in and out privileges at the parking garage and to open the hotel room door with my cellphone. Checking in with my phone meant that I didn't have to wait to check in and really didn't have any interaction with the resort's staff while staying here.    Got a nice room with a great view looking right down the strip. The room was very clean and well maintained. The bathroom had a clean tub and a shower.    The room also had ironing supplies a decent blow dryer and an in-room safe. As stated by other people the fridge is stocked with items which are tracked by motion sensors so if you move things around to put stuff in the fridge you will probably be charged as if you consumed the items you moved.    My floor was really quiet during my stay. I was here during a string of 100+ degree days so the water activities at this property were really appreciated.    If you do stay here know that this is an MGM property - so they charge for parking unless you are a certain level of member (I believe if you are military you get that level of membership for free - just ask at the rewards desk). Also the beverage charges off the gaming floor are insane. A regular size bottle of water here costs $7. So I suggest that you bring your food and drinks to the property. Mandalay Bay is also at the far south end of the strip - so not centrally located but you can take the tram to some of the other properties that are more northward.    That said one night including the resort fee was under $90. It was a decent price considering the water activities and how relatively nice the hotel was. I would consider staying here again at the right price.    I would definitely stay here again.
50,Excellent Time and service. I was at Mandalay for 1 week at a conference. I am so glad the conference was at Mandalay Bay!! Hope it is here next year also. We never left the resort the whole time we were there.
30,I had multiple mosquitoes in my room when I arrived and there was a moth in my room every day. Disgusting. Didn’t know where they were coming from. Loud undulating noise I could hear from my room 24/7 (I was on 3rd floor). It made it very hard to sleep.
10,We decided to try out the Mandalay Bay and found out quickly that it was a big mistake. Poor customer service dirty rooms and loud… don’t expect to get sleep if you go there on a Friday night. It’s loud when there are concerts. We had an early morning event and didn’t get any sleep. The staff was not helpful.
50,I truly enjoy the Mandalay Bay resort.  But the sleep quality that my lady and I experienced was awful. The walls are very thin. My girlfriend has been traumatized by the domestic violence she witnessed through hearing the beating and suffering of the woman next door. Yes there was also a baby crying but that’s not really a big deal or deal breaker. I wish the Mandalay nothing but success. This recent trip gave my girlfriend the wrong impression of the resort.
40,Good stay for sure draw back (for us as we like to bring our own food and drinks) is that you have pay for fridge in the room price starts at $50 per night……. We didn’t pay thankfully we had a cooler and that’s what we used to keep drinks and food cool.
50,Everyone was super helpful and friendly throughout the casino and hotel. Room was spacious and had a big bathroom. Cleanliness was on point. There was a good size market/convenient store right by the elevators to the room which was great for snacks. Also there was a coffee bar/ grab and go right off the elevators as well. Great for just wanting coffee and a croissant to take back to the room to enjoy in your pjs. Would definitely recommend and will be going back.
20,Air conditioning barely works and you cannot cool the rooms down. Walls are paper thin. Casino floor is dated dark and old. The place needs to be updated as it was charging premium prices for a very old look:
50,Had a great time at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. I highly recommend Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and definitely plan on returning to Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino for all my future gambling endeavors.
30,$12 for a K-cup coffee in the room $20 for a large bottle of water.    Seabreeze restaurant charges $20 for a breakfast with old hash browns and sausage that have been sitting in a buffet warmer. And what can only be instant coffee. Denny's is fine dining compared to this place.    Rooms are decent staff is ok (except a few of the bell staff who were AWESOME and helpful).
50,Great experience overall. Will stay here again next year. Tram connected to Hotel was the best to allow us to move up the strip and explore.    Everyone working at the hotel were exceptional and really made our first time trip to Las Vegas special.
50,Always great to stay at Mandalay Bay for concerts and events at Allegiant Stadium (sound sucks there). Every level of comfort and care at my stay. Would definitely recommend and will continue to stay there. Rewards is confusing.
30,We used to love taking our kids here but has gone downhill. Bedside outlets don’t work nor did tv. New room key system does not give you access to your friend’s tower if they arent in yours. You have to pay $12 to take coffee cup from room to fill. At almost $300/ night room coffee would be nice. On the positive side bed comfy and quick check- in. Unlikely wont stay again.
50,From the front desk staff to the bar and longe staff. All very friendly and helpful. The resort is very clean. Entertainment was. great! Food was great. View was great!!  So close to the Allegiant stadium that we could walk to the concert
30,Disappointed that we were nickeled and dined for everything (can only use a mini fridge for a charge) lack of cleanliness lack of customer service/care everything is expensive without the quality to back the price. Enjoyed the lazy river very much.
50,Loved the convention rates and staff was great plenty of restaurants to eat at valet was helpful and housekeeping was effecient. Didnt like the shut down when there was an event across the street for a concert
10,They don’t even give you coffee for the room. That’s $12 if you want to make room coffee.  I don’t mind the price of the room or gambling away some dollars. But nothing and I mean nothing is accessible for you. Can’t reach a concierge so no help with anything. Everything automated to save a buck. So now you’ll save a lot more because next time will be a different hotel after all these years of Mandalay stays
10,For a hospitality based industry the customer service at the front desk put a negative experience on the whole stay. And to top it off the beds were extremely uncomfortable. It was disappointing to not have a buffet but it is what it is in that regard.
20,The hotel has clearly gone downhill from a maintenance perspective imo. Casino and hallways seemed really dark (compared to past visits) which helped cover some of that up. The room furnishing themselves were ok but things like stuck doors ironing boards not opening loose plumbing fixtures and clogged up shower heads lowers the score. Not that I am cheap but parking costs (here and in all of Vegas) has gone through the roof. Also it is a bit much to have to pay to make a cup of coffee in the room. You also don't get to use the nice workout room even though you pay a resort fee.    While the facilities were very disappointing to me the big positive was the people. Virtually all the people we interacted with (from valet bell housekeeping restaurant casino...) were all very nice and helpful. If we return they would be the reason why. But as of right now any return trip to Vegas will probably be at another hotel group. (BTW we stayed one night at the Conrad at Resorts World and found that to be very nice...of course it is new also which helped)
50,Stayed at this hotel for the HR Tech Conference and it was amazing! Great room great service. Great location! The price you pay per night is definitely worth the stay. Will be staying here again for future trips to Vegas!
50,Glad we stayed at Mandalay since we were going to a concert on the weekend very convenient to be staying close to the new stadium! Clean rooms nice décor and friendly staff! .. Great ambience and well kept Hotel!
30,We came to the Mandalay Bay to celebrate our honeymoon and told the front desk as much. The Mandalay Bay (as well as restaurants in the MGM group which knew about our celebrations) made no effort to make our trip special.    On top of that a convention at the Mandalay Bay had reserved literally every restaurant and bar in the hotel making it impossible to enjoy the facilities.    While the Mandalay Bay was a nice overall stay for a regular vacation I deeply regret spending my honeymoon and thousands of dollars at your resort.
40,Look I know Vegas is about $$$.  But when a room costs as much as Mandalay Bay does I think a couple of complimentary bottles of water goes a long way.  The mini bar costs are ridiculous. Charging $22 for 1 bottle of water?! Pure greed.  It's the little things that are done for guests that go a long way.
20,Don't expect anything from this hotel. Bring a lot of money. And prepare to walk far for just a cup of coffee. Strip steak is not the best steak in the world go somewhere else. Nothing to offer for seniors. Can't even get someone to open the front door while struggling with luggage. Won't be back!
50,Beautiful property and a great location if you are attending an event at Allegient Stadium. Walk across the Hacienda bridge and you are there. The pool area is secluded and spacious you don't feel you are on the Vegas strip. The restaurants were excellent I recommend reservations well in advance as we did. Staff throughout was always helpful and friendly. Great overall experience.
10,2 bedroom suite was way overpriced for being a rewards member plus it had a sewer gas odor!!!! Also 2 chairs in living room area were broken. As a frequent Las Vegas visitor I will not be back to Mandalay Bay!!!!!!
50,Everything was perfect from beginning to end. Upon arrival Elvie greeted us with a warm smile and was very accommodating. Rooms were very clean and relaxing. Loved the whole vibe there. We will definitely be back.
50,The lazy river was fun to float in the wave pool and other pools were not crowded and were lively the spa was very relaxing and enjoyable and the restaurant selection was great. The casino was not overly crowded.
50,The place was amazing and classy ambiance👌😊 All the employee are so nice and always helping at anytime! Rooms are amazing especially the resort pools was very memorable experience! Great place for vacation especially for the couple and family!😊
50,The room was nice and clean housekeeping team very nice and helpful I will definitely come back to this hotel I really recommend it you won’t regret it the Pool’s are the best part they have it all if you come with your kids they will enjoy it and get tired lol.
10,Paid for early check in. ended up waiting f for 4 hours until our room was ready. requested a pool view and got a view of the airport. digital keys wouldn't work and we got locked out of elevators and room. had to wait in line 30 minutes to get a key. hotel staff was rude and talked over me. light burned out in our bathroom and my wife couldn't do he make up for the night. hotel floor was so sticky. I will never again visit Manday Bay.
50,Staff was on point this visit. All very kind and accommodating. The property is beautiful. And the pool/beach is one of the best on the strip. Our suite was top notch and the view of the strip was insane especially at night! Very pleased with our visit and plan to return.
50,What a great time we had at Mandalay Bay.  The food and service at Strip Steak exceeded our expectations. Try the Dr. feel Good if you enjoy a good bourbon. Goes very well with the perfectly cooked steak.  The room was modern warm and very relaxing.  Lady Luck was waiting for us at the slot machines.  Thank you Mandalay Bay and staff.
30,Stayed from 09/08-09/14. Rented two cabanas on Friday and Saturday. The condition of the cabanas were clean but need definite updating. Not worth the price of admission. The sand had cigarettes bottle caps and other garbage in them and people were openly smoking marijuana. On top of the “resort fee” you have to pay to use the fitness center at 25 dollars a day. So I’m not sure what the resort fee actually covers.    There are other places on the strip to stay.
10,We came to Vegas to celebrate my husbands 40th bday. We had family and friends fly out for the occasion. On our second night an employee entered our vacant 2 bedroom suite without permission and stole all our cash ($3500). We spent the entire next day filing reports with security and the police department. Missed out on the entire day with our family and friends and received very little help and compassion from Mandalay Bay’s management team. We were told that the investigation would take 3-5 days and there was nothing more they can do for us. They offered a dinner voucher only after I asked what exactly do they expect us to do for the next 36 hrs without any cash. Even the officer that came to take our statement commented on how poorly the security and management were handling the entire situation. My husbands 40th birthday was completely ruined as well as our relatives and friends that left flew out and left their families kids and jobs to celebrate with us. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!
20,Checking in takes a while the resort fees are really expensive parking is also really expensive. I didn’t sleep all night because there was a couple arguing and a concert was also going on. And one of the waters fell over and they wanted to charge me $22 for it.
50,After a flight change we decided to stay at Mandalay Bay for the night and had a great Stay Well room. Wonderful service with reception staff and bagmen as well. We were able to have dinner at Citizens and see the Michael Jackson One show.
30,Pros  -Great Check-in/Check-out staff  -Clean and luxurious rooms  -Great wave pool and venue space    Cons  -Awful gym mostly cardio w/free weights  -Missing some things in rooms like towels  -Not too many food options on property
20,Was suppose to be met at curbside for Vip check in was not !! Waited over 45 minutes to speak with front desk. Waited over 3 and a half hours to get into my room. Bell desk couldn't locate my bags !! Cane back with someone else's bag . Take pool out of the equation and ARIA is much better. They charged my credit card for food my last day when I had over $200 in comps . That had to be used before checkout. So they billed my card $68 dollars. When you are the farthest from the main strip . Your service level should be top notch!! I will say Michael Jackson One is an incredible show. But you don't have to stay there to enjoy it
50,Outstanding and friendly staff. Staff made stay a delight. Would definitely visit Mandalay again. Rooms were wonderful and had fantastic view. Greatly location and tram to other hotels extremely helpful.
50,I was very impressed with this hotel. It was kept very clean and the staff were always helpful. Philip at the taxi stand went out of his way to assist myself and my companions. We were having trouble obtaining a handicapped taxi and he made many calls to different companies and contacts to help us with this. As we had to wait awhile for a handicap taxi he provided us with bottles of water while we waited. His service was outstanding! The food choices at the hotel were varied and excellent and the slots at the casino seemed to pay well. The beach area made you feel like you were in the Caribbean. I will definitely return to this hotel in the future.
50,Friendly staff  great restaurants  rooms are very clean. I recommend Mandalay Bay. Check in and out very easy on the app. No lines waiting to get up elevators like I experienced at another resort in Vedas!
40,The pool area is one of the best features this hotel has going for it and the really big spacious room we rented  guest service wasn't too bad compared to a few other places I've been there in Vegas but it was not the greatest either compared to the MGM Grand or New York New York
30,After staying at some nicer hotels (Encore Vdara etc) I've gotten used to certain room features such as electronically controlled blackout shades do not disturb button etc. The features at Mandalay Bay are solely lacking in that regard. One of the faucet handles in the bathroom wasn't working. I also regret taking the Front Desk's offer of a room facing the pool. I wasn't able to sleep due to the loud music blaring from below.
40,My overall stay was good. The hospitality at this hotel is great. The rooms were clean and the staff took care of any concerns we had. I stayed in one of the Stay Well rooms and it was great. The only complaint I have is when we first got to the hotel room there wasn’t a sign stating moving or looking at the snacks or looking at the drinks in the mini bar would automatically charge you. On our 3rd day a few staff members came in with stickers that stated that the mini bar and snack tray have sensors and would charge if picked up or touched. They had charged me for an $18 snack item I never even consumed I had accidentally knocked it over. Now that I know that I will be careful on my next stay. I would absolutely stay again. This hotel is really nice. They have really good restaurants and stores inside the hotel. I do wish they offered a separate mini fridge for free upon request for how much we pay for the room and resort fee but that’s ok. I know the place has to make money.
50,This was my first time staying at Mandalay Bay Very impressed how very clean the room was.They are not cheap with toiletries. Their member service was excellent and very professional. We will stay there again
30,We checked in at 9pm and there were no rooms like the one we had booked available so we got a room on the stay well floor. Which meant it was an assessable room nothing special but the room is on a higher floor making the view quite good and meaning we had less people using the elevators. The location means you have to be prepared to do a lot of walking. It's like the hotel knows they have people cornered so the prices for everything are so high. knowing that we couldn't use the fridge I'm glad I brought a cooler bag for ice (the machine on our floor was broken so we had to get a key for another floor) and we grabbed some beverages and snacks and kept them in there. I also picked up a mug and packed k-cups so I could have coffee in the room when I woke up.
50,Clean beautiful rooms lots of food options fun relaxing environment. Best pool. Friendly staff and I love the smell when you walk through the casino it always is so nice and clean there as well. Lots of great attractions to go explore as well.
20,The rooms were old and in much need of an update. The air conditioning was terrible. Limit set to “65” but the room was much warmer. Somplai Ed and they dropped it down to “60”. Still too warm in our room. Will not come here again.
20,After a 8 hour flight we checked in at 10 pm and our room was not available. We received a room upgrade and $100 voucher. After waiting 3 hours we were told there were no more rooms. At this point we knew something was going on. Guests were being transferred to other hotels due to flooding issues. At this point I’m pissed because they moved us to the cheap outdated and creepy Luxor hotel. To accommodate us they gave us another $100 voucher and supposedly credit us one day which I’m still waiting on. The move was a total inconvenience. We had to wait a hour get our luggage (2am) and drag them to the Luxor and wait in their line to check in again and then wake up at 11am and drag all our luggage back to Mandalay Bay. The voucher was a waste because we left with $110 still available. The front desk tell you lies just to make you hopeful. I just need to know how to get my 1 day credit since I paid through a 3rd party company.
30,"When we arrived the reservation that I had booked in my name somehow got changed to my dad's name (I used his rewards but put my name and phone number on the reservation the phone # was still the same) so they had to call my dad at 1:30am to confirm the reservation. Additionally they had no king rooms available even though we reserved our king room months ago and stuck us in a two queen bed room which they claimed was more expensive so technically we were getting an ""upgrade."" However we really wanted the King room we had booked and didn't care for the so-called ""upgrade."" Additionally walls were very thin so we could hear the room next door having a full on conversation. Morning of checkout room service tried to come into our room TWICE (once at 9am while we were still sleeping the second time I was showering) to clean even though our checkout was 11. They couldn't wait 2 hours to thoroughly clean the room while we were gone? Overall while we liked our room and the overall hotel was pretty nice and great food I don't know if we'd come back to an MGM property because of how poorly it was ran."
50,Spend the extra money for the Stay Well room it is worth it. Excellent staff super fun wave pool and lazy river. All staff were helpful and friendly. Location at end of the strip made travel much easier. My only complaint was the cigar (yuck) and cigarette smoke in the casino; we didn’t gamble but you have to walk through the casino to access the tram and parking garage. I’d love the hotel even more if they go smoke free!
50,Mandalay Bay is always my favorite from the site to the pool! Everyone is always helpful and awesome gambling is consistent and shopping is great as well. Food is never disappointing and just overall my favorite place to be!
40,Great place to have fun. The pool was awesome as well as the spa. Thank you Mandalay Bay for a great vacation and stay away from r om home. Eventhough a pipe busted and we were put in the Four Seasons.
40,My husband and I stayed for 2 nights at Mandalay Bay. We were assigned a room on the 16th floor with a view of the pool. Sounded special; however upon exiting the elevator we wondered what happened to the air conditioning. The intention of this stay was to experience the wonderful entertainment that Las Vegas provides. We selected Mandalay Bay as they presented images of lovely pools. We ventured over to the Luxor for the AGT show which was excellent. The next day we left for a Hoover Dam tour; that evening we enjoyed Cirque's Michael Jackson show at Mandalay - this is an epic presentation of extraordinary dance acting acrobatics and more. The hotels location satisfied our stay. The room was clean and comfortable although 65F did not feel cool enough. We did not complain as our stay was short.
30,The hallways to the room smelled of smoke/dampness. However the rest of the hotel was great! Room was clean and restaurants were awesome! Also there was plenty of room and the pool along with plenty of staff.
20,Need a deep cleaning in rooms and get rid of fee to park valet for guests. Might provide coffee in rooms instead of weight sensing items in room/fridge. Will not stay here again but the pool was very nice
20,Stole 1600 dollars from me for chairs and cabana that I canceled and was told I wouldn’t be charged. No one would help to fix this when I called and called. Waited on hold for ever and then they said I would have to be transferred and then they disconnected me
10,Had a half tank of gas stolen from my vehicle in valet. Was told by guest services that there was nothing that could be done.    Used the mobile check in and never received my electronic key. We still had to stand in line to receive a key causing us to miss a dinner reservation.
50,Mandalay Bay is perfect location views bars & restaurants and great prices. Especially if you come down to see the Las Vegas Raider’s. I can’t wait to get back to Las Vegas and stay at Mandalay Bay
20,Pick a different property. Staff cares very little about your stay. They treat you as an inconvenience. The pool is not worth it the restaurants are not great & the elevators are difficult. Trust me even if you are going to Allegiant pick a different property.
50,We stayed at Mandalay Bay on September 8-10th. Our primary reason for the trip was to attend a concert. The close proximity to the Stadium was thee reason for our choice. It was an excellent choice of venue. We will most definitely stay here again. Everything was perfect.
50,We enjoyed our stay at the Mandalay Bay. The House of Blues was one of our favorite places to eat and the entertainment was a plus. We saw the Michael Jackson One show which was awesome. We will definitely go back!
50,We love the Mandalay Bay! The pools the rooms the casino (smells so nice) the restaurants and the entire staff are incredible! We didn’t even leave the resort the entire stay…such an amazing trip. Go see Nick in the salon for the best hair experience. If you eat at Citizens ask for Gideon and Umi is a must if you enjoy sushi! Amazing and fresh!!! If you go to the pool ask for Jason or Geisel they are the best!
50,Mandalay Bay has been our go to for about 15 years!! Best pools best staff great eats and super clean! We know we are at Mandalay Bay by that amazing aroma you get when you walk in the doors. When we are at the Bay we feel at home see you again in November!!!
30,Older design poor service hard to get help room dirty. Elevators werent working properly the entire time. Restaurants were down one evening due to a pipe burst. I would never go back but it was fine to be there. The pool is nice its a family environment. The aquarium isn't included in the stay i thought it was based on what I read.
40,We spent the long weekend labor day in this hotel and it was a good stay for the whole family having comfortable bed accesible to strip and most of the area and the airport the only thing that bothered us was the hallway carpet stinks everytime we goes out it seems that there was something in the floor that they need to put like an exhaust fan to minimize the smell we stayed at the 23rd floor that time. But over all experience its a thumbs up.
40,Loved it here! Everyone was nice and extremely informative. My only problem was we were promised an early check in and had to wait four hours to be checked in. Also there was a time where we were threaten by someone off the street and it took some time before any help arrived. The room was cleaned very well and room service was lighting fast. I would definitely stay here again.
50,this was a casual trip to get out of town and visit friends. the hotel and staff are professional friendly and accommodating. my room was comfortable and spacious. the pool area is great to cool off or sit back and relax.
30,AC in room was in sufficient. Room was uncomfortably hot. Talked to staff and they notified somebody would check it out. Wasn’t fixed. Asked to be changed rooms to which they responded no because they were at capacity. Couldn’t use sheets during stay because we were sweating in our own room. The rest of the property and staff was nice and friendly
30,We are locals who came for our 10 year anniversary. Check in was good and our first night was good. First morning had the water issue and the fire. Communication about what was going on was terrible. Security was less than helpful. Not knowing the extent of the issue I walked up 18 flights of stairs to get to my wife. From then on it was a circus trying to use the elevators because half of them were shut down for maintenance or not working. Water pressure in the shower was intermittent. Very hard to get the right temperature and when I did the pressure would drop come back drop again and continue until I got out. The toilet room smelled like urine and cigarette smoke.
10,I have been coming here 1-2 times per year for the last 15 years. I have always loved the family friendly pool. The last few years the hotel has begun to show its age. I have seen minor issues remain neglected and unrepaired. In 2021 when I went I wasn’t happy with the condition of my room. I came again this year and once I got to my room I saw issues and regretted booking there again. I had two rooms and both had the following issue: showers not clean dirt on walls door repaired with masking tape hair dryer not working sewage smell sewage backing up in tub shower not draining windows filthy magnifying mirror in bathroom not working sleeper sofa mattress old dirty and disfigured. It takes hours to get a rollaway bed extra towels etc. after checkin if you’re lucky enough to get them to answer the phone.    On the second day I heard a woman in a room next to mine on the 30th floor yelling about sewage and water back up in her room that she had called about but no one came to fix. My room with sewage back up was on the 28th floor so I knew it was obviously a big plumbing issue.    Later that night a hot water pipe burst and part of the 30th floor flooded. We could not get to our room for some time. Security told us we could not take photos - which we did anyway because we had a right to document our damages. Both rooms were without water for hours and we could not take showers after having been out in the heat all day. Toilets couldn’t flush. Staff was unapologetic and said if we wanted to wash our hands we could walk to the Delano. I saw on Facebook and in reviews here that many people have had issues with not having water here going back months so it seems the plumbing issues have been ongoing.    After my floor flooded we asked for a new room and we’re given a smaller room than what we had paid for. The manager did not want to comp our room despite it being less than what we were being charged for the fact that all our belongings were wet the fact that we had no water etc. I had to argue and yell to get some compensation. When we would call guest services no one would answer. We had to go all the way to the lobby to ask questions about the water get updates or request towels and extra pillows.    The rooms aren’t cheap here and I don’t know how long they can maintain a client base with the condition of their hotel. I would not stay here again even if it was free.
10,No A/C no running water for 18+ hours our room temperature was over 85 all night and couldn’t even flush the toilet. Management promised us a new upgraded room before 8am the next day and we received a call from Russia 10 hours after the promised time giving us ten minutes to report to the front desk for our new room. No refund was issued and we found a much nicer resort to spend our holiday weekend. Children were injured from fiberglass in the pools and rather than calling on qualified medical personnel the management was using tape and tweezers on crying children!!!!! I have received better accommodations and customer service from motel 6 than this resort.
40,Room was nice and clean.Band at bar was excellent and Michael Jackson One show was excellent! Restaurants were really good and service was great! The pools were nice too! Overall it was a very nice trip!
10,Our stay was very bad. No water 2 days. Flood in the next hallway making everything humid. No ice. Paid extra for VIP package and got a ride to and from the airport and 1 complimentary beverage per day. Not worth $125 per day. Housekeeping couldn't even change the towels and sheets when that was all we asked for. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
20,The room was dirty. We asked a few times to have it cleaned. Finally on the 2nd day they cleaned it. Also had to wait for an hour in front desk line to clear up the parking charge and two $50 dinning credits that were supposed to be issued to me for booking.
50,Hotel is awesome but far away from the opposite side of the strip. Took forever to get to places. The pool was amazing the drinks were amazing the food was amazing but the water situation sucked. It took us forever to get warm water as well as a flushable toilet.
50,This is our go to place in Las Vegas and has been since it opened in March of 1999. We have never been disappointed and we’re in Vegas 3-4 times a year. The rooms are clean and well appointed and there is never a long wait for the elevators. The sports book is roomy with food and drink right there. The spa is excellent and very clean and the pool is out of this world. Try t…you’ll like it.
50,The property is great the staff are friendly and professional. The suite I had was extremely nice and well updated. My only issue is with MLIFE rewards. The changes they made effective 1-1-22 are terrible for the player. They significantly increased the amount of play it takes to earn tier points and MLIFE dollars. It truly makes me rethink my relationship with MGM properties and want to explore other reward programs. With that said the Mandalay Bay property is extremely nice. It’s on the very southern end of the strip so only a few other properties are within reasonable walking distance.
40,1st night well he got in at 4a.m and we left at 9a.m we cam back our room was not serviced so I called they sent us someone to clean they did not leave enough towels no toilet paper 2nd night our room was not cleaned so I called early they said they would get it done came back to my room around 3pm and it was not done yet frustrating no clean glasses no wash cloth and our floor ice machine was broken so we had to call for 2 buckets of ice there limit they only brought 1 so I had to call again we have stayed before but never had this experience
40,Some people dont like that this property is at the far south end of the strip. We did not find that to be a problem. we did not have a car but with the tram and monorail system we were able to get to all the places we wanted to go to. Yes you walk a lot but with all the good food you eat that is not a bad thing. They take very good care of the property and it is very clean.
50,Our kids enjoyed the Mandalay Bay beach wave pool and lazy river. We were able to get conjoining rooms. Both sides had two queen beds. The rooms are super big. We had more than enough space for everyone in our party and being able to go back and forth through the rooms were a plus.
50,What a great place. The casino floor doesn't stink of angry people and smoke (like most places) and it isn't overrun. I've never gotten a bad meal there. The rooms are nice sized. It's at the end of the strip so getting around is a bit harder than at other casinos but you can walk to luxor New York New York and that castle one very easily and the monorail station is air conditioned. The wave pool is the best way to start your day the lazy river is a hoot and you don't have to buy an inner tube just get in and be swept around.
20,I felt like I was taxed and fee to death. Room AC not that good and sweated all night. Food over priced and medoicre. If you are a high roller enjoy your stay here but other wise look elsewhere. Next time I may stay off strip and be with the average guys.
40,Libertine Social and Cotizens just exceptional service from entering the door. The lazy pool beach and wave pool was outstanding. kudos!! The room can use a little tlc shower head malfunctions. Was offered a credit on behalf of priority services.
30,This specifically references the water pipe bursting the early morning of Friday 02-SEP-2022 (approximately 4:30 AM according to the management that I spoke to on one of the service elevators).  I left my room at approximately 6:30 AM to go down and get my morning coffee. When I reached the elevators on my floor none of the elevators were running and I ended up using the stairs to go down where I exited the building close to the pool area. I re-entered Mandalay Bay at the pool level where employees were cleaning/mopping water that had run onto the floor from the pipe breakage without much of an explanation as to what was going on. I then went up to the lobby level where I was re-directed outside the building and informed that the only way to get back up to my room was via the service elevators that the employees use on the lobby level. When I went back to my room in one of these very crowded service elevators (due to no guests being able to use the guest elevators) I turned on the TV to see if any of the channels had information about what was going on or when we would be able to use the guest elevators again with no information provided. Additionally there were no messages regarding what was going on via text message or any other means that the hotel might have of letting the guests know what was going on regarding the maintenance issue (with the pipe bursting). Later in the morning my son and I went down to get breakfast for the family and there was finally a hotel employee in the hall to re-direct us to the service elevators (he was not there at 6:30 AM). When coming back up the service elevator the second time I spoke with someone who identified himself as the Vice President of security with Mandalay Bay who told us about the pipe bursting at 4:30 AM and that during the clean-up of the water leak a van had caught on fire (and he showed those of us on the elevator cell phone photos of the van on fire); this then explained why all the smoke was present outside and why they had the doors open to the outside to ventilate or try and remove the smoke that was in the lobby area. Later after breakfast our family was going to try and go to the pool but since the guest elevators were still not working we took the stairs again to get down to the pool (since the building exit from our wing was by the pool area anyway). Later when the guest elevators started working again the access to the service elevators was discontinued which made getting up or down very difficult due to the serious congestion of guests needing to get up or down and with all the guest elevators being full and no one making room it would sometimes take 30 minutes or more to get an elevator. We ended up having to get on an elevator going up (we were staying on the 3rd floor) to get down to the casino/lobby level because no one going down had enough room to let us on the elevator.  I understand that a pipe bursting in the middle of the night is a situation that the staff of Mandalay Bay had no control over. However I do wish that we would have been alerted about the issue (while still in our room via text message or over the TV) than eventually finding out about it via an employee on one of the service elevators. Also the messaging about how to get out of the hotel/room and around the property could have been much better handled.
30,I used to stay here about 15 years ago in it's heyday. It's still a very nice hotel but is showing its age a bit. It could just use a little refresh. The check in took forever and then when we got to the desk they said that they didn't have any king rooms left. At 3:30 (after 3pm check in time) they still did not and gave me a story about how check in is actually 3 to 6pm. Very convenient for them. They offered me a room with two queens to get settled. They didn't offer but I asked for dining credit so they gave me $75 and we agreed to the room downgrade. They have the annoying weighted refrigerator if you touch anything. One of the main draws here are the huge pools. We didn't get to use them as we had other plans. Also the Michael Jackson Cirque show is here.
50,Very nice cozy rooms beds were very comfy and the pool was fantastic we even found some shaded chairs by the lazy river. Drinks out there were very expensive though. So make a point of bringing out ice water in a yeti or Stanley container.
30,Love the property and the pool. Checking in was better than the last time. Don't expect help something goes wrong. Concierge is kind of rude. The real MVP's are at the pool area. Manny works hard to help situate us. America and the other reception staff were nice and had consideration
50,Was a bit nervous after reading recent reviews our stay was perfect! From the second we checked in until we left frequent quality customer service well maintained room great pool areas ready to return!
20,Loved the atmosphere of the hotel. My only gripe was the hidden resort fees that were charged from the 300 deposit which was required at check in. I wasn’t even aware of the 300 deposit. What if I came all the way from Virginia without enough money on a card.
50,We really enjoyed the lazy river and the wave pool. My family also enjoyed the service. There was a great selection of places to eat. Easy access to other casinos using the tram. Really impressed with our stay and I highly recommend it.
50,Beautiful Hotel . Mandalay has the best pools on the strip. They’re wave pool is awesome. Everything about this hotel is excellent. Extremely clean. Friendly staff. The tram station is the best  no need to walk to Luxor or Excalibur.
10,Our hotel room had no running water sinks didn't work no showers toilets didn't flush for 2 of the 3 days of our stay. One of the days we had water pouring through our ceiling and flooding our bathroom. Elevator was not working for one of the days and we felt trapped on the 29th floor again with no water! Poorly maintained hotel - do not stay here!
40,Aside from giving us the wrong room # at first with checking in and issues with their elevators working properly (they were doing maintenance).. most everything else was wonderful! View from the room cleanliness housekeeping staff was great! Had to Uber to the strip but we knew the location was far on one end. Got an online room discount by almost $300 for booking directly through Mandalay's site and signing with MGM rewards. Thank you Mandalay for making our girls trip memorable! Till next time Vegas!!
10,stayed from sept 1st to the 4th. After we check in we were told that there was going to be an interruption with the water service. from 1 am to 6am. Tried to ise the restroom at 9am and there was no water. The issue continued thru the weekend with interminent water availability. I think we would've been better off at a 1-star motel.
40,Fantastic pool and space to gather and reconnect with friends and family. Service at the pool was attentive. Having to pay for shade and the expense of things in the pool area were disappointing but we had a great time. Attitude is everyting!
40,Guest services used to be excellent but this trip is not a good trip..the front desk is not what it used to be…needs a charging station for electric car vehicle without using the valet…meaning charging station….cars park and not being charged should  Be move away or towed away..
50,The property was beautiful and conveniently located. There were several really good restaurants on site. We saw the Michael Jackson ONE Cirque Du Soleil show and it was outstanding! The staff was also great
30,Ice maker on our floor was out of order the entire stay. Additionally a water leak forced us out of our rooms at 1:00 AM the last night of our stay and the hotel didn't have any others for us to move to. We ended up having to drive home at 2:00 in the morning last minute without getting a full night sleep.    The hotel is nice but it's aging and I don't think it's worth the price they're asking compared to some of the newer ones on the strip.
40,My room was spacious. Comfy bed. There was a little dust on the toilet. Room seemed clean otherwise. I had a great view of the swimming area. My room faced the airport. I could hear the planes but it didn't bother me too much. If you are sensitive to noise ask for a room that doesn't face the airport. Finally review your account before checking out. They charged me $30 for valet parking but I didn't have a car the entire trip! I only used the shuttles and Uber to get around. Luckily I caught it and called the front desk. They fixed the mistake immediately.
40,We had a wonderful time enjoyed ourselves the casino is a little small good food selections would definitely stay again only wish would be fir a small refrigerator in the room overall was a good experience
50,Staff was awesome facility clean so much to see and do. We ate at Seabreeze for breakfast and wolfgang puck for dinner. Both great. Splurge a little get the cabana. We had full fridge of drinks rafts couches table and chairs. Wait staff on your beck and call.
50,Defenetely I will be back great hotel casino pool restaurants and ambient.  Employees are so helpful and always there and alway nice . I will come back to this resort and casino and the restaurants are always top class
50,Very nice rooms great amenities wonderful pools something for everyone restaurants casino is very fun close to many other attractions. Moorea is a great adult option pool that we love. Starbucks is right downstairs. Very kid friendly hotel and even dogs!
20,The hotel caught on fire the first day of our trip then the water was turned off twice sprinkler system flooded our floor and the casino I was double charged and over charge at the front desk and the bay beach. I prepaid $6000 for my stay and got charge an additional $4500    Never staying here again.
10,Poor service. Poor rooms. Moldy showers and the air didn’t get below 72! They also wanted us to sleep in queen beds bc the room we booked for our anniversary wasn’t available. They offered an upgrade then said oops jk you have to pay for that. It was overall such a disappointment. Will NOT be staying here again
50,Mandalay Bay really has it all. Gteat variety and quantity of table games and slots. Restaurants are amazing the pool (of course) and always friendly staff. Clean secure and a great reason to go to Vegas.
40,Loved the room but resented having to at $12 for plastic coffee. Do not touch anything unless you are willing to pay for it. They also will charge $50 if you store anything in their refrigerators. Check in process was smooth and stay was enjoyable.
40,Stayed here with my wife for 4 nights while on vacation.  Main reason for choosing this property was the pool area and restaurants.  Overall we had a great stay. Checked in online as soon as we landed and had our digital key by 1:30 which was awesome. Appeared physical check in was very busy every time we were down in the lobby.  Room was large bed was comfortable. Décor was a little dated I would say but overall no issues at all. Bathroom had nice tub and separate shower. Not a grat view (roof top) but not a big deal. Only real issue was some very loud neighbors which caused us to be up most of the first night. When we went past the next morning the maids were cleaning the room and it appeared by the smell there had been a big party in it.  Elevators were hit and miss. Digital keys didn't always work which caused some issues. I recommend getting a physical key once you are checked in which eliminated this problem.  Pool area was large with wave pool lazy river and 2 large pools. Sand was burning hot so we mainly stayed by the pools. Really nice area though spent a lot of time down there and loved it. We brought our own floaties but didn't use them much. Nice for the lazy river though.  Location isn't ideal if you are wanting to walk the strip. The tram's that are available cut down on some of the distance. Mcdonalds and liquor store across the street which was handy.  Staff was friendly cleaning staff came daily and did a great job. Casino was large and didn't get too busy it seemed. Nice dining options there as well as a neat shopping mall type area.  Overall a very good stay. Other than location and one night of noise there wasn't much I would change.  Tips:  Bring your own cooler if you can nice to have a spot to put beer  Use check in/check out online. Avoid the lineups.
30,Okay for the price you are paying bed was very comfortable though. That was the one of the reason I gave it a 3 star. You have to be a high roller to get better treatment. Our room wasn’t ready when got there and we checked in later that night 9 pm. Way after the check in time.
50,My first time ever staying there and it was awesome! Great friendly helpful stafff. Room is amazing the cafe we went to ( Sea breeze) offers a lot of choices at an affordable price. Overall I recommend this hotel/casino to stay and play
30,For an older property Mandalay Bay is nice. It's just a bunch of little things that bug me. The pool offers NO SHADE anywhere unless you buy a reserved lounge chair. Daily resort fee but the wifi didn't work in half the places most of the time. No free parking but their parking structures are a hangout for people smoking stuff with no security in sight. Coffee in the room is for an extra charge (even Motel 6 has free coffee in the room). I will say the rooms are damn near soundproof which is nice.
20,The only gym for guests is at Spa for $25+/day fee and closes at 5 or 6pm. There is a cardio center with some below average cardio equipment and a rack of incomplete/missing weights and one incline bench and one fixed decline bench. It blew my mind that a property like this and MGM owned resort would not have at least a decent basic gym included for its guests.
10,We have previously stayed at Mandalay and have had good experiences. This stay however was frustrating. To start our room’s AC was broken and the room was 80 degrees. When we went to take a shower the hot water was not working. Additionally the toilet wouldn’t flush. We called guest services but were dismissed with a “we put you on the list and can’t tell you when it will be resolved.” It was never resolved. Insult to injury when we checked out they charged us 50 dollars for opening the mini fridge mind you we did not consume any products. It seems the management has made poor decisions and it reflects on the experience of the hotel.
20,Choose this hotel based on reviews that it is family friendly and while the pool may be fun for kids the rest of the hotel is not great. Poor dining options poor service and overall underwhelming. Would not stay again.
30,Mándalay Bay is a great resort. The pools are awesome and the staff working the pools are friendly and incredible. The extra fees are a bit too much and surprising sometimes. From taxes to resort fees to parking fees. Ugh!!
50,Enjoyed our quick getaway to Las Vegas over Labor Day weekend. After a late check in due to flight delays it was wonderful to climb in to a comfortable bed for some Zzz’s. Staff from front desk bell hop housekeeping restaurants and shops were all friendly and helpful. Would love to come back soon!
30,The room I stayed in was in need of updated decor. The shower was moldy on the floor and the walls. The bathroom had hair on the floor and the towels were worn. I have stayed at the Wynn & the Bellagio and was not expecting that level. I was surprised my room in the Mandalay Bay was such a large step down. Perhaps I was in an old wing/floor.
10,Horrible stay & service 1st the water won't work we comeback its to a flooded rm we had to wait for another rm with the option of stay in flooded rm or go 2 the new rm with dirty b/r no help moving too
10,Paid for early check in and had to wait really long for a room because the attendant accidentally assigned us to a room with late check out. I had to go back and wait in line again a while after just yo fix the problem and only got a sorry. Attendants also messed up the parking activation for our keys. Our $50 food credit that we paid for wasn’t applied. Also our room was dirty and smelled. All that we got from the staff multiple times was I’m sorry without any attempt to make things right.
10,We had water interruption issues daily elevator outages couldn’t find housekeeper to get fresh towels. My first MGM experience wasn’t super great for the price. The front desk was kind but overall - I would not stay here again.
40,Great property and we were very happy with the room and variety of restaurants but could not believe we were told we’d have to pay a cover charge to use one of the hotel’s pools even though we had asked in advance and been told there was no charge for hotel guests. Also music was blaring at night & our windows were shaking - on the 17th floor. Elevator key card system was a pain to use & sensors didn’t work half the time. Citizen’s restaurant was great & lots of great dining options. Foundation Room lounge was outdated & not a good crowd. Steaks & food at Foundation Room was tasteless overpriced and disappointing. Otherwise a decent property and very affordable rooms.
50,I had a great time during my trip. Mandalay Bay is in a good enough location that I was able to get to everything I needed fairly quickly and easily. Some of the elevators had issues so some of our wait times to get back to our room were high but it was not unbearable. Our key cards also stopped working frequently which was frustrating but…not too bad. Each time we went to the desk our issues were handled promptly.
10,Pros (based on the wkend I had)    Sea breeze Cafe - I believe the waitress’s name was Shannon and another lady who stopped by both were so sweet and nice. The food was good too.    Casino - won some money. That’s always a plus.    Now onto the hotel/room experience…    Arrived Thurs night a little after 12 we were told that the water on floors 17 and up would be turned off from 1am-6am.    When the water finally came on there was no hot water. We had to take cold showers.    The AC on the 29th floor wasn’t working properly. We called someone about it the next day he came by at the time we were getting ready to go out and said that he most likely wouldn’t be back. We just assumed he had a list of other rooms to go too.    There was a car on fire outside the hotel.    The elevator lobby flooded. My friend was stuck downstairs for 3hrs. She eventually had to put plastic bags over her shoes.    The day before we left we came back to our room and the entire ceiling was leaking. I guess 2hrs prior to that a pipe bursted on the 30th floor. Damage to our property as well as there’s. We never used the tub but tub was filled with water. The counters and floors were wet. I had a big puddle in my suitcase. Ruined some shoes.    The AC completely stopped working. Wouldn’t even come on.    The toilet didn’t flush. And when we tried to turn the water on it sounded like it was trying it’s best to come out.    Only 1 of the keycards worked. The mobile one on my phone worked on the door but not the elevator.    When we went down to tell them about the ceiling there was a long line of people complaining about the AC. It was 110+ degrees outside. We needed AC.    When they finally accommodated us the gave us a single bed room. When it was a total of 4 of us. I slept in the chair the last night.
20,Mandalay Bay used to be the gold standard for quality and service. As newer casinos have emerged over the year and have become more competitive in attracting customers through friendly service cleanliness and member's reward comps Mandalay have stalled. They seem to be stuck in their old ways and no longer display the high end qualities of today's higher gold standard. However their pricing throughout the casino from pool rentals hotel rooms and food would try to persuade you otherwise.
10,Water turned off from midnight to noon sound bar woke us up every hour from 2am-8am room didn’t cool properly keys stopped working every day no one seemed to care got a 75 credit on a 6k bill. Basically a 1% discount marker dept/casino cage act like you bug them
50,Great pool area for families! They have a wave pool lazy river lagoon for small toddlers and attentive staff. Great restaurants! We ate at the pool and the platters are the way to go. Lot of food and better deal/pricing. Strip Steak was amazing! The staff was helpful & courteous throughout the hotel. The tram takes you from Mandalay Bay to the Luxor & Excalibur for free!
20,2 out of 3 days of our stay the water was shut off and one day when the water came back we still didn't have hot water. Cold showers are okay if that's what you're looking for but I wasn't. We had a purchase bottles of water to brush our teeth and wash our faces. At no point did anyone contact us to apologize and offer a discount or a new room so we just had to go without.
10,Hot water line broke causing cascading water to pour into our room. They placed Us in another room but that room didn't have running water either. No sink water no toilet water no bath water no shower water
10,Key doors didn't work only 1 did bed and restroom had black hairs so not cleaned properly. Door had to get kicked open everytime we entered and called 4 times to get room temperature to cold and always promised to send tech out we never got cold air and was stuffy we decided to leave early today since it was a sauna in the room. We spent extra time out of the room for that reason.
20,Too many problems here. Not a luxury hotel at all. Too far from the happening areas of the strip. Had to take a taxi back and forth. Plumbing issues while here. Entire water pipe burst on the first floor. Complete mess. Restaurants and clubs close early and not the time advertised. Nothing opens early enough.
10,We booked a Junior Suite. Room carpet was dirty dated and gross. Furniture was worn and damaged. AC was broken at 110 degrees outside. Water went out 2X bc of a burst pipe which I understand is beyond their control but they could have made some concessions No help from staff on that or fixing the AC. My advice if you’re looking for clean and nice property pass on this one. Just didn’t seem like there was a lot of staff and at times it felt unsafe.
50,We loved our stay at Mandalay Bay. All the staff we encountered was so friendly and personable. Our room was great and the bed was so comfortable! The property has a lot of offer and we will definitely stay here again!
50,We came to Las Vegas to relax and getaway from home. The hotel was nice and the experience was enjoyable. We will come back again when we get the opportunity to return. We enjoy coming during the summer so we can go to the pools and the music is great.
30,Flooded floors elevators were down no water for a day and half. When asked for accommodations of this issue they offered $150 in food credit. What a joke. They advertise “kids property “ and have no kids food. I’ll never stay there again.
10,Our stay was so TERRIBLE we checked out a day early. After paying for a upgraded room we found out later that evening the guest who were there decided not to check out. We then received a standard room that reeked of smoke just to get another room with No working air conditioning flooding warning alarm going off told the problem had been fixed just to have no running water to shower wash your hands or flush the toilet. After repeatedly calling to the front desk. We Used a bottle of water from the mini bar to flush the toilet and had a room charge of $10 for it (which was later removed when I complained at the desk). It was a DISASTROUS stay! I don’t plan to ever return and I’ll definitely share this Horrible experience with everyone I know and then some. It was Absolutely Terrible!!
30,The room was excellent and very clean. The Valet and Bell Desk were very helpful and attentive. However there were multiple hot water shortages throughout our stay. We were here for a wedding and it was very inconvenient to not be able to take a shower at certain times. And it was extremely difficult to talk to anyone at the front desk about this issue. However the restaurants and bars were awesome very good food and drinks. Jeff at Libertine Social was one of the best bartenders/servers I’ve ever had.
10,Mandalay bay had no running water on Friday and on Saturday night our room was flooded. I do not recommend this hotel. No one let us know that our floor was flooded so all my clothes and shoes were ruined.
50,Mobile check in is amazing. Room was ready before I even got on the Bell Trans Shuttle at 9 a.m.! Even got the room I wanted. QueenHigh floor pool view non connecting(they are quieter) Yes it's a walk but well worth it. Room was clean bed so comfy and pillows like a cloud! Wave Pool not crowded during the week. Big CISCO Convention but really only noticed once at elevators one evening. Best and only place I stay!
40,Very nice amenities for family and very clean hotel. Staff very helpful from front desk to cleaners. Casino floor area always clean and did not seem to see any security issues. Great place for families pool area was wonderful for the kids and being close to luxor and excalibur was excellent.
50,They upgraded our room because we got in so early. They made sure we had everything we needed. The employees were nice and very helpful. The casino has great food and the best air conditioner ever. We will only stay at Mandalay Bar while in Vegas and so should you.
50,Our suite had the picture perfect panaramic view just as it is advertised. The room was clean and modern. The staff was pleasant and welcoming. The M Life program has the greatest perks! Our casino host is the best! Thank you Scott!
50,the pools and sunbed facilities were unreal! the pool is what made the visit so special and we were constantly down there 24/7. However we recommend saving sunbeds early for the shade unless you are willing to pay for a cabana but be prepared they can rack up to a £1000 a day!    however couldn't fault the room cleaners! constant room cleans and shampoo/conditioner and the little extras were so helpful since the drunken mess we made was unbelievable and for 3 of us in the room little bottles of shampoos ect needed renewing frequently.    shops food courts and fancy restaurants littered the hotel therefore there was enough for everyone!    highly recommend this hotel!
20,We recently took a trip to Las Vegas to enjoy the weekend with family. While we enjoyed the wonderful mattresses inside the room that was the extent of the enjoyment. Everyone gambling lost all of their money not even hitting minor wins to allow continued play. The food is ridiculously overpriced and the staff were far and in between when help was needed at a machine fault. All in all it was not as enjoyable of an experience as we had thought it would be.
20,No water way longer than expected. No direction from hotel on where to shower in the morning.Couldn't even flush toilet. There was over 10 min wait to contact front desk. Bottle water was supposed to be free but we were charged. We had to wait extra 20 mins to get the price adjusted at check out. The beds are too soft.
30,Hotel is nice and clean. Staff are friendly. However There was an issue one morning and we had no running water for a few hours. There was no real solution just was told by the front desk we could walk over to the Delano and use their facilities if we needed to. We waited because we were told that the water should be restored by 10am but it was closer to 1130-12pm.
10,This hotel provides a room - and that’s basically it. You pay for parking. You pay for “Resort Fees” which add nothing. You have to BUY a raft for the lazy river (not even an option to rent). And best of all had no running water on one day of the stay - hotel didn’t try to make it up to us in any way. Stay at Venetian or Wynn or ANYwhere outside the MGM Resort family
30,Toilet was not cleaned properly. No face towel and floor mat provided one day and no hand towel another day. Items left in the closet from the previous guest. Location wise it is convenient if you are attending a conference at the convention center but it is the furthest from the strip.
10,My wife and i love Mandalay Bay Mirage however this last stay was the worst experience we've ever had. They were working on a neighboring room so we heard hammering and other loid noises. Water was shutdown and took longer than promised. Elevators didnt work. Just awful
30,Everything has not been updated probably since was built. If you like old dated overpriced hotels this is a must visit. The Rivea restaurant on the Delano 64th floor has a great view of the vegas strip but food was average
50,The pool area is by far the best in Vegas! The cleanliness and friendliness of the staff is also top notch. I have stayed at this property 10 or 11 times throughout the years and it never fails to disappoint.
50,Everything that you need is right here at the hotel. From the pools pool bars restaurants shopping and even the Michael Jackson ONE Cirque Du Soleil show. The staff was very nice and the rooms were super clean. I will definitely be back.
30,Room did not have mini fridge for guest to use it was a wet bar stocked with their stuff. You couldn't use it no microwave and AC sucked set it to 66 and didn't get cool enough to sleep well.    Staff was friendly and check in was easy
40,Check-in was fast and efficient with both face to face and digital options the bell staff was polite and organized all the staff that I encountered at the Mandalay Bay were excellent seemingly well trained and professional yet polite and very helpful.
10,I checkout my bill before I checkout no charges were present. Hours later I was sent a bill for $64. I didn't eat or drink anything that was provided in the room but now that I am home I have no way to prove that. I am surprised such a large hotel would resort to scamming guests. Will never return to the Mandalay Bay.
10,Hour and half to check-in dirty sheets and bath tub in hotel room no ice in machines on floor all week outrageously expensive $28 for a bottle of water $110.00 for room service for one person restaurant reservations were not made for us after hotel services confirmed they were bouncer at Foundation room restaurant was super rude and belittling the Casino pays nothing. Lost $1500.00 at Mandalay Bay and won at every other Casino! Do not stay here stay anywhere else!
30,This is a good hotel. Although staffing issues and the hotel's age is starting to show. The few staff that they have are very nice/friendly. It was almost impossible to get a drink in the casino. One evening we waited well over an hour before we finally found someone/were asked.  What they've done to the Mlife Program is sad. Closing of the Mlife desks says it all.
20,Worst experience we had in Vegas at Mandalay Bay. had to swith rooms 3 times on our first day in Vegas. 1st room - air conditioning was not working 2nd room sheets were dirty and smelly 3rd room - poop stains on toilet seat and bath tub dirty. we spoke with the manager on duty and he told us that they had given us a $100 dollar food credit and if we did not like it that we could leave. First of all I have MS (multiple sclerosis) so moving 3 times was very difficult. When we returned to our DIRTY room I had a nervous breakdown and could not stop crying. Mandalay Bay you have got to have better training for your managers!!!
20,Mandalay seems like an excellent place to stay. The restaurants are great and the pool is the best. However my stay was disappointing. Key card didn't work upon arrival which kept us stuck in the elevator going up to everyone else's floor before we could get back to the lobby to get a replacement keyand was met with a slightly sarcastic employee with no personality at the VIP desk. Our hallway always smelled of pot and housekeeping left white garbage bags of whatever they cleaned out of rooms for several hours. We even had to move one ourselves once when the cart was also blocking our way. We called twice to get the toilet fixed and once for the stopped up shower drain.
40,Great beds very comfortable good parking and easy to park great pools and fun stuff to do  lots of good food choices . Fun activities close to raiders stadium. Lots of restrooms good views of Vegas.
50,Best time I ever had . From my bed being cozey . The different types of bars . The staff is very helpful and friendly . The price for everything is decent. The air is very clean despite all the smoking that goes on .
30,Do not get a lower level room unless you want to deal with toilet bubbling and sink bubbling from people flushing I’m not sure if it was just our room  But it also had a septic like odor to it when it would bubble not ideal
40,Las Vegas hotel that is styled differently from some of the other mega hotels and provides a unique atmosphere that is refreshing compared to others huge properties. Same big variety of food and service offerings without the typical vegas casino styling.
30,I have been staying at this property for years we even stayed during COVID. This last experience in Aug was just so/so. They replaced all but one of their roulette tables with video versions the A/C in the room didn't work well and on top of resort fees they are now charging $18 for parking. We also had a less than ideal visit at the spa and it seems like the whole vibe of the hotel isn't as nice and pleasant as it used to be. We are probably going to find a new property to stay at next time we go to Vegas.
40,Hotel amenities were good. Easy access to casino from parking lot. Like the pool. Overall had a good experience. Restaurants were not open late and a Friday night. Atmosphere was good. The casino was not crowded like most hotels.
50,Really enjoyed our stay. Will definitely stay again! Weekday travel was great for quiet time by the pool ! Service was fine room spacious and very clean. Comfortable beds. Didn’t smell of smoke! Easy checkin via app and no keys to bother with was a plus!
40,The layout of the room was nice and I loved the bathroom. I felt spoiled with all of its amenities. I relaxed and gave myself a mini spa day in the room instead of joining my family at the pool. I will gladly return to Mandalay Bay in the future. I like the proximity to the airport Luxor and Excalibur. I had the best Mexican food I’ve ever had in the Mandalay Bay shops.
20,My family and I have been staying at the Mandalay Bay for 20 years and the care of the hotel has severely declined. The hotels fails to make minor repairs to the items in the room for instance the closet doors will not stay closed. Cleaning staff
30,Just okay not great but not terrible large casino lots to see but nothing real special little out dated and comps free play lacking but host staff are attentive Katherine is great if you have a chance she will treat you well
50,My Family and I had another wonderful vacation. we spent our days in the pool and and went to dinner in the evening and almost never left the property. our room were clean and he'd great views. can't wait to go back.
50,Excellent room with beautiful floor to ceiling panoramic view with one bedroom one big bathroom with Jacuzzi tub marble decoration and one dining room with huge table and one family room TV so altogether three TV in this penthouse it’s worth every penny. Limo pick up from the airport.
20,Blood stain on the bedsheets. The guy delivered my room service was disappointed with $20 tip on $160 dinner that he brought us and didn’t even say thanks. I’ve got a handicap room which the shower was awful.
50,Great rooms best pools in Vegas right next to the stadium and so many restaurants to choose from! Haven't stayed at this location in years but it still looks brand new. Definitely join the players club!
10,I booked a king suite and when checking in I was told they had no king rooms available and gave us a queen room. Then when my husband talked to them they suddenly found a king room. The key cards didn’t work for the elevator and I had to go back to the front desk multiple times after spending over 30 minutes trying to get to our room on 6 different elevators. The bath tub was filled with black hair.
10,The Wi-Fi was so spotty that it was unusable and they don’t let you use the fridge in your room. Seriously. They charged me $74 not for taking anything from the mini fridge but instead using it to chill my drinks. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to my enemies. It’s 2022 and I felt like I was back in the dark ages.
30,Every customer is a chance to have them spread a good word about the hotel. That chance is missed when there’s no effort to provide conversation on joining hotel programs no maps etc Need more conversations.
50,We stayed at the Mandalay Bay to do a live Fantasy football draft. It was a lot of fun and they helped us set up a Hold’em tournament to decide our draft order and did our draft pool side at a cabana.
20,I was there with a group of 5 people. 2 in my group had to move rooms because of bed bugs and the other one had someone's clothing he found between the headboard and mattress. He also had to fill out a police report for money stolen out of his room. Total we had about 11 rooms with our extended group. Next time we will stay at another hotel. We passed this on to the organizers of the convention also. My room was ok but my experience is based on the response of the resort when bed bugs were reported.
30,Very good options for restaurants and lounges not as great as you think for the pool area. Very overpriced lack of provided umbrellas to shade from the sun in 110° weather and you have to purchase your own tubes for the lazy river at $30 apiece. The lazy river is also on the smaller side.
50,Their bathroom was very good with bars and shower seat for those  that have to sit while showering in addition to bars in the separate tub. Every place was handicap accessible and easy to get in. I wasn't restricted in anyway. I used an electric scooter and could go anywhere.
20,When the Mandalay Bay was new and shiny it was the place to stay. For context I grew up in Vegas and watched it get built and saw it in its glory. Since 2013 I have been staying here when major events like Black Hat occur and also for fun (because...loyalty). This last trip however may have changed my mind. Problem 1: Locating the self-parking lot when a major event like a concert or football game is going on is near impossible without clear instructions. As a result we wound up using valet parking (and paying for it). Problem 2: and this is the big one... the door on my hotel room could easily be pushed open without having to use a key! Called down to inform the hotel of the problem...20 min and no one showed up to fix it. Called down again... 30 min later and no one has shown up to fix it. Called down a third time and after 15 min of waiting I had to go down and ask why no one had come to fix the door. It was dinner time and being trapped in our room seemed counterproductive so I asked for a new room which we thankfully got but the experience in general left a very bad taste. Additionally you can just see the age in the old building now. Peeling wall paper old stained carpet etc. I think its time to start looking for a new favorite place.
30,I am eligible for upgrades and check in they say that there are no upgrades available for the entire hotel. Also at check out I forgot a work phone in the room and it was very difficult to talk to anybody in person or after 8 PM when my flight landed at home.  It is now three days later and I still have not received my phone that I needed overnighted the first day
50,This was one of the best Vegas experiences I have had. I got the penthouse suite on the 61st floor and it is definitely better than just getting a regular room. You have two bathrooms and plenty of space for the family. I strongly recommend staying at Mandalay Bay not only for the pool but if you are attending events at allegiant stadium it is a nice short walk
40,This hotel provides you a lot entertainment is clean and well maintained. The price was very competitive compare with other hotels of his magnitud. Out of all the hotel I stayed in Vegas is so far my favorite.
10,People in the neighboring room were constantly getting high. The smoke was coming in to our room  All day long. When I called to ask staff to do something about it they were extremely rude. Will never stay there again.
30,Very friendly staff from check in especially from the staff wearing blue. Rooms are far from sound proof. Shared door experience was not good as we couldn’t get any sleep from neighboring guests. Bath tubs could  Be cleaner. I saw hair in my tub. Also not the best location. Def need tram to be convenient
50,Idk what it is about this hotel but it smells amazing staff was very nice and helpful. Will be returning for future trips to Vegas love how close to the stadium it was. Makes our trip easy fun and worth it!
50,Mandalay Bay is the best resort on the strip. Friendly staff amentities galor and is easy to get in and out of compared to other strip hotels. Staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Citizens is the best breakfast in Vegas!
30,Rooms smell. Needs updated. If you go into the virgin there are people cleaning everywhere and the place shows. Not the case at the Mandalay Bay. They never had enough washcloths which is weird. It used to smell like coconuts years ago throughout I was said that it does not anymore
10,An incident occurred in a restaurant that led me to being accused. I was detained for over 2 hours only to be released and then evicted when both the police and security staff were given evidence I hadn’t done anything. Instead of apologizing I was evicted pretty sad that the tough little boys in security couldn’t just say our apologies.
10,Overpriced and value was terrible front desk was disrespectful and didn’t want to help please refund my stay Asap thank you also throw in a free 3 night stay and also waive all the resort fees and taxes thank you
50,This hotel is in an excellent location close to everything. The rooms are really nice and spacious. The amenities are also great. The food court has a big selection of foods and great value. This hotel is very nice.
30,We visited this resort for 5 days. We chose Mandalay as we got married in Vegas 15 years ago and stayed at Mandalay. The staff at checkin were lovely the room was super we were on the 23rd Floor. The downside was the housekeeping service it was really hit and Miss we didn’t get clean sheets for the whole of the stay a huge clear bag full of rubbish was left in the room sometimes the room would be made up as expected other times we had towels just shoved on the side of the bath and other times had to hunt someone down to get clean towels. We weren’t given fresh soap or glasses and there were no bags for the ice bucket.    The stay in a whole was good the pool was great and servers were chatty and responsive. We visited a number of cafes and big shout out to Citizens who were great.
30,The hotel is dated. Ice machines did not work. The food at multiple restaurants was fair quality and extremely overpriced. Poor quality drinks in the casino. Although the casino was clean and nice it was cold and had an overwhelming smell of potpourri.
30,Came to celebrate my Husband’s birthday and for the most part the stay was great.. ease of the MGM was great until checkout however the customer service was horrible the entire trip! The hotel was nice casino had a good selection on choices. Late night Restaurant choices not good
50,Cocktail waitresses at Mandalay Bay are very good. One in particular is outstanding Flavia. Flavia is prompt accurate pleasant and always has a smile on her face. I always look forward to seeing her.
10,Casino is outdated in need of repair as many technical issues occured during my stay hotel room lights were out and overall the room and casino had awful smells of cigerettes and industrial strength cleaners. Many of the places we wanted to visit were closed or not available due to private funcations (skyfall lounge) as well many trams were down or broken. The casino itself had minimal game selection and poker room was not really up to standard compaired to the rest of the strip. really disappointed in the overall experiance.
50,The comp rooms are great. But only if you can hold Pearl tier and above. Other den that rooms are spacious and clean. The bed is very comfortable and also like the bathroom with his and her sinks. Would recommend
40,Great property from room to amenities to service during a busy time. I really enjoyed the resort’s technology which made check in/out and the booking of activities during my stay very easy. Casino was fun with lots of gaming options and it was an easy mostly indoor walk to the neighboring hotels Luxor Excalibur and New York NY. Only downsides were restricted room service likely due to staffing constraints and I had to call twice to get towels upon arrival.    The MB has great pools and a fun “beach.” I would just ask that management consider whether they need to make umbrella rental part of their revenue generation (umbrella rental was $150/day) or it umbrellas could be made available for all guests using the pool for a more reasonable rate in an effort to help us all protect ourselves from skin cancer? I know it’s a choice to go to the pool/beach and they have the right to charge whatever they want but it would be a nice signal to send that they want us to be safe while enjoying the amenities we’ve paid for as guests by providing umbrellas more easily and affordably.
20,Nonexistent staff horrible experience at the House of Blues for breakfast and a terrible value to boot and very filthy hallways and overflowing trash containers. Our room needs a deep cleaning and I don't think they've attended to those for a while
30,I stayed at MB in 8/22. We choose this property for the wave pool/ lazy river. Unfortunately the pools were packed with people so we didn’t end up using the facility much during our stay. Also the hotel charges quite excessive amounts for basic items like coffee $6 and a banana $3.25. There is a lack of access to affordable comfort foods. The rooms were nice but in my opinion getting a little dated. The room does not come with a refrigerator. Parking is also an extra $18 a day. We toured all the hotels and next time I think I would choose the Venetian since they have so many food options more stores and no parking fees. I would also consider an off strip hotel for ease of access. It was not the most convenient to have to find and scan your parking card and walk a long way from the car to the room. And then to have to scan your card again to go up the elevator. The hotel is convenient to allegiances stadium and events at Luxor or Excalibur. It just feels like a giant monolith with no personal contact and astronomical prices for everything. Come to Foxwoods or Mohegan Sun in CT- you can go to the real ocean and the prices are half.
50,Excellent hotel including restaurants housekeeping service and pool facility. Enjoyed the Lazy River and the Wave Pool. Plenty of lounge chairs throughout the pool area. We also enjoyed playing in their Poker Room.
30,Don’t look for room service or any dining after 10 pm. Very disappointed not to have my extravagant breakfasts in bed and after a night out a grab and go plastic wrapped sandwich was a big let down.
10,Website states pool closes at 7pm I got kicked out at 6:45pm by a security guard and a cop with his hands on his gun. No one was able to enforce the actual close time of 7pm instead the pool employees have made this an unofficial practice don't waste your money here.
10,Paid for wellness room; upon check in no rooms and increased rates after paying deposit on room.  Parking was to be added onto room key - this was not done.  Resort fee does not include basic gym as previously. Most disappointing stay at Mandalay Bay. Casino was “dirtier” than ever.
50,The pool area may be the best on the strip. The rooms are very clean and a great value for the money. It’s at the end of the strip so that’s the only inconvenience. The staff is very nice and the table limits are very reasonable.
20,Room air conditioner was quite loud with a whistling noise and could not get the room to cool down. The mattress was uneven and uncomfortable. Not a restful night. They need to get new mattresses as I have had this issue in a number or their rooms.
40,MB Resort is beautiful and the staff are invariably professional and friendly. I did notice my bed is starting to sag a bit and the shower stall floor was a bit stained and miscoloured. Additionally some of the appointments in public areas are starting to look worn (carpets elevator buttons etc.). These are minor points however and may be a function of staff shortages.
50,Beautiful property. Loved the lazy river and view from our room. Self check in was a breeze. Never had to wait in any lines to check in or out. Would recommend to family friends and we plan on staying there again.
10,"I specifically upgraded to a Stay Well room to ensure the room was purified and clean as I have severe dust allergies. I called twice before my arrival to ensure I was able to get this specific room and that it would be cleaned thoroughly. When I checked in and entered the room I found a used dirty q-tip on the floor beside the bed. I understand people make mistakes and I know the cleaning staff are likely incredibly busy with such a large hotel but for the price and type of room it was not a great experience. What made it worse was when I asked for them to remove the charge to the upgraded ""Stay Well"" room they originally refused so I had to go back and forth for longer than necessary with their guest services. They tried to be helpful but clearly their policies made it difficult for them to try and make the correct amends in an efficient way when a problem arose."
50,Arriving was easy & convenient. Able to check in with the mobile app from my phone room was available exactly when they said it would be. I parked went directly to my room using my phone as my digital key card and just like that I entered the gates of heaven. The beds were plush the pillows were cloud like and the room was cool and inviting. I dropped off my luggage and away I went to check out the casino and the amazing restaurants. Mandalay Bay is located in a perfect area as it has the best foods minutes away from either a quick Uber ride or walk. The pool was clean and refreshing. The service was A+++ and everyone was very friendly and accommodating. The Eye Candy Bar/Club played excellent music all night and the service was outstanding. Upon getting ready to check out we ate breakfast at the Sea Breeze Cafe (Top Notch) and I checked out via the mobile app and away we went. It was fantastic to have be able to go to heaven and come home again. Thank you Mandalay Bay! It was a true pleasure. We will certainly be back.  Travis Baldridge
30,We Reserved a suite - A/c would not cool that size area  sofa sleeper had no sheets blanket had to call housekeeping and no frig for us to use for our own drinks. Frig in Unit stocked with Hotel items and could not be moved or you would be charged.
50,The hotel is very very nice. Had a few glitches with the digital key but when reported it was taken care of. Very friendly and helpful staff. Just wish it was more handicap friendly. Mobility scooters can be rented but travel from one building is hard to find elevators.
30,We booked a media suite back in May of 2022. we had glass in the carpet and the room reaked of marijuana. While we were asleep someone deliberately bypassed the DND sign and blasted an airfresher in there that caused choking and eye irritation. We followed up with Mandalay Bay they provided a free stay. We went again in August 2022 and the Media in the Media room was not functioning the icemachine across from our room was flooded on arrival. They would not provide a similar room. The bar and workspace was non existent and the sqft was smaller. Also the sheets were so old and felt like sand paper. Maybe it's better to stick to a standard room or find another place to stay.
50,Beautiful hotel with access to attractions. Pleasant staff who were helpful. Enjoyable casino with pleasant dealers and gaming. Cafe was average for casual dining but several restaurants in walking distance. Overall a very good experience. I would stay here again if the opportunity presents.
50,I am a groomer and come to superoo every year. This was our first stay at Mandalay. Excellent experience. Loved the room and check in/out was quick. Had beautiful pool side view. Will definitely stay here again next year.
50,Great price ..Clean ..beautiful room ..huge bathtub and restroom ..easy to check in ..nice & helpful staff ..lots of amenities..wave pool and aquarium..lots of shopping and restaurants near by even if your vegan. IDK PIZZA is vegan friendly and so fresh and delicious.
30,Stayed here the past few days in a Stay Well room. Highly disappointed that there was not a fridge or microwave in the room. Housekeeping was great! We were there mainly for the Beach. We did pay full rate for two days of cabana use and it was worth the money.
50,Loved the location!! Easy access to other hotels. Staff very friendly and accommodating. Room was immaculate and beds were very comfortable. Ate a several restaurants in the hotel and the food at all the restaurants was delicious . We’ll be back to this hotel .
40,Other than the towels there were no issues with the actual room. Just thought it strange to have a few dirty towels and NO wash cloths. I did experience the smell of weed in the hallway a few times but never identified who or where it came from. Other than that the room was great and the 59th floor wellness floor was pretty nice. Hotel and amenities are great.
10,No zero rating ? Mandalay Bay/Luxor charged my credit card 3X for the Carrot Top show. Been transferred between Box Office and Accounts Receivable with no resolution. I provided the POSTED bank statements and they are doing nothing about it. What really irritates me is that we offered to pay cash but they did not accept cash to purchase tickets. Charges made to my card were $665 which should only have bee $150.  Been to Vegas a few times. But this is my last. There is NO customer service especially in a customer service industry. I will be filing a complaint with BBB I also submitted a Fraud form against MGM with my bank.
20,Reservation wasn't linked properly even though l confirmedit was prior to leaving the front desk. My room key expired and i had no idea till it was too late. My kids had to sleep in the hallway floor while I went to fix the issue. All I got was excuses from the staff instead of a sincere apology.
50,Stayed here for 7 nights with a group of friends (23) of us. Travelled to Vegas for Stag/Hen doo's and a wedding all in one week. Casino and hotel was as expected very clean and the rooms were great having seen Queen twins to corner suites with strip views throughout our party.    Pool facilities are in abundance and the man made beach is great for relaxing with a little pool beats playing to keep the holiday atmosphere going. Even on those rough morning after days.    Only downside is it id the last resort on the strip and feels a bit far out. There is a free metro that goes from within the hotel itself through the Luxor to New York New York which helps!
40,I always enjoy Mandalay bay during the weekend wouldn't bring kids pool is too crowded I was here for convention kids and wife stayed and used facilities Saturday was way too crowded for family fun rest of the days were great had few mishaps during trip ice machine did not work and key only works to get u to your floor so was very inconvenient elevators also don't always work with key can be annoying ac in my room wasn't cooling that well so that was somewhat inconvenient I talked to staff at checkout about few things that made my stay sub par to previous visits and was compensated with a small credit but more than that was treated with respect and made to feel appreciated as a customer wich will in turn make me once again a return customer
50,We stayed in Mandalay Bay for 4 nights and we enjoyed every bit of it. Check in was easy with normal wait. All the staff we encountered from front desk house keeping and other areas of the hotel were helpful and friendly. There are food options that would suit every budget. The pool facilities were awesome. The whole family loved spending our mornings swimming and just enjoying the water. We encountered a problem with the water closet of our room and were promptly assisted and moved to a different room. We also made use of the tram and the connecting ways to go from one resort to another it was easy to navigate even with a stroller. Mandalay is at the south most tip of the strip and it can be tiring to visit other resorts but you can always use Lyft of Uber. Overall we would definitely go back to Mandalay Bay.
50,This place is great for kids and couples together  Food is amazing pools are wonderful I would recommend this place for anyone with kids    It is not in city center yet you do not have to leave the resort
30,The resort and hotel is actually very nice but we had a lot of issues in our bathroom. First night we noticed that the shower was plugged. We called in and asked for it to be fixed the next day. The next day we came back from the pool and noticed that it’s still plugged. Ankle deep in water when showering. We called in and they said they had fixed the sink. We had to delay taking a shower till the evening until it was fixed. The the next day the toilet was plugged for no apparent reason. They sent someone to fix it later that day. Ice machine on our floor wasn’t working for two days. Someone else mentioned the same situation on their floor. If these things didn’t happen we would have given a very favorable review.
30,Went in there for my husband‘s birthday and hoping that it wasn’t as packed but the floaty pool was ridiculously packed packed and the towels at the pool room nothing spectacular. The staff at the convenience store and at the breakfast Place were the best and they acknowledged his birthday and provided drinks.
30,Average hotel. House keeping standards are not the same for each room. My friend room had 2 trash bins. My room had one with no trash bag inside. My friends room had water and wine glasses. That were cleaned daily. There were only water glasses in my room. House keeping did not clean them. (We booked the same type of room) My used towels were removed but no wash clothes replaced. I needed a covid test to return home. Called front desk to find out if the hotel offered it. I was interrogated on why I needed. The agent told me the hotel didn’t offer testing and I would have to go to urgent care or a hospital to get a covid test for travel. Later that day I was exploring the hotel and saw a sign said covid testing available a shoppes at mandalay. I could of had my test done right in the hotel!!! I asked front desk for directions on where to pick up my packages. I was sent to the wrong fedex location to pick up my packages. The list of complaints goes on.
50,Great experience we had a mom and daughter trip and it was wonderful we truly enjoyed our stay at the mandalay staff was very polite and kind room was clean we loved the smell of the hotel. We would’ve like less people at the pool it was a bit crowded
10,A great property that is now tired. Hallways smell like pot because of so many smokers and the hotel does nothing. Valet was worst Ive ever experienced. Conceirges (CJ and Joseph) were terrific but they were the exception. Air conditioning didnt work properly. No working ice machine on 3 different floord for a 6 day stay. A nightmare on multiple levels
30,Frontdesk needs to be more friendly and accommodating. Make sure the tv and ac are working before checking in the guest. The best part of this stay was the resort. The kids love the pool.  mini beach abd lazy river .
50,We had a great stay. The strip view room was spacious and had great views. The kids lived sitting at the window and watching the planes and lights on the strip (when we were actually in the room). The pool area was great and the kids loved it!
10,Booked reservation through Southwest Airlines. Arrived and informed that the hotel was overbooked and shifted over to Delano. Only rooms available where NOT what we paid in full for through Southwest Airlines. We were promised the following day they would have openings available which was not actual. They offered $50 in credit but forgot to apply it to our account upon check out until we reminded them.    Won't go back or use Southwest Airlines to book reservations.
20,Because of the affiliation w Allegiant stadium we happened to roll into town right before a large concert so traffic was terrible and getting to the valet was difficult. Once checked in we were given a room right next to the ice/vending machines and told there were no other rooms available and it was noisy all night. Looking out the windows was not the beautiful view but ledges that were filled w debris and bugs and disgusting to look at.
50,The pool area is the best we’ve encountered in Las Vegas by far. Room was large and very clean. In house restaurants and staff were also very good. I would definitely recommend staying here and can’t wait to return!
20,The safe did not open had them come up twice had to wait 2 hrs for them to come up next time was 7 hrs still not fixed then sunglass and money taken from room they filled out report nothing done to offer some sort of reimbursement
50,If you’re wanting to have fun a great experience amazing pool parties and nice Vegas on the Strip experience you gotta stay at Mandalay Bay or as I like to call it Mandalay Yay! This is because their customer service is top notch your room will get cleaned everyday and the property has so many great attractions!
50,Four day night with the family. Loved the large rooms Mandalay Beach variety of restsurants wonderful staff and location . This will be one of our top strip location stays in Vegas. As an MGM Rewards member this is one of my new favorite hotels.
50,We have stayed at Mandalay Bay hotel and casino probably 13-14 times since 2008 and love it. The location on the south strip to us is much more peaceful. And the tram that runs from Mandalay to Luxor and Excalibur saves so much walking.
40,The hotel was classy and in a great location! Close to the airport and taxi was ready when we were ready to go. Nice tram to get to other nearby hotels. Loved how easy it was to get to a concert at Alligent stadium within walking distance!
50,From Check-In with the help of Ivan at priority check-in desk to the last day of my stay it was a great experience my room had a nice view of the strip for the price I paid my room was also very clean & cleaning services was great too the hotel was also very nice & clean all around will definitely be staying there again when I return to Vegas Thanks
10,I took my daughter and 2 granddaughters to Vegas for a fun 4 days. Our room was very expensive overlooked a parking garage no fridge for kid’s milk no microwave for there expensive dinner leftovers sink was back up and filled with dirty water when we arrived and was fixed until our last day maid only came one day after I called parking garage was filled with stadium goers and I was charged $18 a night for parking concierge only focused on signing me up for their rewards program. I won’t be back. Sad because the property is beautiful.
40,Nice time in Vegas loved the two resorts we stayed at. Mandalay Bay is our go to casino since we don't like all the hustle and bustle of the center strip. Easy walk to Luxor Excalibur and NYNY. Highly recommend all MGM resorts.
50,Mandalay bay consistently provides a high quality experience every time I go. From the spa and pool to the VIP services and suites everything is consistently meeting or exceeding my expectations. Much better layout and restaurant availability than many places.
20,Old and needs a refurbishment - seemed dirty. Housekeeping was very messy in the halls- laundry and carts everywhere and we’re not polite when going through the halls. Elevators broken. Food terrible.
20,They seem to charge for just opening the door or looking at the refrigerator. Main issue was unresolved charges even after speaking with check out staff to clarify the issues. It's obvious nothing was done to rectify.
40,Clean hotel with excellent attractions for kids.  Aquarium experience is a must if you're traveling with little ones and kids just couldn't get enough of the wave pool and lazy river.  Overall great hotel to stay at.
20,I feel like I keep repeating myself in with this survey. I doubt that anything would/will be done but if your really interested you can ready previous comments. Service we horrible extremely loud neighbors vallet guy lied to us room was run down and dirty. Expected much better time for the money we spent.
40,If you are attending an event at Allegiant Stadium we definitely recommend staying at Mandalay Bay. The walk across the bridge is super convenient. The casino has several food options that are excellent choices before or after your event. There are several pool options so you can find something that meets your needs (Adult pool with DJ Wave pool or a couple of smaller pools to just relax).
50,Wow what a wonderful hotel and staff. Check in was easy. The room was clean and gorgeous. The staff went out of their way to ensure our needs were met. I wanted to relax and enjoy some pool and sunshine I was not disappointed. I will be back in the future!
30,we stayed at 14th floor facing great view of the swimming pools. However Saturday night concert at the pool also kept us up until 3am. Lazy river was so much fun for kiddos. But under 110 degree without shades or umbrellas are just brutal.
30,Gambled a lot and room was only comped 60 bucks. Rewards lady kept my ID which according to lost and found is a regular occurance I was unable to get on my flight causing extra problems then they made ME pay to have ID shipped when it was their fault. Crazy!
50,Beautiful resort with a lot of opportunity for fun. Lazy river Wave pool and other pools were absolutely amazing. Prices were a bit high for food and drink but outdoor areas made up for it. Had a wonderful birthday.
50,I loved the clean rooms great service fun pools indoor shopping and easy access the the tram to and from the hotel. I had the perfect girls trip! I would definitely stay here again!! Also appreciate the easy digital key along with digital check-in/out. So convenient!
40,Three pools that are very different and all were enjoyable. Amazing food options. Views from the room were postcard worthy. The casino floor had a great variety. Lots of options but very spread out. Would definitely choose Mandalay Bay again in the future.
50,We had a last min chance to get away. Rooms were the right price. Pool was the reason we picked here. It turned out as good as expected. Pool was fun Room was great restaurant options were great. Once we checked in we didn’t need to leave the property.
50,This was second stay. We chose Mandalay Bay because they filled all of our room requests the first stay and did not disappoint this stay. Wonderful staff great restaurants and cool atmosphere. Self parking fairly convenient. Did not use pool but they have wonderful facilities for their pools/beach area. We will definitely go back again!
10,The room was fine but we experienced daily problems with the parking fees and billing. Everything costs extra including a cup of coffee in the room from the coffeemaker. Don’t like the resort fee - just include it in the total price.
50,Mandalay is great to stay at. This is my second trip to Las Vegas this year and Mandalay never fails. I’ve checked out other casinos/hotels where other family members have stayed and none of them beat Mandalay; well maybe Delano but for non suit rooms they’re the best.
50,Our stay at Mandalay Bay was by far the best experience with staff hospitality and food during our vacation. Highly recommend as check in was very smooth and quick. Staff were very informative and helpful. The restaurants in the hotel were excellent especially The Noodle Bowl where food and staff were outstanding.
30,The pools were great and the service was out of this world.  But we could hear the beat from the nightclub in the room at night.  Also none of the restaurants we visited were any good.  As part of the Luxor/Delano/Four Seasons and Allegiant Stadium complex it was very convenient.
40,We had 5 rooms for our family members. Front desk was fantastic.  One room had dirty underwear and socks left behind! Not the best experience.  Other than that I would recommend this hotel for families with kids. Water in the room was $22 per bottle is little drastic as well.
50,Thank you to the team at Mandalay Bay for making our events so special. Knowledgeable & committed staff who's purpose is to give the best customer experience possible. The food and experience exceeded our expectations.
40,Good location for hotel for what you pay. Love that it had 3 major pools and enjoyed some of the food restaurants. The service provided was not exceptional some customer service were okay. Difficult to find food after a certain time if the evening.
50,Great time at mandalay. Very clean the beds were super comfy. I definitely would recommend for anyone staying at one of the MGM resorts to stay at the Mandalay Bay. The only thing I would have to complain about is how hard it is to get food during later hours and understaffed at times.
50,After deciding to go to Vegas for Sweetie's birthday we were referred to Mandalay Bay by her sister. We spent 5 days four nights at Mandalay Bay and never left the property. Mandalay Bay has many restaurants of different cuisines and styles under one roof. Of course the casino has every type of game. And I will never forget the sand beach wave pool - awesome. Next time we will tube float the relaxing Lazy River.
50,Had a great trip. Border Grill was great place to eat. Pool was enjoyable and relaxing for the most part. If want to use tube on lazy river suggest purchasing at store before go. Rental fee was a little steep for tubes. Shark Reef was also a fun experience. The tram service was ok. Long wait in between trams and it was very hot no air circulation on actual tram. If you have a car better to drive down strip to park at another MGM property if wanting to visit other MGM casino's. Would definitely stay here again in the future.
30,I was there with some family members because we had tickets to the football game. This hotel is the perfect location to walk to the stadium. I had issues with the hot water water pressure & there was no wash cloths
10,Drinking (having a good time) and slots are not a good at Mandalay Bay. I’ve been a loyal MGM customer for years and a bad experience with various random slots. The particular machines like the one in the phot do not change the “bet amount” when selecting different demons…    Instead you must sober up and do math times the bet amount and denom. The error was show to managers. Manager JJ Gitchell told me “that’s how they are”. Not good business practice to have these machines on the floor without fixing the issue. Especially with the whole new push to fight gambling issues and know the rules etc.    If a reasonable person would expect the bet amount to be what it says and it’s different… not good period. Mandalay and MGM you are better than this.
40,This was my 3rd or 4th time coming to Las Vegas and overall I was satisfied with my stay. However I don’t appreciate the fridges in the room having overpriced snacks that you can’t remove without paying. That is my only knock I a fine establishment.
50,Super clean and very nicely decorated room with a huge bathroom and a stand alone tub and separate shower. The view was amazing from the upper floors. Five or six different ways to check out making it very convenient too.
50,We had an awesome time at Mandalay Bay. The $5 live stadium blackjack was super fun and interactive! We had a really good time at the pools even though there were a lot of people it was fun and the service was great. The room we stayed in was large and had a separate tub which is uncommon for a basic resort room. Loved our stay.
30,When I walked into my room there was dirty towels and empty water bottles from previous quest. I was told that they were so short on cleaning staff they only did the bare amount of cleaning. I contacted covid that same weekend
50,This resort is located on the south end of the strip close to the airport with great staff service. It has east access to many areas with staff that are quick to assist you on your needs. Rooms were clean and quiet. It was our first time to Vegas and the resort definitely was a reason I want to come back.
30,The location is great for Allegiant and the overall facility is nice. The rooms are more Motel than Hotel so keep your expectations low. Don't equate the price you pay with the room you get. Things have changed.
30,The hotel needs more card tables. Most of the gaming floor is slots. It’s too far from the center of the Vegas and with the costs of taxi's makes enjoying all Vegas has costly unless you rent a car. Sea breeze cafe was a buffet breakfast without the buffet at a premium price. Other food options were plentiful but the one bad experience forced us off grounds. The pool/ beach area was nice. The room seemed a little dated.
30,This hotel is getting tired. Beds and bedding need upgrade as well as the towels. No wash clothes were offered. Shower was not very clean. Grout had what looked like mold. Definitely could use shower cleaner with bleach. Don't touch anything in mini refrigerator or they charge you ridiculous fees (sensors under products)
50,Excellent ***** will stay again. Amazing pool and great room with a large shower and tub. No inappropriate signs for families and dinner spots were amazing. Shark Reef is worth checking out at a discount price. 🫶🏽
40,I’ve been coming to this hotel since oh my gosh years ago. It was a very good experience until the last time I came I was very disappointed by this individual because not only he was very cocky very unhelpful very unprofessional and unapologetic. Thankfully a manager named Katie was very resourceful helpful and friendly (great customer service) was able to solve the problem.
50,Everything from comfortable bed’s cleanliness friendly staff early check in and awesome pools. Also Easy to reach the middle of the strip by taking the tram. Only thing I’m bummed out about is they have no more buffet but still my go to hotel when I go to Vegas.
10,After waiting 4 1/2 hours for a room and never being contacted I went to front desk and was given a room with a 'running' toilet and assured it would be fixed soon. Found a toilet filled to brim with putrid brown junk and an odor that made the whole bathroom unusable. Nobody ever came to fix it despite additional requests. Moved to a much lower noisier room and separate from my companions. 10 hours without a room with a usable toilet is beyond acceptable.
50,Such a beautiful stay for my family of 6. The pool and lazy river are so fun and big. Staff is super friendly. This whole place is so efficient and provided for a great stay. We will definitely consider staying at Mandalay again.
30,A little disappointing for a short stay. Service was not great. Good selection of restaurants to choose from. Room Service was on point. Had to move to another room since the first room was not clean when we entered. Great resort feel loved the pools and the wave pool. No Concierge on duty during my stay.
50,At first glance Vegas seems a plastic place where everything is a fake but people living here knows it's the most authentic experience you can do in US: a dream in the desert. Mandalay Bay is a dream in a dream: exclusive but not posh let you live an experience far from the crowd of the Strip.
40,Got a great midweek rate on a skyview penthouse suite. Room was not ready until after 4. Room also had granola celery and a pack of opened women's underwear on the floor that we stumbled upon throughout our stay. Pretty clear that the room hadn’t been well cleaned. Beds were comfy pools were great and the casino was not crowded so we had a good time otherwise.
40,Went down for a football game. Room was more than expected. Charges for parking were expensive. Service was great. cocktail service on the casino floor was super slow. never got one drink. All the tables were super high. need some lower minimum tables.
50,Everything was amazing from check in to check out. Jada at the front desk was great. The room was amazing and so were the pools. We will definitely be back! This is my favorite hotel we have stayed in in Vegas!
50,Very clean and elegant. I enjoyed the pool area the casino lounges and the family friendly room. the room was spacious as well as the bathroom. The Michelob arena is beautiful and a great place to watch a game.
20,"to ask 16.00 a night to park is not a good feeling after they call you a ""guest"" we brought snacks and drinks for the room but alas... you cant use it !!! its stuffed with all their way over priced stuff and a sign that reads...... if you remove the items you will be charged 50.00. and stay clear of the sea breeze restaurant. 50.00 with coffee and tip and it was awful wife got ill shortly after."
50,Staying in this at Mandalay Bay was a lifetime experience. Property is very well maintained. People are extremely friendly. You should explore the entire property before exploring anything else at Los Vegas.
40,They charge you $400 to be able to charge your room for restaurants or anything else but don’t tell you I should have asked also but it would have been nice to know. Also for a 4 night stay we had 1 night with with 1 washcloth.I called housekeeping and they did bring us 4 of them and we used 3 of them you would think they would leave them for us to use but they took the clean ones and we only saw 1 more for 3 of us. Called housekeeping again and they said they would bring us some lol hey got to the door and said they were out of them and they gave us HAND TOWELS to use as washcloths.  That was so awkward to use and they said they would bring some and never did so. You would think a hotel with that many rooms would have washcloths.
10,There was no parking spot when the first day we arrived. We were having a baby with fever on car also having a disabled parking proof while we called to the hotel for help. The only response we got was to find a parking at Luxor!! We took 1.5hr finding a parking and my toddler end up throwing up on me..
20,My wife had been wanting to visit Mandalay Bay for a long time so we decided that our 25th anniversary was the perfect time.  Just getting to the check in was a chore as self parking is on the farthest side of the hotel from the desk.  When we checked in the desk agent asked if we were celebrating anything and after we told him he didn't offer any perks for loyalty or such an occasion as we have had offered at other hotels. After asking about upgrades he offered $50 off on a room upgrade of almost $300.  The elevators especially in the self park garage were nasty dirty the floors were sticky and some call buttons did not work.  The room didn't have washcloths or enough towels and everything including the use of an in-room fridge was an additional charge.  Trash room service carts and broken refrigerators were left in the hallway for more than a day.  We have stayed at many properties on and off the strip and this was the worst. we will NOT be coming back
50,Amazing spot near everything in Vegas and 5 min away from the airport. Mandalay Bay has very good restaurants and clubs. You don't have to go outside if you are going to Blackhat. I had an amazing view from my room and very nice pools
10,Was walked in on by housekeeping staff while changing my clothes. They just entered unannounced and I had no pants on when they entered. Room was Disgusting ring around tub and garbage left in room when we checked in
50,Everything was perfect! The family loved the pool and the food choices were great. Location is away from strip but the free monorail makes it easy to get around when you want to leave the complex. Will be back
50,They have a great pool for the kids. Probably the best in Vegas. They have a wave pool lazy river and then multiple regular pools. The kids loved the lazy river. I loved the wave pool it’s cool and refreshing.
30,We loved the wave pool at Mandalay Bay. Loved it! We didn't love that there are no umbrellas to provide shade unless you paid $125 for a chair or $850 for a cabana - it was HOT!!! The rooms were good except our bathroom sink made a weird gurgling noises all night - without water running. We'd still stay again because our 7 year old loved the pool.
30,Lobby and casino clean and spacious. Loved the access to other hotels and choices of pools and places to eat but not impressed with the rooms and frankly over priced as a result. Still advertising buffet on website but they no longer have it.
50,This was a good choice for us bad for the dog. We had to put her in pet smarts daycare. She was too scared. Adult pools awesome good food at the Citizens..awesome strip steak awesome best steak. Lost at casino nice bracelet burlesque show was ok.
50,Mini weekend gateway for a concert and Mandalay Bay was the perfect choice as it’s close by to the new Stadium. Clean room very comfortable bed and has a nice variety of food options and night life!.
50,Great resort within walking distance from the raiders/allegiant stadium. Lots of good places to eat. Rooms were pretty clean and and big compared to other resorts I’ve stayed in. Hotel staff was friendly and patient. Food and drinks at the pool were really good. I will definitely stay at this resort again
50,Had the best time can’t wait to go back. The guy that checked us in was super nice and got us a room with a great view of the strip. The casino was nice and the pools were a blast! Counting down until the next trip
40,Over all very good. I am having a issue re the resort fee and parking fee. We had to cut our trip 1 day short due to a medical emergency back home. I am still waiting for the refund which the front desk said it would refund.
50,We've stayed at Mandalay probably 10-15 time (at least) and overall the experience is always good. Good selection of restaurants in the hotel and nearby. Using the free tram is helpful to get to other venues on the strip (though a little walking may be required). The pool complex is great (though bring back the insulated souvenir glasses so the drinks stay cold longer)
40,Room/bathroom were not very clean. Staff was great and location was excellent. The toilet and shower were dirty. We arrived at 12am and clean it our self. The beds were comfortable but the blankets had alot of hair.
20,We stayed here for 1 night with a comp from MGM rewards this was during a 10 night stay at the Venetian.  Mandalay Bay is much darker/unlit compared to the Venetians lighter/airier decor.  The Casino is much more spread out and involves more walking between rooms restaurants pool etc.  The pool area was the main reason for moving hotels for 1 night during our stay and this did not disappoint lots of pools to choose from including a lazy river.  The room was ok not on the same level as the Venetian but still comfortable non the less.  Mandalay Bay is set at the far end of the strip away from most other hotels and this is defiantly a negative aspect of this hotel.
20,My husband and I stayed at Mandalay Bay Sunday august 14 2022 specifically for the raider pre season game. We took the tram after the game to visit the other mgm resorts. Luxor Excalibur. We went from Excalibur to New York New York. After New York we were followed back to the team at Excalibur while i was being recorded by some perverted male. I spotted him recording me my husband confronted him and he continued to follow us to the express tram at Excalibur back to Mandalay bay. We felt uneasy and left the tram area and walked elsewhere to get away from this individual. Let me inform you this male individual had a Mandalay Bay pool staff shirt on. He was belligerent drunk when we confronted him so we didn’t want any more problems. I reported this to a security member two days after we got back i didn’t report at the time because i didn’t know what to do. After a few days it kept haunting me that he could be recording other people without their permission. So i called security. I spoke to a security employee and 3/4 of my incident reporting he hung up on me!! I’ve never felt so unappreciated as a woman when reporting harassment. I’ve never been stalked or recorded before so i lost it. I called concierge and after they apologized they had security manager call me back. Calvin was SO nice and super understanding of what happened to me. Ensured me he would follow up and got ALL the details. Thank you. All i wanted was to be heard!    Now the hotel part. We mobile checked in and felt lost as far as what the hotel had to offer. There was no hotel room pamphlets of what restaurants and shops were around. We had to navigate and research on our own. There NEEDS to be security in the tram areas. ANYONE can gain access to those trams! Riff raff is everywhere in Vegas. We also were begged for money by someone in the Mandalay Bay casino. Where’s your casino security?!!!! The stratosphere hotel had like swat in their casino floor! They didn’t even let us bring a skateboard through the hotel.    I was assuming security would be at their top game after the incident with the shooting. They check your bags at the pool and that’s it. No security walking around the casino i only saw an officer with a drug dog walking through the elevator area. Step it up please. I don’t feel safe coming back to this hotel. The second star is for how Calvin handled my incident report after being treated how i was. Otherwise there was no other reason to stay at Mandalay Bay compared to other resorts. Many others are way more competitive in what they can offer you. We stayed here because of how close it was to the Allegiant stadium.
50,After all these years Mandalay Bay still has a clean open environment great restaurants and the best pool. It only takes ten minutes to walk to Allegiant Stadium making this the most convenient place to stay when catching a game.
10,Took over 45 mins to get our luggage. We had to end up going down to bell desk to get our own luggage as we had reservations for dinner and needed our things to get ready. Could not take the luggage cart when we had luggage bags and drinks with us. TV in room would godark while watching TV. Room never cooled down.
50,We had a blast and everything from top to bottom was amazing!! Great staff food rooms casino amenities transportation and everything else under the sun. Don’t know that there was much that could be improved on. 10 out of 10
30,Mandalay Bay hotel’s location is far from the center of Las Vegas Strip and lack of shops. I picked this hotel because of the pool and lazy river my kids like it. The walking distance to the strip is far we have to take Uber all the time in stead of on foot. The casino does not have baccarat card game also no Progressive bonus to bet. There is only a subway sandwich at the food court. Overall 3 out of 5 on my rating. I recommend Planet Hollywood or Aria better.
50,Most of my reservation was done online thru the MGM app however when interacting with staff they all helpful and friendly. The diversity on entertainment and restaurants keep my family occupied with joy
10,Arrived for 4 nights on july 4th  booked double queen beds was given a king bed. Needed a rollaway bed  the housemen who delivered bed took all the cash in my wife's purse $1340 to be exact . Contacted security and metro police. The hotel not taking any responsibility was promised refund after investigation by front desk manager get follow up email  saying that it's my fault for not using safe in room stay away  at your own risk  keep money with you the staff will take your cash if left out.
50,The room was clean and spacious. The casino offered a cheerful atmosphere. The pool area was one of the reasons we selected the hotel. I was able to use the desk space in the room to work remotely during the day.
20,Water pressure in showers are terrible. Had no hot water to sinks. Didn't replenish washcloths daily. Hallways/elevators to rooms are very hot like no ac there except inside your room. Hotel seemed very outdated compared to other mgm hotels
40,Great hotel and environment if your about the beach pool and entertainment. The rooms were clean the drinks were strong and plenty of places to enjoy yourself. Eye candy is a great bar although there was a mishap with the bill at the end of the night.
40,Tough to navigate especially from the parking garage. And pool cleanliness hours and maintenance not befitting of a property like this. Room show restaurant and staff were good. Too many other better options in Vegas.
50,GREAT STAYCATION!! We’d definitely go back again. It was so much fun! The room pool cabana Aces game staff AND EVERYTHING was great! I would definitely recommend Mandalay Bay to all my friends and family!
30,Too many hidden fees we constantly had issues with our room card to go up. Then parking when we payed for parking . Where we were told it was added to our room and card not working. Was never able to log in to get my points or use my card electronically for my room. Far from the main strip where everything happens.
50,Looking for a fun atmosphere with fantastic service food and gaming not to mention pool shows and have it be the best vacation ever. Go to Mandalay Bay!!! You won’t be disappointed! Again if you don’t go I’ll take your room 😂
50,The ONLY negative thing about my stay was the A/C never really got the room cold and would wake up sweaty at night. Other than that unfortunate thing everything was great. Loved the room and hotel along with the proximity to the Black Hat event.
10,I work in the hotel industry so I can understand how hectic the check in process can get. We checked in about 10:30 AM with my family and I. The rooms weren’t quite ready yet. Understandable so we went off and explored. By hour 2 we still had not received a text that our rooms were ready. We went and lounged by the pool. By hour 4 1/2 we were a bit concerned because a front desk agent did tell us they overbooked our room category. I went and spoke with Maria who was kind and America the FD agent. They had said our rooms were ready and never issued a text.. Which already irritated me. Elevators require a key to access guests floor which is normal. But when we tried our key to access floor number 56 it did not work. We had to have a security guy take us up to our floor. When my parents got to their room there was a guest already staying in their room!!! Also my room as well!!! By this time it was around hour 5 and we were upset. No front desk manager or supervisor came up and apologized for the wait time and matter. Finally 6 hour later we got into our room and the housekeeping associate offered us waters in which we got charged for when we received our folio… I do not advise staying here.
50,If you are looking to have a great time in Las Vegas.  You should say at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino.  They have great pools great food and awesome night entertainment.  If you are going to a concert or a Raiders game this is the place to stay at just a 10 minute walk from the casino floor to the venue.
20,Very dissatisfied with my stay. Paid for something that wasn't even available. Bed didn't have a blanket. It had two sheets. Pretty ridiculous. I had booked over a week in advance and just to arrive to something that wasn't even what I had reserved with no compensation.
30,Great location for attending conventions but on the far end of the strip from anything else. I enjoyed the casino many selections for food with some good and others not. Decent rooms but my safe was broken and plumbing made a constant gurgling sound. My digital room key stopped working out of no where so I can to go back downstairs to print physical keys and then those would not work either and back down to the lobby another time where no one would help me without waiting in a super long line when I was already late for my next business appointment.
50,We booked a two-room suite far in advance and had a bargain room rate that the hotel didn't try to adjust. The room was phenomenal and made the daily uber/taxi into the main strip area worth the extra cost. There is a tram to the Excalibur which is an easy walk to NY or MGM but waiting on the tram got old very fast.  We splurged for a cabana at the pool and even though there were plenty of open seats available the cover and service made our pool day a real treat. Points off for the food at the pool - the pizza logs were seriously awful and the taquito things weren't much better.  The wave pool is a bit tired looking but the facilities feel clean and people were well behaved.  We recommend the Citizen cafe for breakfast (try the BLTA!) over the House of Blues. HoB breakfast was fine but not quite the banging good chow and good service as Citizen.  MB isn't a bright new chic LV hotel but it is very well run and clean.  Our housekeeping crew were like ninjas - in an out without any disturbance.
30,"Unless you feel like paying $184/lb (Yes the bacon jerky was $23 for a tiny 2 ounce bag) $12 to brew a cup of coffee in your room and a 10 minute wait for the elevators only to find that your room card doesn't work so you have to go back to the desk 3x to get a card that works to access your floor... The staff are clueless I was told the gym was closed for renovations and they suggested I take an Uber to an off-site gym that I could pay for myself when the gym was in fact open but had to be accessed by going outside the hotel and around the building which was only relayed to me after I insisted on speaking to a manager. So I wasted 40 min of my time just trying to get to the gym. Also there was a $50 charge if you wanted to put any ""personal"" items in the room fridge. Could've stayed at a 2 star hotel and gotten free water bottles free coffee in the room and elevators and key cards that actually worked! TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE PRICE TO STAY HERE!  I can say the room was clean the air conditioning worked well the oversized bath tub was nice and the bed was comfortable."
50,We came to Vegas for the Raiders play off game. We had a great time. My kids loved their first visit to Vegas. We were in a great location. The only downside was the Wi-Fi connection was horrible. But we will be back for sure. Thank you ☺️
20,"(1) The hotel room has a fridge but it is one of those silly ones where you can't put any of your own items in it and you can't touch anything without being charged. I hate these in every place they exist. I just want to keep a bottle of water cold damn it!  (2) They charged for use of the in-room coffee machine. What?? I have never been somewhere so ""cheap"" as to charge for the coffee pods/cups in-room. Absurd!  (3) Absolutely beautiful pool area. I really enjoyed it on the day I arrived and then never again afterwards because it closes at 6pm!! (My work events didn't finish until 5.30!)"
50,Wonderful place to stay! I thoroughly enjoyed our time here! My wife and I will definitely come back! Great variety of amenities and things to do. The pool area was very enjoyable clean and welcoming
50,I was mad at the team for moving but after a couple of years I decided to make the trip and see the team in their new home.  I was impressed with the stadium and how your hotel managed a seamless family orient and safe passage to and from the stadium. I will be back. Go Raiders.
30,With the plethora of hotels in Vegas I would suggest you look elsewhere. It was fine but not great.    Room was clean and quiet. We had a view of the airport and while you could hear the planes and sirens from the road they weren’t load enough to wake us up (we were floor 58).    The pool was the reason we booked the place. Supposed to be the best pool for kids in Vegas but the hours were ridiculously short. Open at 9am and close at 6pm? If you’re spending the day in the strip you want to come back and then Nj it the pool. It should at least be open until 8pm! As someone else mentioned the wave pool is very infrequent- one wave every minute or so. Very strange. Lots of lifeguards but they were busy chatting or cleaning their nails or staring off into space.    Our main disappointment with the lazy River was the lack of floats. They should provide a certain number of floats that could be used by everyone. Instead you have a buy a float. Seems very very cheap to me for a nice hotel.    Checkin was a bit annoying as i got no fewer than 6 emails demanding i use the app and when we did try to board the elevator it didn’t work. A worker says it ‘has trouble connecting’ when in the hotel. That’s all fine but then don’t send me email upon email telling me it’s easier to Checkin via app.    Overall our stay was fine but I would stay somewhere else next time.
10,I reserved the Elite King Suite at the Mandalay Bay because Blackhat 2022 conference held there upon arrival I was told to wait for the room to be ready.  after more then 4 hours waiting I approached the counter only to hear that my room was doubled-boked and they are moving me to another hotel.  I chose Mandalay Bay due to its hosting the conference and all the convenience that tag along with that.  other than moving me to a regular room (when I ordered the Elite King Suite) another hotel they and giving $20 for the taxi to get there didn't compensate me at all.  I paid all taxi fares that week  not to mention getting to Vegas after a long flight just to wait and wait and wait and only then hear that the room was doubled booked.    will never go back there!
50,Positives:  Great night view of stadium and Mandalay towers.  Bed was comfortable with plenty of pillows.  Bed was nicely made.  Bathroom clean and plenty of towels. Good lighting for makeup. Extended magnifying wall mirror. Shower - good water pressure and plenty of hot water.  Good wifi and mutiple charging outlets.  Everyone in the hotel was helpful in the Lobby elevator and other areas.  I never used any of the pool or outside areas. I never used the TV.  Negatives:  Ask in Lobby at checkin for directions on getting on WiFi.  Room amenities on website should state that:  Room has a non-charge coffee maker.  Room no free refrigerator. No free microwave.  Tried the slot machines but many too difficult to figure out how to use.  From airport buy ticket at the book outside of baggage claim for nice Bus to Mandalay. $15.
30,The hallways and rooms felt somewhat dated as compared to other properties. Several mechanical issues with our room were fixed by staff (loose soaking tub knobs no electricity in the bathroom) whereas one was overlooked - sticking the bathroom door that needed to be slammed closet doors that didn't close all the way and left the interior light shining into the room. They fixed some of the issues without apology but I imagine we will try another MGM property next time (we loved NYNY and Bellagio).    We checked in on my wife's birthday and while I didn't expect a cake and parade - I thought they would at least acknowledge the occasion in some way - but not a deal breaker.
40,Received a free night stay. It's a long walk to other casinos and the restaurants are way overpriced for the quality and quantity of the food. The toilet is extremely loud. Hotel is clean and staff is nice but doubt I would stay here again.
50,They have the best customer service  the rooms are super clean and security is top of the line you don't have to worry of strangers on the elevator or on the alleyway highly recommended the Michael Jackson's show!!!
50,The pool facility was large enough for different groups of people. It had many things to do for families and partying adults. The lazy river and wave pool is fantastic. I appreciated the scanning code on the pool chairs to get pool side service.
20,"You'd think a room titled ""Conference Suite"" would be a perfect choice for a fantasy football draft party. However the Wi-Fi was awful. Owners struggled to do research. The room doesn't have dedicated Wi-Fi access point. In this day and age that a room can be billed as a great place for a conference with Wi-Fi that bad is a joke."
40,Location was perfect for a quick turn around trip for Raiders fans or concert goers. Close to the airport and walking access to the stadium. Staff was nice. Rooms were great! Shops were decent but not for high end shoppers. Also finding hot food onsite after 11:00pm was a bit of a challenge so be sure to grab a bite early!
30,All noted previously. Didn’t not get the room requested did not get an early check in as requested (when I did early check in at Caesar’s I had my room by 11am) had to track down and ask room service for smaller wash rags the iron didn’t work and had to be replaced and …. I still have not received my receipt!!!
50,My daughter and I attended a couple of WNBA games and chose Mandalay for venue convenience. We were treated very well from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. Needless to say this will be the only hotel we will stay in when visiting Las Vegas
40,Awesome Resort with great amenities and lots of stuff to do (nightclubs shows entertainment conferences). Great staff and great accommodations. Guest rooms provide large space and the view was very great
10,Mandalay Bay executive management team please contact me this what is by far the worst hotel experience I have ever experienced . I have NOTHING NICE TO SAY . SPENDING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS to be placed in a downgraded basic room is horrible you should get what you pay for at bare minimum.
10,Could hear the songs so clearly I could sing along. Do not stay on the 28th floor if you’re hoping to actually sleep before 3am. Unacceptable that they did not warn me about the noise after seeing I was checking in with two young kids not there to party. I would have been happy with knowing ahead of time so I could get some ear plugs. Has to do a four hour drive home in less than four hours of sleep.
50,The service was great the environment was amazing I really appreciate the courtesy and politeness from each of the staff members from the moment I was trying to park when I got into the doors when I checked in the housekeepers were awesome and stuff just overall. Were great
30,Haven’t stayed at Mandalay Bay for quite a few years but usually stay at there connecting property Delano. I feel the stay was very average for rooms and service for how much we spent for the room. Did have time to use the pool area during the daytime this trip and my daughter and her friend were disappointed that it wasn’t open later into the evening.
20,Was given a room with a ring around the tub and when I called to speak to the front desk they told me they would send a housekeeping but they never came. Also I was given a room next to a wall it was my birthday and I wanted to enjoy and have fun instead I checked out and went to a different hotel...
20,Don't be taken in by the extravagant exterior and common areas - the rooms and service leave a lot to be desired and are in no way representative of a 5 star resort. The view was nice and the room and bed appeared to be clean but there was duct tape on the bottom of the windows (?).    The walls are paper thin and you can hear every word your neighbor says and all other noises coming from other rooms at all hours of the night so you won't be getting a lot of sleep (if you want to sleep). Housekeeping randomly showed up at our room at 1 am and woke us up to give us extra towels that we didn't ask for the bathroom floor was filthy and housekeeping did not come until the evenings.    The resort is overcrowded and there is trash everywhere - overfilling the trash cans on the floors and stairs and all over the pool area including floating in the pool. There were actually cups and other debris floating in the pool water and all over the pool ledges and no one cared.    Although this is supposed to be a 5 star resort and is priced as such you get the bare minimum included in this cost. Everything you could possibly want is extra including bottled water in-room coffee and the nicer pools with music all extra fees. Be careful with the minibar - I opened the fridge door to make sure it was still full before we checked out and I guess I rattled one of the bottles on the door when I did which notified guest services and they charged me $20 for a tiny bottle of Jack Daniels that I didn't even touch.    It takes forever on the phone or in line to get a hold of guest services or housekeeping and everyone is very indifferent as you are just one of hundreds of guests they will deal with in a day. Drinks start at $15 and go up from there. Even fast food meals from the food court cost $20 a person. Maybe this is just Vegas for you but I'd rather spend my money on something more comfortable that didn't make me want to take a shower afterward. Won't stay here again and do not recommend.
30,"Originally booked a King room and was issued a Double. They would not address due to ""third-party"" booking; however this was not a problem at last year's conference. Also the temperature in the room was warmer than average even after the attempts of their engineer to address the problem.    The Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino has previously been top notched and we have enjoyed our stays. I may give them another opportunity next year; however I will likely look at adjacent properties for comparison."
30,Room was ok prices were high for mini-bar and other services. Issues with availability of cold water. Lost power in bathroom. Starting to look dated. Stayed here to be close to conference. It' a bit of a hike to the rest of the strip.
50,Great service clean room met expectations amenities within a short walking distance great restaurants. great family experience highly recommend this resort. If you like slot machines this is the place to be.
50,My first time in Vegas. the resort was huge. I guess the only negative is it was so big my legs hurt from all the walking for the convention. It all went very smoothly. I wish I had time to enjoy the pool area it looked amazing.
30,Pools look good in pics but for us (kids 1216) it was overrated - lazy river is good for a lap or 2 wave pool waves are too small & to infrequent. Everything incurs a charge - chair in shade using minibar to chill your own drinks.
30,Just give me one restaurant that doesn't constantly blare garbage-y music at me. Just one. SeaBreeze is terrible quality room service hamburger was expensive but awful and charging $12 (!!!) for each cup of in-room coffee is just a rip-off.
50,"I had a wonderful stay at the Mandalay. I came to Vegas on a work trip and just so happened to book there. Although prices are a bit high it is 100% worth the money. The room was spotless and the bed was comfortable. The staff was incredibly helpful and kind and the amenities and food options are unmatched. If you're looking to have a bit more upscale Vegas ""experience"" then this is your spot. If I ever come back to Las Vegas I will certainly be staying here again."
30,I got a call when I landed that I had been upgraded to a room at the four seasons. I was excited to hear that but when I got to check in I was told I was no longer upgraded. The front desk tried to make it better by giving me $100 to charge to my room. I wasn't thrilled but happy to have some free money. To bad when I tried to use it at the pool restaurant I was turned down because my room wasn't able to be charged to. It was extra embarrassing since I didn't have my card on me and had to have my friend cover me.
20,Staff warned that if youaccidentally bump the mini bar it will trigger and you will be charged $50! No coffee... Unless you pay the $50 + $12 per cup! Absurd fees for things that should be complimentary.
40,Very large property all spread out. Curious special access to the pool areas. Hazel Coffee & Cocktails is a great place with wonderful m  live music each evening.  Most impressive place was the speakeasy!
40,I always enjoy staying at Mandalay Bay. Usually have such a friendly staff. We literally didn't see any staff other than those at the tables or working in a restaurant. The digital key is a complete joke and you look like a fumbling fool in the elevator trying to get it to work. Just bring back the keycards and check-in with a friendly face and greeting. The room was clean and comfy and the price was right.
20,Paid extra for early check in at 1pm but wasn't given a room until after 3pm  Was not happy with the bad odor(mildew) in hallways going to our room. Had to use room key in elevator to get to our floor 2 elevators did not properly function using room key. Room didn't have a clean/fresh smell or appearance.
40,No need to bully a family of 4 for stopping to check for directions on my phone. Kids were not near the machines I was. They were in the walk way as lots of other kids are. Also was accused of sleeping in a chair when I was looking at my phone. Again being harassed. So what it was 2am. We were waiting for a limo
50,Beautiful rooms friendly staff and location was fantastic! We went for a concert at Michelob arena and staying here was just a 6 minute walk to the venue! Indoors! Also close to other high traffic and popular areas like Luxor and the Allegiant arena. Very clean too all around!
10,My husband and I eloped to Las Vegas. We married 8/7/22. We stayed at the Mandalay Bay Las Vegas 8/6/22-8/9/22 and it was the WORST experience EVER.    Upon checking in I notified the gentleman that helped me at front desk that I was getting married. I checked in to my room and I’ve attached a video of what I experience during my stay at Mandalay Bay.    Brief explanation obsiviously some type of pipe burst according to what I was told from some of the staff. Upon our arrival to our room as soon as we stepped off of the elevator the entire floor smelled EXTREMELY BAD like sewers or mildew. Several of the floor room doors ( including the rooms directly across from ours) were propped with fans blowing the horrific smell directly to our room. Not to mention we did not have face cloths in our room our ENTIRE stay due to what we were told was “ a shortage on wash cloths due to mgm supplier”    We went to the front desk to speak with a manager whom we notified that we were getting married he had absolutely no compassion and offered to have someone clean the hallway with air freshener which we stated would do absolutely nothing for the horrific smell that overpowered the hallways of mandaly bay. I told the manager no I refused to stay in that room. He told me he didn’t have many rooms and gave us an equal room with a different view from which we booked. Overall awful experience for our wedding day .  Im making a complaint with the BBB and on google as well
50,Great check in great room great pool. I like the location as the tram makes getting around very easy. Awesome casino floor. Variety of restaurants. Also like needing room key to access guestroom floors.
40,Front desk people are nice and helpful . Room is super clean . Checking in and out is such a easy with mobility but posted scanners were out of order most . Information for mobile checking in and out has tobe accurated so less crowded . Overall we love to stay.
50,Every time we come to Las Vegas and stay at an MGM Resort we have a great time and all personal of every resort we stay at are wonderful friendly and very helpful. Their rewards program is the best. We are coming back in October can't wait.
10,The hotel was nice and we chose this hotel for their pool. Pool and hotel were great but someone came into my hotel room while I was at the pool and stole all the cash from my wallet. Needless to say I have very much disappointed that this would happen at a hotel that I paid good money for.
50,The water in the pools are cold which is nice. Over priced lounge chairs with umbrella are $200 I think that's insane. I also think they should add brighter light bulbs throughout the hotel and Casio when the rooms were dark
50,Was on business hotel was super convenient and provided a lot of amenities! It was my first time in Vegas & was nothing short of amazing! I had a beautiful room and view and was in a central location to sight see the strip!
20,Very frustrated stay with several problems. From lack of water on multiple days including upon arrival and on my birthday day not being able to take a shower with my family and flash the toilet prior to leaking. Also had a different room and due to not having evidences the reception was not able to solve my problem nor was interested to do so. Also carpets spelling bad and dirty on the corridos to the room
30,The hotel rooms are a bit dated. Not everything functioned. Sewage smell emanated from bathroom when bathtub is full of water and draining. The outdoor pools were the best features. I'm not sure if I would recommend this hotel.
50,The room was nice great view! We would stay there again. And I would recommend your hotel to my  friends and family. The restaurants were great. Had fun in the Casino. And liked the fact that we could walk to Luxor and Excaliber without having to go outside in the 100 degree weather when we were there.
50,We had a magnificent time. All employees were prompt to respond and courteous the room was very nice and the food was delicious! The casino is a nice size with plenty of games and a nice variety of type and denomination
50,We are so glad to had a chance to go back to your hotel and was very pleased with your service.We had fun hope to be able to do again soon with our big hug soup of friend and family . Hotel staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs
50,everyone from check in to room service was exceptional. Ivan at the front desk made my check in and stay worth remembering. restaurants and service was absolutely 5 star all the way. pools are welcoming and for every desire.
20,I think Marriott could've done a better service.. fridge has lock  broken ice makers  and not just one too many floors of broken Ice makers at least 5 floors that I know of  no coffee/tea maker  the room is set for you to spend more money because they don't want to provide those basic stuffs u need on your stay I guess that's their way of trying to make up for their loss during pandemic. BAD MOVES BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE..OH YEA too many noise and children running around  yelling screaming they should put them in d same floor to enjoy their own mess and noise I have those in my left and right sides  I sure didn't enjoy my stay.
10,Like arriving at a hotel in a desert with no staff or service.  It's obvious at every turn that every system is built to rip you off.  The $22 bottle of water the $26 bag of peanuts.  The room service food is worse than a hospital the rooms are filthy the service sucks stuff is broken.
20,"I stayed here for 4 nights and it wasn't very pleasant. There were so many things that went wrong it's just too many to mention. I checked in with the hotel app and it said to proceed to the kiosks to receive your room key but there are no kiosks. It was early in the morning and no one was in the front to direct people. While my sister was checking in the man helping her told her that I was already checked in and can print out my keys using the ipad at the end of the front desk. Waited for over 1/2 hour for nothing. The water pipe broke in our wing and we were without water for several hours. The wave pool only makes a small wave and the wave doesn't even ""break"" anymore so it wasn't fun like it used to be. I can go on with a few more things but it's not really worth it to mention. The food was okay and the sundries store was open 24 hours which was nice. Staff by the pool was nice as we rented a cabana. I don't think I will stay here again."
40,Visited for a concert at Alligent Stadium the location was perfect for that. Room had an issue with the safe which was never addressed by the staff.  Slots were not lose tables were tuff as well.  Bars were a plus / bartenders were all cool  Floor drinks sucked - had to chase down a floor server - asked for a Bloody Mary - ended up with tomato juice and water - better to get drinks at the bar.  Overall Mandalay is a quality Hotel & Casino - Safe and lots of slots if your into that
50,I love the kiosks to get my room key and mobile check in. Staff always friendly and helpful. We love staying at Mandalay and we love relaxing at the pool and lazy river. Will always recommend everyone to stay.
50,Love staying here in summer. Great atmosphere friendly staff great pool. Staying here provides easy access to others MGM properties and shopping. Plenty of good restaurants if you want to stay on site. Rented a cabana one day at pool and loved it.
50,Great service clean room and very open casino floor! The restaurants were very clean and delicious. I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone I know. Can’t wait to stay again! I’ll be back!
10,No coffee in the room. Many things are closed. Desk hours are limited. Many things are broken such as the door card readers in elevator. What restaurants are open are painfully slow when not operating at capacity
50,Our experience was absolutely amazing. From check in and adding parking it was super easy. All right from my phone. You print out your own keys if you choose to not just use your phone bit you can get keyless entry work just your phone.
40,The stay was good overall but probably pricier than it should have been. The fact that Mandalay Bay is within walking distance to Allegient Stadium is a big plus but the room rate increases greatly on event nights! Restaurants are decent but overpriced. Pool is awesome but again if you want a daybed or cabana it’s coming at a cost that may surprise. For me this property is about location of going to Allegient Stadium. Otherwise I’d head north to the central area along Las Vegas Blvd.
50,Got a 2 bedroom suite comped for 4 nights. This suite is at the end of the corridors. Its MASSIVE ! !    You enter into a lobby area and you are met with a bar type table. To the left is a sitting area facing a sink and fridge. To the right is another sitting area facing the tv.    Left and right after the sitting areas are each bedroom. Mirror images of each other. Large room with a massive bathroom.    ONLY gripe was I didnt feel the doors were secure. I could pull them and there was a lot of give in them.    Apart from that it was a great stay
50,Excellent Hotel The service is excellent. the Personal Incredible The Rooms very Clean The Pool Is Fantastic My family was very happy the Restaurnat and Bars are excellent .Highly Recommendable  I'll be there next Year.
50,Excellent service  great staff. Rooms could use a little updating throughout. Also I’m not a fan of the connecting doors to other rooms either. I prefer rooms with no adjacent doors . Overall great property and I’ll contact to visit
30,Property in need of an update. Mold in the shower. Common areas showing their age. Peeling paint in walls around the pool area. MGM resorts just posted high earnings I don't understand the lack of maintenance. If you are walking between MGM resorts properties on this end of the strip be prepared for 40% of the escalators/moving walkways to be out of service.
20,hallway smelled of cat urine. Cold water would cut out in the middle of shower burning you. The employees were great. We went to a Red Hot Chili Pepper concert for my birthday. First time we traveled after Covid.
50,Amazing room. Will get it again. Always love mandalay! Our three year old calls it home whenever she sees it. Staff is amazing room amazing lupo was amazing prime was phenomenal and my girls love the sharks!
40,The hotel was lovely. Although the room would not cool down to a comfortable temperature. And we are from Colorado! The poolside rental was expensive and not worth it. The drink and food options at the pool were lacking.
50,Our trip was amazing ! Mandalay Bay was an amazing experience our first time staying here. We loved our trip . Our room was great and clean . We had the strip view and it was amazing. Staff was great!
30,Nice facilities and rooms. The pool was great for kids. We were nervous about the reports of leaks and broken things in rooms but that was all fine.    The down sides were 1) how expensive everything was -I have never been to a hotel they charge for water and coffee and they charge $20 for a bottle of water or cup of coffee!! 2) We also struggled with getting breakfast 1 day (30 minute wait for Starbucks) and drinks one evening where everything was booked out to a conference.
20,Didn’t get the two rooms and on arrival can’t move myself to upgraded suite or additional room in my booking  I end up checking out earlier and book myself In Balagio  I have requested everyone possible and tried my level best to stay on same property where my convention is but unfortunately I have not received the services I was expecting from Mandalay Bay staff
40,The hotel is beautiful and clean the bed comfortable but on the firmer side (I love it my husband less so but fine with it) - so I actually appreciated that!    The room would not cool as well as we would have liked - could be because we were on a very high floor. We set a/c to its lowest 65 and it was definitely over 70 the whole time. We had hoped for more cool relief from the august heat! The room lighting is less than ideal to me as well because all lighting is at the top of walls around the perimeter for the bathroom and bedroom or lower table lamps. So when we were tired and hoping for some brightness to help perk up it was not helpful! Same with trying to get ready in the bathroom - not good lighting for makeup/getting ready because it’s such low warm lighting. It is nice for low key calming but I appreciate the option to turn up brightness too!    The restaurants on site/closely connected were fantastic! We dined at Lupo (Italian) and Fleur (French) for dinners Border Grill (Mexican) for lunch Dellas and Citizens for breakfast and enjoyed the fun night experiences at the 1923 Prohibition Bar (speakeasy) and Skyfall Lounge. It helped a ton in hot weather to have so many great places right there! Reservations online were easy to snag day-of and made it super slick for getting in when we wanted to.    It’s at the south end of the strip so it wasn’t as ideal for exploring dining and other things across the strip for those like me who love to walk… August heat is a no thanks for me :). But the on-site options really helped with that! We did walk through to explore the connected Luxor and Ex caliber resorts and a simple street crossing into New York New York. We just decided not to trek through hotels like that for dining/bars. I’ll definitely choose a cooler season next time for more outdoor walking!!!
30,This is my first time staying at Mandalay Bay. I was in an Executive Suite on the 4th floor. The room was nice but there was a plumbing issue with the toilet. Multiple times during the day and during the night it would start gurgling for no reason. Some times the gurgling would cause dirty water to spill over and onto the seat. It's loud enough to wake you from sleeping. Because the resort is so big it's very difficult to talk to anyone. The lines for the front desk are always long and you get no where with a phone call. We just dealt with it for 5 nights.    Before going we had reserved a bed by the Morea Beach Club pool ($400 for a Monday). When we arrived at noon they were closed. They said it was because no one had showed up before then and they didn't have many reservations that day. Huge disappointment. We ended up renting a cabana at another pool. We did that for 2 days. The pool side service was poor. If you wanted a drink you may have to wait 30-45 mins before seeing the attendant. A couple of times we just walked to the bar and ordered ourselves.    The casino was nice and clean. The wait time at the cashier was never long. We ate 2 times at the Asian restaurant KUMI. The service and food were both good. We ate one time at Aureole. It was nice and the food and service were both very good.    Checking out wasn't as easy as it should have been. They had double charged me for two days with the resort fees. The lines to checkout were very long and I opted to just do the quick kiosk check out even though I had extra $84 in charges. I took the chance that I could call back later and deal with it. Luckily I was able to call back a couple of days later and they refunded me with no issue. It was so quick to refund and they didn't even question it so it makes me think they do it often and just hope you don't notice. You have few options to communicate with them. The only real way is in person at the desk or over the phone. They don't have a chat or other electronic messaging option.    Overall it was nice resort and I may stay there again. Just be aware that you're on your own and hope for the best. They don't have great customer service.
20,The gym is very small in size has very few bodyweight exercising tools some of the weights are missing. Worst gym amongst all the Vegas hotels felt like I was in some rural area with very basic needs.
30,All of my comments I included in the survey. Great stuff from the concierge desk but the housekeeping needs to be consistent with their times including and the front desk just needs to be a lot more personable.
20,Our plane was late and the room still wasn’t ready after 9 pm. There was a surprising security deposit of well over $500. The pool closed early. The water was shut off almost every night. The ice machine hardly worked. The room comes with a fridge that we couldn’t use because it’s stuffed with overpriced drinks for sale. The bed cover was soiled. The room configuration doesn’t allow bathroom privacy. One good thing the doormen were friendly.
30,Our restroom smelled like urine despite being cleaned twice and a lil dusty around the crown molding😫…. And to our surprise the wave pool only releases ONE wave about every five minutes…. However the best part of the hotel is the wave pool & lazy river. There’s NO complimentary coffee or mini frig space w/o a fee…
20,I have previously stayed at Mandalay Bay and had nothing but good reviews.. However the last time I stayed in August 2022 I checked in to my hotel room only to arrive to a room with makeup on the pillow and the restroom having a strong smell of urine. I called the front desk to have my room switched and they did quickly. I arrived to my new room which was clean however the room next door was being cleaned with the door wide open with a strong mildew smell coming from it. Since our actual room was clean and we had plans we stayed with the new room. Unfortunately the room next door stayed with the door open the entire 2 nights we were there with the strong mildew smell coming from it. I've never had issues at this hotel in the past but I may reconsider staying at Mandalay Bay again.
30,Our Room was gross Hallway smelled moldy. Blowers on the carpet int he hallway the entire 5 days of our sta. The Pool food and staff where awesome. Location was great. Lots of things to do. Easy to get around.
20,Stayed at Mandalay Bay for 5 nights. The water was turned off from Mid-night to 8am more than once and periodically throughout the day. TV did not work. Could not get through on phone to customer service and lines at front desk were more than an hour wait. Pools were overcrowded. Too expensive for no service.
10,My room has a staple sticking out of the carpet a leak from three floors up and the water was shut off before 10pm. I had to book another hotel that night because the staff told me they could not help me they wanted me to move to a different room that they could not confirm was flooded nor was the water working. I was with my kids and wife and had to book another room at the Mirage because Mandalay would not do so they told me I had to wait to speak to VIP services which did not open until 8am. I ended up spending over 345 dollars more on my hotel because I had to leave the Mandalay since my room was flooding with water the carpet and curtains were all wet. I did not receive any compensation and the trip was almost a total waste. I'm not sure why a company of this size does not have a disaster recovery plan that includes relocating customers to another MGM resort if a room is not available for a paying customer. The Mandalay should have put me up in a sister hotel for that night until a suitable room was available instead of making their customer pay an additional 344.68 so they can sleep. I hoping someone will contact me to resolve my issue so that I can update this review with more positive feedback and I'm hoping the company will revise its disaster plan for any future issues. What the point of a company owning multiple hotels if they don't work together to provide better customer service.
10,Be prepared for an absolutely rude staff. They made our family overnight fun at the pool experience a total bummer. Don’t expect to check in at 3p according to the attendant the check in “begins” at 3 but can go as late as 7p-8p!
50,Room was spacious bathroom was spacious also only thing I’d say was bad was the air conditioner didn’t spread all the way through the room it only hit one spot so it made it kind of hot when trying to sleep in the night but house keeping was great they asked more then once if the room was ready for cleaning the shark reef was cool too and there was a lot to do in the hotel besides gambling
50,It's been a while since we have been to Las Vegas and staying at Mandalay Bay was a treat. Checking in was easy since you can do an online checking in now. The room was not nice and clean and the restaurant food were really good.
10,Bad management and service no housekeeping for our entire stay. Had to call for fresh towels toilet paper and shampoo and rude responses to our requests for room cleaning and housekeeping. Spent way too much time on hold on the phone trying to get the above taken care of on my vacation!
10,Being a client since 1999 I've seen many changes in the hotel. But ultimately if feels like chaos instead of a relaxing place to stay. In comparison there are many other hotels that offer better service overall for your money.
30,PRO: Online check-in process was easy and quick. Its the closest major hotel to the airport and accessible to the strip via a short tram ride which brings you as far as (Tropicana& Las Vegas Blvd.) without paying for UBER. Lupo restaurant had the best customer service which reminds you of the hospitality you used get in Vegas at a 4 star hotel. Black out curtains were helpful with getting a full night sleep. Good noise control. We never heard our neighbors or guests making noise in the hall. CONS: Bags of linen and towels were left in the hallway on more than one occasion and a broken refrigerator was left in the hall for most of the day. POOR WATER PRESSURE- regardless of the time of day or night the water pressure would shut off. Literally going from hot to cold or full pressure to no water at all while showering. Quite annoying.STRIPSTEAK: Tasty fries but definitely overpriced and lacking decor. Despite the dim lighting the stains on the chair covers couldn't be missed. Perhaps a little more elegance and stricter dress code would have made our romantic dinner feel like the close to $300 bill for 2 was worth it! There were other little nuances such as shoes and trash left in plain sight at one of the bell hop desks a bathroom odor when passing through the walkway to get to the elevators and lack of customer service at Citizens. Overall I must say I was quite disappointed and definitely plan to stay at another hotel during my next trip.
50,Had a great time at the Mandalay Bay. The ease of check-in was great and use of the digital key was very convenient!  Looking forward to returning to visit. The live music was great and the restaurants were very good!!
50,My husband and I stayed here for a week. The resort was clean and well taken care of. The pools were great and staff was there to bring you any food or beverages you ordered from the menu. Room was very large and clean.
50,Whether you like to gamble eat or lounge around. Mandalay Bay has it all. No matter what you do it’s a winning choice! Become an MGM rewards member and earn free stuff for the money you spend or get an MLife credit card to earn free stuff on everything else you buy!
20,Our first big family vacation ever with Mandalay Bay being the highlight instead we were disappointed.  Many of the fixtures in the bathroom leaked water of didn’t work (exhaust fans) HVAC system couldn’t keep up and someone else’s dirty shirt was in our closet.
30,Guest room was not provided. Pool hours closed early how can you close a pool at 6pm with daylight and more than 100 degrees outside? Also not too many personal around to ask questions. Resort fees are high.
20,They charge you $50 to store items in the mini fridge! signage says one price only to find out you are being charged more (parking garage). Update your signage if the price for services goes up! the pool closes at 7pm? its over 100 outside and its still light out for 2 more hours?!? if you are planning to spend any amount of time on the strip take the tram even then being on the far end of the strip it is still far from a lot of other attractions. we had dark hairs and standing water in the tub as soon as we walked into our room makes you question cleanliness...
20,No running water for our restroom on our floor half of the time during our stay. Called front desk to ask for another room they were not truthful and said the whole hotel water pipe was shut off which we knew was a lie because our other room had running water.
10,If I could give this hotel zero stars I would. We stayed at Mandalay Bay on Aug 6th the next morning a guest walked into our room while my wife was still in bed so obviously she was given a key by the front desk. I told her this room is still occupied so she quickly left. 5 min later a lady from housekeeping knocked on our door and asked if I checked out on the TV which I replied NO! she left but 10 min later another lady from housekeeping walked into our room without knocking which now my wife irritated yelled at her. The lady said that this room is marked vacant which I replied it's obviously not! I visit Vegas 5 to 6 times a year and this is the first time this has ever happened.
50,The hotel restaurants and slots met all of my needs! The weather was great and we were able to enjoy the pool and lots of shows! There was something to do for all of the wide ranging ages of family members. We had a really great time!!!
50,The rooms in THIS HOTEL ARE proper and lovely: They're all good-sized  very spacious with huge upholstered headboards high beds with firm mattresses and a beautiful view . I loved the All day Buffet . Amazing
30,I've never been to Vegas so my initial choice was to stay at the Mandalay just to have a complete experience. I've been to resorts before and the resort was mindblowing. Just beautiful. The staff upon arrival was not friendly at all as the girl at the counter asked if we (my friend was with me) we're platinum members as if we didn't look like we did and we were directed to another line only for her to call me to check me in. The rest of the weekend was more of the same with some of the restaurants the worst plates food stuff that looked like it was frozen and just dry and tasteless once heated and calling it taquitos. The server tried to rectify it but the experience was not close towhat was expected. Hopefully if I do come back it's a better experience but it's very unlikely for the price we paid for the weekend.
50,Everything is great at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino. Steve Decastro with VIP services and Mike Piranio at the Race & Sports Book are outstanding in everything they do for you as a guest. You never have to leave the property to have a great time. Dinner Gaming and entertainment is awesome. Take your partner dancing or look at the great views from atop of some of the activities they have.    Ken Joseph
50,The pool hours are shorter than I expected. If you want to stay at the pool at the night yu should check out the hours. In my case on weekday they closed the pool at 7pm. It still hot and sunshining.
50,Thank you for being so accommodating and letting us make awesome memories even though there was flooding  Mandalay took care of us and upgraded our room so me and my family can have a memorable stay !
30,PROS: the hotel layout is easy and simple to get around love the parking garage the hotel itself is located at the end of the strip away from all the chaos and the wave pool    CONS: dirty dirty dirty. Both on this and the last trip I had I booked general nonsmoking room with 2 queen beds. The carpet had crumbs and debris the bathrooms were disgusting with urine stains on the toilet seat hair in the tub. one of our trash cans was missing and we requested extra towels and a bin and never got them. I know the secret with hotels and motels is that things are not as clean as they appear but mandalay cleanliness is lacking to the point of not evening pretending to try/cover up. Also I received extra fees charged after a final invoice was printed during checkout. vegas had monsoon and storm warning and cancelled all flights so we had to drive 7 hours and not fly 1 hour but check-in staff seemed to hesitate to refund resort fees when we never even used the resort the first evening. Also the hotel was overbooked and insanely crowded - and with the lack of room prep and cleanliness - I would think staff would be understanding to refunding a night that one DID NOT stay in a filthy room.
50,Came for three nights for the Evolution Fighting Game Championship. Easy access to the convention center and to the arena. Clean modern rooms. Very comfortable beds and bedding. Lots of choices for restaurants and food court food.
30,A poor experience with my stay. There’s a charge for every imaginable thing. Staff not knowledgeable about amenities throughout the property. Always handing off to another staff member. Most helpful person was the concierge after that it’s down hill
40,We stayed a room for 4 nights so we could walk to the new stadium for the Red Hot Chili Peppers concert. The staff at all of the venues were excellent. They have the best staff from the pools casino restaurants shops front desk housekeeping.  We really enjoyed our stay at Mandalay Bay.  A few tips: bring your own tubes for the lazy River they will blow them up for you. Citizens is the best coffee place. RESEARCH FOOD PLACES THE FOOD IS NOT GOOD AT MOST PLACES except the pizza place and citizens.
50,They have the best pool and the casino smells amazing!! Rooms are clean and nice. The staff is friendly and very professional!! Highly recommend this hotel and casino!!! The food there is great too with many options!! Don't miss the Foundation Room for adults. This bar is at the top floor with spectacular views of the strip!!
40,Great place to stay with a lot of activities for the kiddos. We were really cold with the AC in the casino area and the pool area does get crowded but otherwise a fun getaway at Mandalay. The restaurants and the aquarium were a hit with the kids!
50,We enjoyed everything about our stay with Mandalay Bay. Our room was clean and comfortable. Excellent location. We were able to bring our dog. Staff extremely helpful and kind. Pool was super fun. Extremely positive experience.
30,Place was nice and rooms where clean. However the lack of wheelchair accessible options made it difficult to shower and move about the room. There was also mildew at the bottom of the shower which made it concerning to kneel or sit in the shower.
40,Parking ATM late checkout clubs drinks food. Everything costs an arm and a leg. Vegas has gotten so good at extracting value from customers the value of the vacation has gone down substantially.    I had a great time but I am not inspired to return any time soon.
50,Must Stay here for the pools! Wave and lazy river plus the vibe of the pool area was very much like a getaway. Room was clean . Great check in service and the smell when yiu walk in the door was amazing!
20,I used to love this hotel but it seems to be going a little downhill. The ambiance is not what it once was and the citizens restaurant was not very good at all. The service was bad and so was the food. The lazy river area was also lackluster the service was very slow and it took longer to get our drinks. Don't know if they were super shortstaffed but this seems to be the on going issue. My 15 dollar strawberry daiquiri tasted like a virgin drink and it was melted by the time I got it. Such a shame.
20,Tried to do an early check in. They advised I would receive a text when the room was ready. I never received a text and ended up checking in at 3 after talking to the front desk.    They ran out of bathroom towels and when they brought them at 10pm they were stained. (Even though they were clean it was an uneasy feeling.)    Bathroom shower had extreme mold on all of the bottom corners.
30,Attended a sporting event with my 13 yo. Lots of physical activity that started in the morning and went through early evening at the convention center. Food court was our only option during the day. Every night of our stay the water was shut off which left us scrambling to get back to room early enough to shower (on nights we knew it would be off) or letting her go to sleep sweaty and nasty from the day. Best Mandalay could offer was a $100 meal excluding the food court which is where we ate during the day.
50,evo was fun in part because of mandalay bay. the staff was nice and helpful . ive been coming here the past 7 years and its been a blast everytime especially this year returning to the event evolution world finals.
10,Plumbing issues the entire trip! No water at almost the whole first two days. No hot water every day. The water was constantly being shut off. We were unable to flush toilets or wash our hands. Disgusting. We were assured the problems would stop after day two and never did.
30,Hotel was beautiful but for the price amenities were missing. No use of mini fridge. No hand towels or shower mats. And over priced food & drinks. Beautiful but won’t recommend to friends & family…..
50,Great experience very wonderful resort. Will visit again and bring friends. Thanks for everything. Food and service were amazing. The heat is only issue next visit will be in winter months lol....................................................................................
10,This hotel is in shambles. Nothing is working it is is dirty tired and failing from check in to pools rooms service and gambling facilities (or therelackof). We were there 11 years ago and liked it. Since then we preferred staying at Aria and that’s what we should have do this trip as well. Alas we have a small child now and thought this hotel would be more fun with a 4 year old. Little did we know that they would not allow us into the wave pool because our kid is 47” and not 48” despite having both parents present. We love to gamble and their while poker session was closed off restaurants so slow and servers utterly rude (especially their breakfast place). The room was so dirty with sticky carpets failing water and electricity hard to close creaking doors we lost count of how many calls we had to make to housekeeping and maintenance. Just don’t bother with this sorry excuse for a hotel…
50,We had a great long weekend. We loved the VIP arrival program. We visited both clubs within the resort as well as several with in the attached mall. The VIP lounge staff made checking in and out a breeze. We had an amazing time and will be returning.
40,Stay was ok. Check in was a pain our early check in we paid for was not ready on time. Michael Jackson ONE was great!!! Foundation Room had a great view. Citizens food was just ok. Best food we had we at the Mexican restaurant.
40,The beach area was fantastic. The lazy river and wave pool are the best. There is an actual sand area like you are at the beach. The hotel was well kept up. A lot of food choices and customer service was fantastic.
30,For being one of the greatest resorts on the strip I would think they would hire exceptional people to meet high standards. I was so disappointed to find out otherwise. To come across one negative employee would cause concern but three negative employees is just disappointing and disgusting.
20,Great facility and pool. Understaffed everywhere so service is slow. The staff provide the basics but don't try to be exceptional.    Online check in doesn't work.    My card was charged 4 days ago but I still have not received an itemized receipt.    The app is still incomplete. You need a physical rewards card for many things like parking.
10,The staff is very rude. Stay away from this place. Unless you are a family and can summon your inner Karen. They only listen once the problem has extremely escalated. Be prepared to be at the front desk a lot. Phones don't work to get ahold of anyone. Bell desk is a joke DO NOT TRUST THEM.
30,Mandalay Bay has been our favorite Las Vegas hotel for several years. Unfortunately this time around the service was not as expected. Believe it or not we there were 2 days in which the hotel didn’t have running water. The first day totally unannounced and the second day the water stopped running before the scheduled time they had informed us that it would.  I am giving it three stars because I really like the wave pool and the lazy river experience.
30,The restaurant selection is good with very professional staff. Same for the casino.  Rooms are OK although the cleaning seems superficial (hairs in bathroom carpet…); they messed up my reservation giving me a different room and didn’t even try to correct it.
30,"I certainly did not expect my stay at the Mandalay Bay to be worse than some of my other experiences at the Luxor and the MGM Grand but this was certainly a surprise. No complimentary coffee in the rooms a negative experience with ""bias"" during the check in process and ice machines broken for days?    I've stayed at Best Westerns with stronger amenities that didn't charge for simple hot bean juice in the rooms. Also if you have a back that prefers firmer mattresses the beds might be a hard sell because they are SOFT. My back actually hurts after 3 nights.    On the upside the pool areas are pretty cool and there's lots of options for you to choose from for your experience. From the lazy pools to the wave areas all over the place. After being in the pool area for an extended amount of time I would like to rent a cabana next time I'm here to have the full experience.    Oddly enough my best experiences were OUTSIDE of the room itself which is... odd lol."
50,We took our nine-year-old daughter for her birthday. She loved the hotel especially the pool area. She already asked to go back again. There were lots of restaurants at the hotel to choose from. Overall we will be staying there again next summer.
10,My wife and I were in town for a conference and decided to stay a couple extra days to celebrate our 27th anniversary. We arrived on Monday Aug. 1st. and without warning we checked into our room around 4pm and found that there was no water. We called down to guest services and was on hold for 30 mins. I decided to go down to the lobby and find out what was going on. The lady helping with the check in line that helped us initially was there and I asked her what was going on with the water. She very snidly just said there were issues they were trying to fix and didn't have an ETA for the water being restored. I went back to my room and as I was was riding ethe elevator another guest told us that a pipe burst in the spa and it had been out for a few hours. At this point I understood that things happen but we could have been notified via email automated phone call or maybe warn us at check-in...and at least be nice about it. Unfortunately we were not able to shower before leaving for a concert we were attending.  On Tuesday morning we received a letter under the door stating the water was going to be shut off again from Midnight until 8am. At least we were notified but still another inconvenience as we were attending early morning sessions at our conference. We made arrangements to go shower at a friend's room at MGM Grand. Upon returning to room later that day the 2 ice machines on our floor were not working. I alerted an employee that was in that hall and she assured me she would have ice sent to my room. Well the ice never showed up.  On Wednesday night we came to our room late to find that the water was again turned off and not restored until the next morning after 7am. At this point not only was this an inconvenience it was a lack of providing any level of good customer service. Again the ice machines were not working. I rode the elevator to the 24th floor to try and get ice ice machines on that floor were not working either.  Again Thursday we had to go to a friend's room to shower at the MGM Grand. We opted to have our room cleaned on this day. We get back to our room and the cleaning service removed all the used towels and left 2 bath towels 0 face towels or wash cloths. The bed was made but sheets were the same. Throughout the halls on our floor there were bags of used bed linens piled up. Asked a house keeper in the halls if she had any towels to which she only had a face towel. I accepted the hand towel and a bit later unfolded to find that the hand towel was stained and looked used. At this point the experience was becoming comical.  On Friday I encountered the only person that was nice and apologetic. She was a African American house keeper that was over on the 300's. I asked her for a couple of towels and she explained the shortage situation but said as soon as she received some for her rooms she would bring them to me. She did bring them as promised. I had also called down to guest services and told the I wanted hand and face towels. The brought up towels but did not bring face or hand towels. I also asked for the room to be cleaned and a fresh set of sheets be put on the bed after 6pm so that when my wife and I returned to the room we would have refreshed room and relaxing environment. We arrived back 1am and nothing had been done.  After staying in other MGM properties; Delano MGM Grand & Aria this has been the most disappointing experience.
40,"I checked out on Wednesday and its Sunday and I still have not received an invoice for the $400 they charged my room. I don't mind paying it if I owe it but I have NO idea what it's for. This was supposed to be a ""free"" room just pay the taxes and fees which I did. I have no idea what the $400 is for since we didn't charge anything to the room. Everything else was fine."
50,My experience at the Mandalay Bay was awesome easy check in and check out clean and nice rooms friendly staff places to shop and eat and play relax in the sun at the pool work out at the 24 hour gym. Great place for a get away.
10,The room at Mandalay Bay had no water and the toilet would not flush water went down at 12 AM and came back up at 8 AM we didn’t get hot water until 10 AM on acceptable.get off on your floor it smell like sewage.
10,Rip off you charge for coffee in the room. No microwave a fridge you can’t use but full of crap super expensive! And if I move anything out of it you charge $50. The casino with all those tables and slot machines just isn’t enough for the Mandalay Bay they need to get every last one of your pennies.
30,I love the 2 BR suites but not when the phones don't work and aren't fixed after notifying 2 staff members. Also I kind of expect the unit to be cleaned of food stains prior to my arrival. There's more but you get my drift.
30,We are still waiting on the deposit that we had to put down to stay there and they nickel and dime you to death. But other then that it was great. We really enjoyed ourselves and the casino did right by me
30,The Mandalay Bay use to exceed the other hotels with rewards and amenities but not anymore. The rooms are lack luster and out of date. take your money elsewhere for a better deal and room. the only thing nice is the pools. not a good reason to stay here unless you want to spend a bunch of money on hum drum...
50,Excellent stay as always. Suite 61 227 was amazing with great views of the Strip at night...Food at Citizens was delicious and lots of it.The M Life representatives were very friendly knowledgeable and explained everything I needed to know.
50,My favorite hotel in Vegas. It feels more like a resort than the typical hotel/casino. So many excellent restaurant options. The Michael Jackson Cirque de Soleil is spectacular. Ideal for people seeking a fun Vegas vacation.
40,Reserved a cabana on the lazy river and spent the entire day there. Our trip was for our son’s 7th birthday so we booked Mandalay Bay for the pool wave pool & lazy River experience. Room interior was decent though the door to the bathroom was very squeaky.
20,Worst service received so far at this resort. I reported each problem but no one followed up throughout the stay. They offered $80 off of my $1690 bill. It should have been more. I will return to mgm next time.
10,It took hours beyond the check in time to have the room ready. On second day we lost water for 8 hours and even longer to get hot water in our rooms. The hotel wouldn't rebook us into the Delano or any other MGM property that had room with water service. That's unacceptable to expect guest to be without running water for 8 hours.
20,The room had many broken things that were reported and never fixed including the AC. The ice maker on our floor was leaking water and had a large fan blowing constantly trying to dry the carpet. We went to multiple different floors looking for ice and all were broken or out of ice. Parking garage for self parking was too far from room elevators.
10,We booked with a $50 per day food credit which we used at the overpriced beach restaurant and other places at the hotel. On checkout they had no record of the food credit. I had already verified the food credit online and at check-in. The front desk staff had an opportunity to make their error right and chose not to. Interestingly when we checked in the people beside us were disputing incorrect charges on their bill also with no luck. This hotel has an inexpensive daily rate but nickel and dimes customers for everything. There is a hefty charge on mini fridge just for putting your own drinks in even if you don't consume theirs. Not everyone wants to pay $12 for a pop.  Buyer beware.
10,Their 'wave pool' is not a wave pool. It puts out 1 wave every 3-4 minutes. It was VERY disappointing and misleading. I've wanted to stay at their resort for years because of the pool complex. If I had known the wave pool was not a real wave pool I would not have stayed here. They should be clear it is an occasional wave pool.  Also the water was out for hours 3 out of our 4 days there. No compensation or even an apology for the inconvenience. Even one of their 'scheduled' outage started early so the fact that we cut our evening short so we could be back to the room in time to shower before the water was turned off was a waste because we couldn't shower the days sweat grime and sunscreen off. We felt totally gross.  Obviously they do not have any control over a burst pipe but some sort of compensation or apology would have been nice.  We will not being going back to Mandalay Bay.
30,Room was dirty pieces of toilet paper in the bathroom floor made me wondered if the bathroom was cleaned prior to me checking in. Gooey stuff on and between clear top and edge of the desk. I called the front desk they stated they will send someone to clean up everything was the same when I returned to the room I wondered if anyone came or if they did they didn’t address what I related. Found a dirty sock by the bed not ours! There was an issue with another room down the hallway the whole floor smelled so bad water turned off my daughter got sick and threw up multiple times but no water to flush the toilet that was horrible
50,Great experience incredible staff and attentive bartenders. Very nice casino staff. Large rooms with very comfortable beds. Just a bit farther from the other places on the strip but they have the great wave pool if you like to go for a swim.
10,We could hear people talking next door and having sex. To have paid this much to be in a room where you can hear people next door like you were in a motel is unbelievable. I asked for a different room but they said there was a water leak on like 20 floors so there was no availability. They should have given us a different room if the same type of room was unavailable. They charged us for the minibar with a bunch of drinks when we took nothing from it. Incredible! Also didn't apply the food credit to our restaurant bill.
30,Pool was beautiful rooms clean timeliness to check in not so great room we reserved wasn’t available upon checkin restaurants not kid friendly if check in was st three we didn’t get checked till four and they still wanted us ti wait possibly another hour for the room we reserved no thank you
10,Terrible experience due to check inn and did not receive my credit that manager was suppose to given of 200 dollars. I had to wait too long for my room to ready and everytime i went to the desk they told me it was not ready.
40,Staff was friendly but water was shut off at some point in the night and we had no hot water to shower in the morning. The pool area was a little overcrowded. The wave pool was 1 small wave every 5 minutes or so. The lazy river had floaties in it that kind of grossed me out. I gave 4 stars because I believe our negative experience wasn't the standard. The facility itself was overall gorgeous.
20,They make you check in at 3pm so you literally have 4 hrs of beach/ pool time at best. Who closes pool and main attraction beach pool at 7pm in the summer time? Also spent 20 min on the phone waiting for guest services to answer.
50,Good Food. Very pretty dealers many are  Ethiopian Eritrean (eg the Horn of Africa).  Enough about the dealers. Tournaments all  the time. In addition probably because of  competition all the Poker Rooms are better at  letting you text at the table (if you must)... Your  just can't do it while you are in a hand. Finally  they play 7 Card Stud there so you can have  fun and experiment with a new game.
20,20 min wait for elevator on day 1 our two rooms both had soaked carpets and no water for a day due to a leak. Our new rooms were dirty (one had only a used bar of soap and unflushed toilet!) spent several hours of our vacation to try and remedy zero consistency with customer service.
30,Many things could have been better. Food was bland in most restaurants. Ate at Citizens Noodle shop and slice of Vegas. Didn't enjoy the food at all. Upon arriving I was told easy check in at kiosk but was not warned about notifying I had a vehicle and needed parking voucher. I had to pay full price when leaving $18.00 a night. Yes that hurt a lot. The hotel said there was nothing they could do. Food by the pool was typically greasy fast food. Drinks expensive of course and the pool had mini waves nothing to rave about... kids were bored. Did I mention there was not water for 2 hours? Lastly when room was cleaned no fresh towels. I had to call to have the towels replaced...
10,The service was awful. I don’t recall ever having service this bad in the many many years we have been here. The amount of disrespect from several of the staff was completely uncalled for and unacceptable.
10,The hotel had a water issue in the room which they knew about but still put us in that room. The room was damp musty and had soaking wet floor throughout the room. The staff to resolve the problem by giving us free parking and a dinner. We should have went some where else.
40,Mandalay Bay is fun. It has some really great pools to enjoy. Get there early to score a lounge chair. Advise bringing your own inflatable inner tube/floaty to enjoy the river - otherwise pay $30. That's ok if you can take it home and enjoy it further. Staff is super friendly and accommodating.
50,Mandalay Bay has stepped up their game they’ve hired a lot more staff put more slot machines on the floor and a lot easier to get drinks while playing a nice rooms and great pool and plenty of restaurants to choose from.
50,It was our first time back to Vegas after four years and even do a lot have changed the experience was awesome Mandalay Bay rooms and pool are second to none and even do you can tell they are short staffed in some areas every thing for us was just perfect
30,I had built up the mandalay bay experience in my head that it was going to be luxurious and amazing and meh it was just ok. I wouldn’t pay premium dollar to stay there again. I’d much rather pay leads and stay on the strip
10,I would never stay here again and I had plans to ask my girlfriend to marry me but with everything that we went through it definitely wasn’t the right time because she was just tired of the whole experience and we just wanted the night mare to end so that’s all.
50,Good clean hotel. Check-in and out very easy and smooth. Also shout out to the elevator system. Was worried staying on the 57th floor that I would be spending lots of time on them but instead they worked very well.
40,The pools of course. Great restaurant options. Tram makes it okay to be at end of the strip. Our room had his and hers closets. Nice shower and separate tub. Staff was very nice. We will stay again…..
20,2 of the 4 days we stayed here had no running water or running water but no hot water. We should have to rush to take a shower or use the toilet before the water gets shut off again. Front desk manager was unhelpful when we asked to move to another wing or floor with running water and I was flat out told 'No'. The crowd they had was loud running up and down the hall all night. Marijuana smell was so strong in the hall way that it seeps into the room.
30,Didnt have room ready but they did make up for that. But we were on separate floors which was not supposed to happen! Has a lot of issues with going to other room to get shampoo because our key would not allow us to take the elevator to the room. Glad it was 2 room for only one night! We wanted our grandkids to enjoy the pool and lazy river so it cost us a lot and had issues getting seats in the shade without eating. Not like we remember
30,The room had a random loud banging that was coming from a vent in the bathroom. Some times it would last 15 minutes and sometimes an hour or more. Sounded like metal on metal banging. I tried calling downstairs but gave up after being on hold on their phone for 20 minutes. Also being charged more after prepaying and not for amenities but just things that just come with any normal room like wifi and i don't know what the rest was for. Though I didn't use the mini bar or fridge which would cost $50 to use a day if it's for your own drinks or food. They nickel and dime you to death it seems like to me.
50,"I'm not new to visiting Las Vegas. It a 4 hour drive from San Diego so I decided to take a ""girls trip"" with my 2 school aged daughters. The sole purpose of this trip was to take them to the Usher concert. I have to say as my first time staying at MB but NOT at a major hotel on the strip I was impressed.    Check-in was a breeze. Friendly staff who are knowledgeable and efficient. This matters when you've just arrived after a long travel time & are dying for a quick nap. In a sea of slot machines the elevators and ""tower"" were very easy to find.    The room: We stayed in their ""Stay Well"" room. Complete with an air purifier diffuser spa linens and water filter in the shower. We appreciated the cleanliness and absence of casino smoke in our room.    Hotel Restaurants: We experienced Lupo. The food was fresh & flavorful. The pastas are kid friendly as well. We dressed up & had reservations but there were plenty of ""casual"" people who were seated without a problem.    We ordered from Noodle Shop which was basic Chinese cuisine. We didn't really care for it.    We enjoyed breakfast at Seabreeze Cafe a couple times. Excellent service breakfast items and the portions were plentiful!    Pool: Definitely get there early. We were fortunate enough to have had a cabana so we enjoyed the pool area all day but saw people struggling with the lack of shade and hot Vegas sun. The water was cooler than I preferred but the hundreds of people in the water would say otherwise :) Plenty of lifeguards around for all those with littles.    Entertainment: Shark Reef was impressive and fun to walk through. Buy your tickets ahead of time and scan at the entrance. Super easy and it's about 1-1.5 hours to walk through. Michael Jackson ONE by Circ Du Soleil. All 3 of us were absolutely WOW'd by this show. The music the skill of the performers the tribute. All 100% worth seeing and totally family friendly.    Overall the Mandalay Bay exceeded my expectations in all aspects. The only suggestion to make would be to improve the air filtration on the Casino floor. The smell of smoke was pretty powerful but we hustled through just to get to fresher ground. LOL"
50,Best Resort on the strip…Rooms are amazing and always clean… pools are the best it like being at a water park and the Casino is the Best on the strip because it is spacious and clean and the employees are so friendly the drinks come quick and it doesn’t hurt the machines are always paying …I come once a month from Colorado and it’s always a great experience 😀
50,We've been here numerous times this one is one of our favorite Las Vegas hotels. Their rooms are always clean. Everybody is always so helpful valet and housekeeping are always pleasant and helpful!
50,pool area always clean friendly staff  few location for morning coffee & more. inside the hotel was cool and lean too. enough tables for playing cards . easy access to the playground and easy access to my room . i really like the food court there are variety of food and restaurants.
50,Mandalay Bay saved me from some of the mental anguish of not being treated very well by GM Grand after the MGM injured me. I can help the MGM properties and resorts make a lot of extra money with either a sports wagering website it even a movie about my life in the sports wagering industry of Las Vegas Thank You!
50,Everything was wonderful! The staff was helpful. The casinos were fun. And the bartenders were very attentive. We rented a cabana with no regrets and enjoyed all of the pools. Everything was very clean also. The room we stayed in was perfect.
50,Everything is clean and the room is very comfortable. The service is fast and the food is fresh. The staff treat you well and I definitely recommend this hotel to my friends. I enjoyed my stay. It's an incomparable experience that truly takes elegance to a new level.
10,Water went out 1 afternoon and the following 2 nights. Water leak caused power to go out in room amd staff was rude when we called to complain. Moble check in didn't work causing us to wait long time.
50,After waiting for more than 3 hours for our room we were upgraded to the best suite ever!!!  2 bedrooms 2 -1/2 baths a bar area and 2 living rooms. It was absolutely wonderful...  My husband didn't even want to leave the room-he enjoyed it that much!!1
50,Check in was easy room was upgraded to strip view room was clean comfortable. Loved hotel layout. Close access to pool area. Enjoyed the aquarium! Would definitely recommend staying here! We loved it and will return!
50,Came for a trade show. Staff was professional courteous and helpful. Room was spacious and well kept. Didn't have time to fully explore the recreational side of the hotel but what I saw made me feel like I'd never have to leave the resort should I return to Vegas again. Definitely recommend
50,Hotel stay was awesome! The hotel was very clean and smelled great. My only wish is to have the air conditioner work better and to have a fridge for our drinks. I would definitely stay at Mandalay Bay again!
50,I love your hotel the location the beach rooms were very clean the view I had strip view! Only thing I miss was the breakfast buffet! hotel it was truly amazing valet was very speedy bell guys were fast in getting our luggage up to room! Only hotel I will stay at when I visit Las Vegas again hopefully next year we can plan our family trip!
50,The pool was great my kids loved it !! Food at the hotel was good the room was spacious beds pretty comfortable we have a view to the pool which it was awesome for my kids ! I love the bathtub was really nice …
50,We had a great stay. The room was quite nice and very clean. This was our first time at Mandalay Bay and I’ll definitely be staying again. The amenities were plentiful with many dining choices. Parking was easy to get in/out of.
40,The property is beautiful and HUGE. Tons of dining options from casual eats to fine dining and food court. Casino is one of the best in Vegas easy to navigate spaced out and clean smelling. We used a lot of the amenities the property had to offer including many of the restaurants casino spa and pools. All were great spa was amazing! Location all the way on the south of the strip is a minor set back but they do have a free tram just an escalator ride from the casino floor and always have a long line of taxis outside so no waiting and all pretty cheap. Rooms were nice even basic rooms have a large bathroom and tub and the strip view is great too! They were having water issues during our stay but tried to do the shutoffs overnight to minimize effect on guests. The pool is one of the best in Vegas. Overall we had a great stay and will stay here again next time at Delano tower though!
10,Loved the room and the pool is legendary. But they made a mistake when I booked another night and they kept my security deposit. Called customer service and the first woman i spoke to was not helpful and was condescending. I asked for a manager and she said they can’t right now and would call me when available. Still haven’t heard from them
50,Great customer service and great hotel . Next visit hope it is the same experience. The rooms were great the casino was also super fun. Can’t wait until I visit again. Front desk and the cleaning crew was the best ever.
50,Great job wonderful stay good people good food. Had a really relaxing time. Got to see the strip from the last time about 10 years ago. Well worth the trip and a wonder pool to relax in even if it was a bit too crowded.  Thank you
20,We have stayed at Mandalay Bay multiple times and this was the first time we had a bad experience. We checked in around 11 am and asked to be placed near or side by side of our in laws for baby sitting purposes. Once our rooms were ready we were placed on separate floors. I spoke to the front desk and they placed on the same floor 6 rooms down (which was fine). However my in laws room was ready first and my room was going to be ready after it was cleaned. Now its about 12 pm when they informed me of my room being cleaned. 6 1/2 hours go by with no text or call that my room is ready so I call myself. I was told my room was ready for a while and they were not sure why I was not notified of it. I had to take my family of four which includes a 5 year old and 2 year old to stores so that they can stay cool while i was waiting for our room to be ready. I get to the hotel to get my room keys and head upstairs around 9 pm. We get to our room and the keys do not work. We kept trying to open the door using the keys given for about 15 minutes. We decide to head down again to get this fixed. It is now around 930 pm. We wait in line until we reach the front desk and they finally fix the situation. It is almost 10 pm and we are barely stepping foot in our hotel room. As you can see this is a huge inconvenience for a family that has children.
10,OK. Sometimes people bleed. It is what it is. But when this blood is left as a stain on washed sheets complained about three times and never changed during a three day stay that’s unacceptable. The bills are incredibly convoluted. If you lift up a beverage from the refrigerator to look at it you are charged. Pressure sensors in the refrigerator. Good grief.
50,Mandalay Bay is my go-to resort when I go to Las Vegas! Beautiful well-appointed rooms a fabulous spa and a super great casino. Slept late every day ate at the fantastic Stripsteak restaurant and had a very much deserved massage at their awesome spa! Oh and the casino! Huge - and loose slots!
50,It was great ! the beach is my grand kids favorite they also loved the lazy river. every one was very attentive the shark 🦈 reef was also great the kids loved it we will be back before the summer is over
30,We turned down the thermostat to 65 and the room didn’t cool off. They said that’s how it is. 🙄 if you want a float tube for lazy river buy one before you get there. $30 for a tube is too much and you can’t use it anywhere else.
50,If you don't mind hot sand the pool area at Mandalay Bay is the best. Great lazy river and wave pool. The Cabanas around the lazy river are the best if you're treating yourself! All staff throughout the resort are friendly and helpful.
50,Had a great time. The rooms were very nice. Plenty of good gambling options. The grandkids loved the pool area. The Seabreeze Cafe has a really good breakfast. Also had a good meal at House of Blues.
50,It was wonderful place to relax and enjoyed our time  Every thing was clean and ready  They guide us a lot to get the tour to Grand Canyon  We had wonderful time in there  We are planning to go there one more time this year  Thank you
50,Great rooms clean and comfortable. Plenty of slots and tables. The air is clean and cool. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. plenty of restrooms and great restaurants. Plenty of ATM’s and cashiers. I recommend this Hotel and casino will definitely come back.
50,My daughter her fiancé and myself celebrating her birthday. We love the room. The room is so luxury and beautiful. Services was great and the staff are so helpful and friendly. We will return to Vegas and stay at Mandalay Bay.
40,I enjoyed myself along with the family but I noticed a change in security( not much of it) and noticed some tolerance issues with a couple of your employees. Never experienced that at all in Vegas. Also there are people walking the floor looking for something to take. No idea what that is. Had to keep my eye on them
50,Beautiful hotel! Loved the room. It’s spacious with two nice size closets and a big bathroom. A good selection of restaurants and beautiful pool area. The aquarium was fun to visit as well. We loved the mall  Area and being attached to Luxor.
50,I arrived from California after being mugged i had no credit card only a little cash and had to still make it back to Colorado driving (gas prices) well from the front desk to M life rewards everyone was absolutely amazing even though they did not have to believe me truly amazing
50,Excellent VIP hotel experience. Everything I requested was provided for. We had two rooms (Two bedroom suite/regular king room) . We got the view we wanted and the same floor close together. Valet was smooth bellman was friendly and patient rooms were clean and up to par. The VIP lounge was very useful and helpful. Bypassing all the front desk. Penthouse VIP lounge access was even better. Well worth it for anyone who can add those services on.
50,Fun  Relaxing  No issues    Clean  Clean rooms    Beds were comfortable    Room was quiet    I would take family again ….    Easy access to the property    Plenty of stores and food vendors to choose from within the property. No need to leave property
50,Excellent in all aspects from the rooms restaurants bars and casino gaming. The pools were outstanding with many to choose from including a lazy River. It was a little challenging to get bar service while at the wave pool due to not enough servers.
50,Room was clean and very comfortable. Room service was fast and friendly. View was great. Family friendly help in all areas of hotel accommodations relax atmosphere no problems at all. From check in to check out
10,We were very disappointed with the service. It was my wife’s birthday and our stay at Mandalay Bay was something we hope never experience again. Our room wasn’t serviced until 11pm. On my wife’s birthday there was no running water. Things just got worst for us there
30,Beds were very uncomfortable like sleeping on a banana got horrible sleep walls must be thin heard my neighbors talking thru closed doors went there for the pool and the pool was awesome everything else was great except the rooms
50,We had a wonderful time celebrating our anniversary. We got married on the beach at Mandalay Bay and this trip was exceptional. The S Bar Eyecandy Libertine Social and Kumi…..they are all incredible places to eat and drink.
10,After waiting a half hour in line to speak to the front desk agent we were told that our rooms were not ready. We showed up 2 hours after the check in time and our room was not available. We were traveling with another family and their room was not ready either.    We requested to have adjoining rooms but the front desk agent said that it was not possible. The agent got us pre-checked in but did not give us an approximate time of when the rooms would be available.    While waiting for our rooms to be ready an agent from the Delano called the family that we were traveling with to let them know that they could offer an upgraded room to them. The other family told the agent on the line that they need 2 rooms since there were 2 families traveling together and 2 rooms were originally booked at the Mandalay Bay hotel. The agent on the line said that they did not have any adjoining rooms either and could not get two two rooms close to each other on the same floor. Additionally they said they only had king rooms available when both family's reservations were for two queen beds. Since the king beds did not meet our reservation needs I don't know why the Delano agent even called us since they were unable to help us.    After waiting another 30 minutes the family that we were traveling with was notified by text message that the room was available but it took another 15 minutes of waiting in line at mobile check in just to get a key.    I never received a text message confirmation saying that my room was ready even though I did confirm with the front desk agent that pre-checked us in that the phone number they had was correct. I waited for 3 hours after the pre-check and did not get any confirmation so I went back through the font desk and spent another 20 minutes waiting to speak to an agent. When I finally met with an agent I told them that I had been pre-checked in for the past 3 hours but was not notified about my room being ready. The agent hastily checked the computer and rudely told us that the room was ready and handed me a set of keys. When I asked why I was not notified they agent bluntly said I don't know but your room is available now and the elevators are back there and to the left. I left the front desk very upset with the kind of customer service that we had received after having been at the hotel for nearly 5 hours already and not having a room.
20,Traumatic experience when the water main line broke right outside our room . Scalding water filled the room where we were trapped on the bed for 30 minutes while they turned the water off and got us out. Wasn’t able to get my money back since I booked “third party”
30,There was a very strange smell coming from the bedsheets that was noticeable almost immediately upon laying down. One morning I had to wake up and immediately toss the pillow far away from me because the smell. We used a stuff animal as a pillow then I realized the smell was starting to pass on to the stuffed animal from the bed.  The next night I decide to sleep with my arms over the pillow and I woke up with rashes in my armpits.  Also there were no trash bags in any of the trash containers in the room or bathroom. The trash can in the room could have been wiped down and cleaned better as there were multiple stains on the leather. Seemed like someone threw up around the trash can or it was some other type of bodily fluid spewed on there.    Parking sucks because you gotta walk past the restaurants then across the entire casino to get to the elevators to your room.
50,Trip was made for simple reasoning of wanting to enjoy the Mandalay Pools and Lazy River. We love MGM Resorts in Vegas and spend all our vacations there. Will definitely be back to either Mandalay Bay or MGM as they both have lazy rivers
30,I went to take take a shower upon leaving my last day. I happend to spot which looks like mold growth on top off shower. Very unprofessional cleaning . I also felt disgusted knowing I took previous showers in there. There was hair all long the outside bed in the bed frame. I felt disgusted after seeing all that upon my departure knowing i was sleeping with that felth around
10,Checked in and paid at 3:30..room ready at 5:30. Some sort of glitch they said. Several families and couples are standing here waiting. Many many people after us checked in and got rooms. Staff huddled then disappeared in back for almost 2 hours. Just give everyone another room. It’s not that hard. No apologies no have a drink in the bar no have dinner on us just people checking in in droves and a fairly large group just standing there waiting and wondering why we chose this place. Eventually get a room. AC doesn’t work well at all. Finally got it to drop below 80. Room is set up weird. Bathroom is behind or beside one of the beds? Strange and a tight fit to use. Now at 3:30 in the morning the water somehow doesn’t work. Stool doesn’t flush no shower etc. good grief for what we pay just in resort fees you would think the toilet would flush. We are checking out in just a bit and are never staying here again.  Try Excalibur at least I expect these issues from them.  Does no good to reply all you will say is sorry and you will speak to whatever appropriate department and hope we will try your resort again. Same ol song and dance when you could have practiced a little customer service at the beginning
30,Not the best but not the worst either. Great hotel for families. Our room was not very clean upon arrival. The hotel took care of it but still it was gross. I absolutely despise the location. I would have much rather stayed at Mirage or even Treasure Island to be in the middle of the strip near everything. We had to Uber everywhere which was annoying. The pool is nice but overrated in my opinion.
40,Overall Mandalay Bay has impressed me by making improvements to the property with restaurants and upgrade to the rooms. I thought the rooms are nicely decorated and clean. The pool has always been an attraction and I took full advantage of it when I visited the resort.
10,Paid for resort view room given a roof-top and parking structure view room. The staff did not bother with fixing the issue nor did they attempt to compensate for it. In the end they wanted to charge us for moving a coffee cup in the room because it has sensors and that we had moved the cup around to make room on the table!!!
30,room can be better. Smelly towels broken shower faucet no free coffee provided in the room. Didn’t even use refreshment they charged room had to call front desk to cancel. Only like there beach and pool.
50,WONDERFUL ANNUAL SUMMER STAYCATION WITH MY GRANDDAUGHTER!!!! We enjoyed the beach pool and several different Restaurants Fleur Stripsteak Johnny Rockets and Room Service. We went to Americas Got Talent (Loved it!!!) MYSTERE  O CIRQUE DE SOLOEL ( Both Amazing!!!) All in all we had a great time!!! Just be ready to spend a grip of money! Be sure to go over your final bill with a fine tooth com just to be sure your not charged for things you already paid for!!!
10,I recently stayed at Mandalay Bay and this was my family first time staying there because we heard a lot of good things about the fun wave pool. One of my child was too young to enjoy the wave pool anyways. My experience at this hotel was not great at all. The hotel is alright so not most comfiest but I can still live with it. We experienced no running water in this hotel for 3 days for a good 4-5 hours. When we called the guest service we were told many lies. I spoke to a guy and he said the entire hotel doesn’t have running water but little did he know J travelled with a few family members that were also staying in this hotel. Apparently our side our floor was the only without running water. I was lucky enough to shower at my sister hotel because she was in the same hotel but in a different floor. This was after we swam at the salt water pool and imagine no running water. Anyways I will stick with another hotel next time.
10,On top of the resort fees they charge you for each chair at the pool if you want to sit near an umbrella and you have to pay for the umbrella too. Poor customer service everything took way too long not what it used to be. Sad but true. Will probably never go back.
20,The water was shut off in our room for over 12 hours at two different times. We could not use the bathroom sinks or shower during this time. That really ruins your vacation. We heard from our cab driver that this is a common problem. I used to love Mandalay Bay but next time we will be staying somewhere else.
40,The hotel is great. The room is spacious and clean. There are 4 excellent swimming pools. But there is no buffet in the hotels. We had to go to a nearby hotel in a buffet. The hotel is at the beginning of the street.
50,Although it’s away from the center of everything on the strip I appreciate the location since we’re still in a pandemic. There were less crowds. lol like that there were vegan options at some of the restaurants. And of course the room was clean and roomy. Will definitely visit again.
20,Mandalay called me before I arrive saying I got a complementary upgrade to my room. When I went to check in I I spent 30 minutes waiting for the concierge‘s to help me and then ended up paying double what I was supposed to pay initially before the upgrade. I am upset and I do not recommend this resort anymore.
50,We had family and friends joining us from different parts of the country to celebrate our daughters 21st birthday. The staff and resort were amazing in helping make her feel special and accommodating to our parties. What a great trip to Mandalay Bay-will definitely stay again!
50,The check-in staff was fast and efficient. The room was clean and the bar stocked. We had a lot of fun and felt safe at this venue. The pool area was also clean and the staff was very friendly. We are planning a second trip this year and we will definitly choose MGM.
40,our family stayed at mandalay bay during a wedding trip to red rock valley of fire.the hotel was clean and had everything you needed there would be no reason to leave the property. the pool area was very nice and perfect for people traveling with children it wasnt a party pool! it is on the end of the strip so thats something to consider if u want to be center strip! we road the free tram service several times and walked to center strip.I would recomend the burger bar in hotel if you are looking for a quick dinner.
10,Queues were far too long for all breakfast places hazels was way too expensive and line way too long Starbucks was way too long to wait as well was about 30 minutes and not good or possible if u have to leave early in the morning to catch a flight or travel  they need something quicker and better or improve queues as not good at all for people who need to get going quick in the morning for flights travel changeovers or other purposes.
50,I stay at Mandalay Bay as much as possible. Great options within the casino with food activities connection shops to Luxor that allows the ability to stay in one spot. The pools are always a reason I stay here during pool season!!!!
40,We stayed 10 years ago in the Four Seasons hotel which is the top few floors of this building so weren’t sure how Mandalay Bay rooms would compare. But after a slightly painful queue to check in we weren’t disappointed as the room was great - good size clean and beautifully appointed. Strip view well worth the extra spend.    This hotel is a great choice for those of us with kids being at far end of The Strip so good to retreat to after a busy day. Large pool areas are busy but again great with kids. The tram via Luxor and Excalibur wasn’t there last time we visited and is also a helpful addition.    It’s a huge complex and all feels quality fab selection of restaurants and even smells nice everywhere! Buffet was closed during our stay which was a shame but plenty of other excellent (better) options anyway.    Only gripes are similar to what I’ve seen in other reviews. One is please change the shampoo in the room it’s like washing hair with dish soap. But main problem is feeling like you’re been taken for cash at every single turn. Expensive mini bars are expected but 22 bucks for water or 50 bucks to store your own in the fridge!? And they even took the free coffee in the room which they also now charge for. These are reasons I can’t give five stars.    With all that said overall good experience and we’d very likely stay here again next time we visit Vegas.
20,First of all want to say I understand things happen. A pipe burst during our stay and flooded our room. However they moved us to another wing where the water was shut off due to more flooding. We did get vouchers and hotel resort fee waived. The reason for low rating is the night manager at front desk was not professional. He told us he reads reviews so I’m sure he will see this. So who knows if he will change. Also if you stay here make sure you book through hotel and not third party so in case this happens to you can get your money back for hotel room.
50,Enjoyed the the whole stay rooms took Tram to Luxor. Was very disappointed that the buffet was closed for good really enjoyed it in the past. Grandgirls enjoyed the pool and lazy river in the real beach like pool.
10,The water was shut off in our tower due to a leak and although I understand things happen we were not informed the water would be shut off. I found out when I had a non working toilet faucet or shower. Then my son was looking on the dresser drawers when we checked into our room and we found old food clearly housekeeping didn’t check all the drawers when that room was cleaned.
40,The shampo soup and conditioner really need to be changed and use a better quality. It is a very poor quality. The towels can be updated as well. Wait time on the phone to talk to front desk or guest service was very lengthy.
30,Get gouged at every turn. $18 to park (day) $50 to use the fridge overpriced food overpriced casino gaming. Pool was nice but extremely crowded. Guest jammed together. Difficult to find a lounge chair because guest would abandon their towels and you couldn't tell if they were still in use. Or a guest would come place a couple tshirt on lounge chairs in the morning and then MAYBE show up hours later or not at all. Good strategy if you want to be a jerk.
20,This has become one of the cheaper hotels on the strip and it shows. Great layout inside everything clean but rooms are hot and couldn’t get our room until 9:30. Pools are overcrowded and if your in town while a large conference is in town good luck using the elevators. Location is good in my opinion but hotel has gone downhill since the shootings years ago. Toilet and sink had issues super hot in the room for the entire 4 days which is sad because we’ve stayed at mandalay for years and the restaurants are great the layout is great the Sportsbook and poker room are great but the rooms and pool are subpar now to Vegas standards.
50,Great stay overall. The casino was great connection to the mall was neat and the pools were clean and wonderful. Parking was tricky but easy once I found out how to get there. If I go back I will be staying there again.
50,Haven't stayed at Mandalay Bay in a few years. But was really glad I came back. The service was amazing the property was large and very clean. The selection of restaurants & the restaurant staff at the restaurants were all stellar.
30,Beautiful property but it’s huge and too many fees. Not allowed to use fridge in room without a fee. The beach and pool area was very nice but very busy with fees attached to everything. If your interested in staying on site it’s great but it’s far from middle of strip
50,We did our whole check in process on the app. When our room was ready it showed right on the app. It was awesome we went straight to our room when we got there. It was super nice not to have to wait in line. The pools there are amazing as well. Loved the lazy river.
30,Clean friendly staff. Not too crowded except at beach. Beds are comfortable and rooms decent size for value. Quiet rooms. Food options are mixed - didn’t try all of them but felt that Chinese was definitely not completely authentic and could do a lot better. Not all trams running. Restaurants didn’t seem to be that busy but Starbucks was out of 1/2 their items.
50,We loved our stay at Mandalay Bay and can’t wait to go back. We stayed in the Moorea Suite amazing room with in incredible view. We visited the Shark Reef Aquarium while there super cute and not too pricey. The pool was great not too crowded and the staff was so kind. Will definitely be back
10,I look forward to Mandalay Bay (formerly referred to by my group since 1999 as TGBOTP - “the greatest building on the planet”) for the wonderful amenities such as the Spa. With no advance notice the spa was closed and I wasn’t even able to book a massage with my all time favorite masseuse. The restaurant that used to be “THE CAFE” on the Delano side always had heated plates fresh squeezed OJ and fresh farm toast for breakfast now none of that and the bacon was pathetic. My room wasn’t serviced on one of my nights and I called late afternoon to have it serviced but was told that housekeeping was gone for the day. Seriously … is this a 30 room motel or a massive resort? To not have the ability to make a room late afternoon is inexcusable. I have tried to sway my friends who used to stay at MB to come back but they have all moved on and now stay/gamble at Paris/Caesar’s. From now on I will join them. What a shame it has come to this after so much money being spent on updating the rooms etc.
50,Our favorite one stop shop for the Vegas luxury experience. From the food and restaurants to the day spa and pools Mandalay has something for everyone. We always stay here anytime we come for a quick stay in Vegas.
30,This was my first time staying here and will definitely be my last! I’m an MGM reward member so when I visit Vegas I try to stay at an MGM resort. This is one of the resorts I can not understand why the service was the way it was! It’s beautiful on the inside and the pool is really nice but the service makes you forget about it all! They limit you on towels and when you contact housekeeping for extras they make you feel like your bothering them! I get it that they may be saving water but it’s hot and no one wants to be going out to the restaurant’s or shows all sweaty! Also the television never went off! Even when pressing the power button on television and remote! All around a weird and uncomfortable stay!
40,We stayed at the Mandalay Bay to celebrate a 21st birthday. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room could have been a little cleaner but was nice. Loved the total atmosphere and the way things were laid out.
50,Great staff and love the restaurants! Always a breeze when we stay here! Check in is easy & don’t have to go anywhere else on strip. This is your one stop shop. We never go anywhere else when we come to Vegas
30,The coupon I tried applying never worked. I used the MyVEGAS rewards and it still didn’t work. The bed left my back hurting. Water pressure in the shower was too low. At one point they turned off the water.
50,This hotel was our go to place during the Pandemic. Large modern rooms at a reasonable price awesome pools with a sand beach excellent casino and a variety of fine restaurants and bars. Easy check in and check out with an easy access parking garage.
50,The Mandalay Bay is a great property with activities for all ages. From the amazing wave pool to the more adult pool at the Moorea Beach Club the Mandalay Bay does a great job of having everything you need in one place. It is well situated on the strip as well having access to the cluster of properties nearby (Excaliber New York New York MGM Grand etc) and some unique shopping places such as the M&M store and the Coke Store. Further down the strip near the Wynn is the other place to be on the strip as you have the fashion mall nearby and the Forum shops at Caesars. The casino floor is quite chill. In the attached mall you can dine at some fantastic restaurants as well. Kumi Japanese food is one of my favourites. BTW I rated the value as Very Good but you have to understand that that is Very Good value for Las Vegas. A beer will cost you $12 at the bar but that said the free drinks at the slot machines and table games were rolling quickly all night.
30,The room thermostat said 65 but it was more like 75. The hallway were more like 80 not 72. The casino was nice and cool. Also the bathrooms had no vents or AC. The property was beautiful and my boys loved the beach and wave pool.
50,great the best fun awsome exciting over whelming expereance the most fun the best time with familly can’t wait to come back for the most fun i ever had the sights to see the most fun the familly said it was the best time ever
50,Clean easy to navigate friendly staff and good food selection. Citizens is an excellent food choice for any time of day. Food was very good and not too expensive. We all loved it. the French dip and the BLTA were the family favorite.
10,If I could give any advice it’s stay away from Mandalay Bay. Spend more money and stay further down the strip for a hotel that treats customers better and gives them functional rooms with better customer service.
10,The room was a mess there were virtually no windows (so it was dark) I got up-charged for it too. Staff not super helpful and food was not up to par. Whatever type of trip I take I would always hope for better than I received here.
50,Couples trip very happy with the experience checkin process is excellent contactless I believe is the best way to go to continue to be safe . Very clean casino staff was extremely friendly and helpful when needed
30,Mandalay offers the best swimming pools however their Rewards Points acceptance from Starlight Tattoo has been removed. Standing in line for an hour to add points is a waste of time. Their rooms need to be more upkeep but the beds were super comfortable.
40,"As I mentioned on previous screen.  It was very unpleasant/cheap/unprofessional/ (running out of words to describe) experience. While spending hours and lots of money in Casino Restaurants shops and ... charging extra for ""removing"" items from the fridge it's just disrespectful. As front desk mentioned there is a note in the room for using fridge and rules and blah blah blah but that doesn't change the fact that this is just entrapment for ""Guests"" to fall into extra unnecessary charges."
30,No one took full responsibility for the incident that took place with my Husband. Most everyones responses the same. Not my problem please contact this person. Which left a very bad taste in my mouth. We spent the entire time there with me at the pool and my husband in the room do to the pains he was having in his neck due to the slip and fall at the ice maker!!
50,Mandalay has it all! Great rooms pools day and night life amazing restaurants shopping and gambling fun! We did a 2 night stay at the resort. This resort has a lot to offer and you will have a great time.
50,Large room comfy beds large room with instant hot water. Best pools in Vegas. We will be back. The only negative was that in the room you cannot put anything in the fridge or you will be charged. There should be some space to put a leftover or personal item in the fridge.
20,Overpriced for everything not worth the money spent $2100 for a week stay no cups provided ($9) service charge for a $1 cup club music heard clearly in room didn’t sleep good hot water went in/out air coming out pipes key card stopped working several times
50,Always clean and beautiful welcoming and accommodating staff fun music and dancing and hands down the BEST pool in Vegas. The Border Grille was also right up there with the best meals I’ve ever been served. As if it all wasn’t perfect enough we saw Michael Jackson One during which I laughed danced in my seat sang along felt amazed and even cried. Just a breathtaking experience. I highly recommend to everyone
50,Mandalay Bay is the casino at the end of the strip but it has the amenities to let you relax or party. Lots of restaurant choices as well as an active night life with live music. Great pool area with choices for adults and kids. The Tram helps to get you down the strip to enjoy even more of the LV action.
50,The Mandalay Bay is a beautiful resort with many amenities. The hotel and casino are very clean. The resort has a lovely pool area. The staff here is excellent. There are many restaurant options available. It is located on the quieter South end of the strip.
10,They forgot to give us our 3 rooms and forgot to give us the same floor as we requested and the worst of all the did nothing about it   Have I not ckd on the rooms after 5 hours of waiting for them they wouldn’t have contacted me to let me know there ready!!! The ck in clerk was very rud unprofessional and didn’t know what she was doing.
10,I was given a special price online and thru the bookong process when final email was sent only 1 room was a the promised discount price No one at the reasort cared or tried to help the manager did not even bother to explain he jist told the front desk lady there was nothing they coild do
50,Great place for families lots of restaurant choices local tram spacious and never felt crowded even though it was busy. Staff were very friendly. Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. We stayed in Staywell it was worth the money for the upgrade.
50,We really enjoyed our stay at the resort! Didn’t actually use the casino. Loved the variety of kid friendly activities restaurants + shops in walking distance. Pools were awesome! A bit shocked by some prices but overall very happy!
40,Love the view and pools.. casino was clean and elegant as well as the restaurants and restrooms . Parking lot was big and so much space .. I did have trouble looking for things because how big the hotel is but it was great
10,Tv cable not working half of my stay. Room was not cleaned at all by crew. Room was set to 67 but is not getting cold. Constantly at 75. Only few elevators working for some floors. The only good thing is the pool for kids.
30,Pool area was great but the room was disappointing stained furniture low quality bedding AC unable to keep the room cool and staff is not helpful. The tram doesn’t open early enough requiring walking yo Luxor and Excalibur. Next time I would choose a property more centrally located in the middle of the strip.
40,We had a great stay except our connected room had their tv blasting all night. It was not the original room room we reserved but was ready at 5:00pm when we arrived so we took it. It was 2 queen instead of 1 king. We could hear them room next store the entire time in our room along with their blasting tv all night. Told front desk but it was brushed over. Otherwise loved the hotel.
20,Back in the day off you gambled $10000 or more in a weekend you were considered a good customer and most of your expenses would be comped from your bill. Now management has gotten so cheap they literally give you no incentive to gamble there. Go to another non MGM property and they'll take care of you better I assume
40,We visited the aquarium during our stay in vegas (we didn’t stay at the Mandalay) but the aquarium was nice. $29 pp and without kids it takes less than an hour to go round. There are plenty of fish and lots of sealife to look at here. We had photos taken which was nice and seemed good value for money.
10,We had fees $40 per day added onto our initial agreed upon room rental AFTER checking in which is absolutely wrong. The pools were extremely busy. The minimums on table bets was $25.00 which is ridiculous.
30,I was very unhappy with the status of the refrigerator we could not keep our personal items cold because of the fully liquor stock refrigerator with a $50 warning if you move any items you will be charged so I had to throw away all my personal items which are special diet for me
50,Nice property casino is spacious and wide open easy to navigate. Good variety of restaurants. Rooms are clean and nice. Big outdoor pool area with several pool options. Good variety of entertainment in the evening. Amazing views from the Foundation room outdoor patio.
50,I love this hotel and the view of the strip and the polls. And the cleaning nest of the rooms and that thru are not destroy and they are like new. And the people help you if you need help and they are nice.
50,Everything is good. If we could store stuff in the refrigerator without getting a fee it would be good. If there was drinkable hot water if would be even better. If they added microwaves in the rooms it would be excellent. Overall a great resort and casino. I rate it an 8/10.
50,Clean and friendly great for teens and younger children safe and very well staffed great lifeguards very strict that's always a good thing I would only have liked that they did not re rent my beach chair to someone else because they think I left for the day so they re sell chairs and cabanas to numerous people in one day this is the only problem
50,We were in Vegas for our daughter's wedding. She had rented a house for most of the time but we needed one night at a hotel before flying out. We chose Mandalay Bay due to it's proximity to the airport and the pool area. The grandkids absolutely loved the lazy river and pool area. All of the employees we encountered during our stay were super friendly and helpful. They made us feel very welcome.
30,Had a great time. Wonderful experience. A little far from the rest of the strip. Also had a little mix up with billing after I left but still waiting to get that resolved. But mgm is great. Not worried
40,The room and the hotel were clean. I was surprised how comfortable the bed and pillows were. The casino was less chaotic than the others in a good way. Great for families. We loved the wave pool and lazy river. There was a lack of varied food options. I would stay again in a heartbeat.
20,Long lines to check-in rooms often not ready on time (i.e. after 3 pm as advertised) Staff constantly trying to push services and products. Room was clean but there are no basic amenities like refrigerator (there is one in the room but it is essentially trip wired as a vending machine and not accessible for customer use)
20,Didn’t clean the room for 2 days I asked for clean sheets and I didn’t get them I also asked if I can change rooms and they told me that I can’t! I go there every year for the past 5 years and I never had a problem before!
50,I don’t usually leave a review but this was by far the best hotel we’ve stayed at.  We had a night flight so we def needed a good night sleep and we got it! The pillows and bed were sooo comfy.  The selection of pools was just amazing for all of our girls and the drinks were yummy for the adults  Staff was incredible and helpful  Restaurants were delish  Casino didn’t have a strong cigarette smell now that I think back which is amazing  Overall a beautiful hotel and we will definitely be back!
50,This resort is beautiful!! The room was clean and nice bathtub was exactly what was needed for long overdue relaxation. Wish I could've taken the pillows and bed home! Love this place and we can't wait to come back!!!
50,Never have I seen so many happy children enjoying many of the water event from the wave to the not so lazy river. To the Jacuzzis and very convenient from your room straight to the pool area from the elevator
20,Wish I would have went to the MGM it was closer to all the food places and the shopping and the shows this just wasn’t a family friendly hotel to noisy put us right by the air port so it was always loud and it seems they just trying to make money off u I did not like it had a lot of pools I’ll give it that
30,Great hotel…management customer service could use some extra customer service training.    Overall great location…great pools…nice rooms and the restaurants onsite have awesome food. Slot machines could pay out more often🤣
50,Great clean room friendly-sweet employees in all areas lots to do from shark viewing to ice bar. very enjoyable stay with lots of shopping and easily accessible Tram transportation to get places. Would recommend
50,Check in was easy the room was wonderful and quiet! The bed was the best!!! I’ve stayed at other hotels in the area and by far this is my favorite❤️ I would definitely stay here again. The room service was also very quick.
30,As with all the other hotels in Vegas the fees charged on top of the price of the room are out of control. We paid almost 50% of the price of the room in fees. The pool area is great for the kids. The price of alcoholic drinks is high.
40,View was awesome. Beds a little hard for my taste. The staff was great. Restaurants were good but pricey. They do have a food court with a 24 hr Subway Johnny Rockets but you have to walk a mile to get to it.
50,Mandalay never disappoints me. Friendly staff comfortable rooms great atmosphere and the best pool in Las Vegas. It’s location is ideal being away from all of the hubbub of the Strip but convenient to it by Tram.
50,Finally had a vacation relaxing not just running around.  Would like to come back annually for just rest & recreation and pampering.  I would like the treat of the services and restaurants offered at site.
50,Great stay we really love the stay at mandala bay! Unfortunately it is a long walk from the reminder of the strip. But otherwise the property was fantastic and great pool! Much needed and much appreciated
30,Rooms were older and not the cleanest  Housekeeping only happened sporadically  The pools are nice and refreshing  The in room snacks and the store are really expensive (like $20 for a bottle of water??) … restaurants are ok… it’s average for the price - expected more but it wasn’t terrible - it’s was ok
10,First day we were evacuated from pool immediately    Kids were pushed and half of our belongings were left behind  Staff didn’t let us go back for it.    Second day same exact thing happened but this time is we made sure we didn’t buy anything here.
10,Staff all around were rude and acted like they were too busy to help a party of four. Drinks in the casino we’re being up charged. The Wi-Fi doesn’t work which requires you to get a “real” room key. I personally will never stay with Mandalay Bay again.
50,Kid friendly hotel that me and the family enjoyed. The kids loved the shark aquarium and the food at the border grille. How can I not forget the pool for the kids (last river) was the highlight for the kids
20,We will never book at this resort again.. we were forced to wait until 7:30 pm for our room. Meanwhile everyone else is getting room keys.  House keeping only came once during our stay.  The only good thing is the pool.
30,"Great staff and decent casino and rooms. My gripe and its a biggie...the wave pool has ""waves"" every 90 seconds. These waves are literally ripples in the water. A joke of a wave pool. And the lazy river small as hell."
50,We were there initially for business then extended it to a family vacation. The food and everything was amazing! Our kids loved all the different food options and we didn’t plan on going to the pool but we made our way to it and it was so much fun.
40,The staff is friendly and the hotel is clean. My only complaint is that the hotel was very crowded. I came with several members of my family and the due to the hotel being so crowded they were not able to accommodate us all all on the same floor. We all ended up on different floors making it very difficult to spend time with each other in our rooms. Because you need a key card to use in the elevator get to each other‘s room.
30,The hotel rooms themselves were excellent service and staff very nice but parking was horrible. You had to self-park or valet park but the road signs that led to self-park were not very clear. We finally found the parking structure took our luggage to the elevator and had to wait a while because it was packed. It was over 100 degrees inside the parking structure so while waiting we were sweating and very uncomfortable. Then we had to go down the elevator and entered the lobby area with a parking ticket machines greeting us and we didn't know what to do with that. We went through the smokey casino (10 minutes walk with 4 kids) and finally arrived at the front desk. There was a long line which was not so bad because it moved pretty quickly but the whole process of going from parking to the front desk was a bit of a hassle. They charge $18 per parking which is another hidden cost. However the rooms are nice and clean though I thought overpriced. When checking out it is a good idea to ask them to print out the receipt and see what they charge you because they charged me $12 per coffee in the room which I did not even drink! Also we cannot open the fridge because we were told there is a sensor which would automatically charge you a fee thinking you took their water. Make sure you look at the receipt carefully for things like that.
10,Shall I start at being kidnapped from  the taxi valet area. Management creating rules over the phoneHousekeeping going through your things.😡 Management never returning your calls. 7th and last visit.
40,Great atmosphere clean rooms. The rooms are super nice the hitel is really clean. We are always eager to stay here. Service is great just experienced not so great service on the casino floor. The wait staff on the floor can be rude.
50,Mandalay Bay still offers the best experience on the strip. The hotel and casino continue to remain in outstanding condition. The service is excellent and the staff friendly. Mandalay is always my choice when in Vegas
30,I gotta say I’ve always loved MGM and Mandalay Bay but this go around was the worst. For the amount you pay for this room it is not worth it. They really need to switch the two TVs in each bedroom with the big TVs in the living room. It was a very bare plain room. Great view but just horrible. I stayed at the large suit at the mirage for the same price and it blew Mandalay Bay out of the water. They had the big screen tv that rises from the foot of your bed and you had to beds in one of the bedrooms. With a living room and a pull out. The whole layout was better then Mandalay Bay’s. Might wanna ask your buddies over there what you should do with your two bedrooms. Also the button on the elevator on the 29th floor was pushed all the way in the hole you could use it.
30,The overall visual of the hotel was nice; however staff was did not present a willingness to help. The room was filthy and not cool the room was warm. I am sure the suites are nice and if you have money you will be treated well.
50,I stayed in the 2 bedroom panoramic. Absolutely amazing room and view. Plenty of space. Would definitely recommend for large families. 2 bathrooms with showers came in extremely helpful when getting ready.
10,The desk staff tried to cheat on me. I asked the balance of my hotel credit(by Amex credit card benefit) But the staff kept telling me I spent all. I asked the evidence as I spent only half of the hotel credit. (I had the receipt-evidence then) The staff kept telling me a lie that he can't see any details but for sure I spent all of my credit. I showed my receipt to him but he didn't care at all. I called a manager then he told me that I have the balance of hotel credit. Crazy customer service. Very unkind and rude desk staff.
40,Good service amazing pool and we like the tram. Check in line moved very fast and was very informative. Casino and hotel are kept up very nicely. Casino restrooms are clean which is pretty unusual. House of blues food was on point.
30,"This resort could have been a lot nicer. I was here on a business trip and had not chosen to come here. The rooms were warm no way was it the 65 degrees the thermomast stated it was and some smelled. I had mulitple coworkers have the exact same problems. Areas by the pool and ride share smelled like sewage. The elevator card system did not always work I ran across many people who were ""stuck"" in the elevator until they could find someone who was on the same floor as them. The food was mediocre and for the price of everything the least they can allow is for you to use your mini fridge to keep things cool."
10,The pool was horribly crowded. We couldn't get a lounge chair either of the two days we visited the pool.  In-room coffee costs $12/cup and there's no sign indicating such. To top it off the coffee was horrible.
10,Horrible service from front desk and they are no help at all! The room wasn't even ready even though they said it was. They don't help resolve anything and just make you wait while they act like they're trying to help.
20,The room I originally checked into head out and I cleaned nor the trash taken out. The view was obscured by a wall and I had to call down and be relocated. The neighbors are joining me had children being on the door and screaming at all hours and the new room was half the size of the original that I checked into. The second room I ended up next to noisy neighbors next-door and across the hall my virtual key did not work at all and I ended up going down to the front desk to get a physical key which only worked intermittently. On my last day there there was a cockroach in the bathroom when I went to take a shower. I am a pearl status member and my parking should’ve been validated but my reward card did not work in any of the machines or at the parking validation kiosk. I ended up paying for parking and then going to the rewards desk and asking to be reimbursed which they could not do. Instead I was issued a food voucher. I had heard many great things about Mandalay Bay but my stay was absolutely disappointing and frustrating. I will say all of the staff that I encountered throughout all of the issues were very kind and courteous. The beds are also very comfortable if you can manage to get any sleep without disrespectful and disruptive neighbors.
50,Never had a bad experience at Mandalay Bay. Staff and upkeep is top notch. Casino floor very space friendly and clean. Food always good and rooms are large. Service on machine was quick. Only negative was MGM rewards line was a wait but once I got to them they were friendly and knowledgeable.
10,Room was dirty when I checked in. They gave me a credit but had to leave the room for an hour. The ac on the floor wasn’t working so it was hot walking through the hallway. The shower would turn. On and off. I was not happy.
50,Make sure to get to the pool early in the morning. Pools are Fantastic. We had great dinner at Lupo. Make sure to make dinner reservations. Restaurant is always busy. The only negative was the pot smell in the hallway...it is sad. But it is family resort. I wish it should never be legalized in state of Nevada.
10,"Worst hotel. This place sucks. Don't plan on being able to use the refrigerator in your room be because it will be packed full of overpriced stuff they want to sell you - like soda for $10. They also load up the countertop in your room with over priced snacks - peanuts $14. Grab an overpriced snack downstairs - Yogurt $8 Sandwich $12. Want a tube for the lazy river? $30!! Parking $18/night. The waterpark sucked. Wave pool only has 1 wave every 3-4 minutes and make you stand ""behind the blue line"" in chest high water so you don't even enjoy the wave. Absolutely no shade on beach. Cabana rental starts $550.00!!! They don't let you use luggage carts - you have to hire a bellhop. Long walk from parking area to hotel. To find a reasonably priced meal need to leave the hotel. We went to Southpoint for their $25 buffet. We'll never stay here again."
10,We try to go into the beach pool for the day staff was more than unfriendly and I think the concierge ladies don’t understand the concept of hospitality industry at all it’s sad that people get treated like that in their vacations just because the personal it’s having a bad day or whatever is happening with them Anyways it doesn’t worth the time you spend trying to even spend the day there!
20,"Despite paying for ""guaranteed early checkin"" I wasn't given a room until 3:30pm. One of the staff at the desk suggested hat early checkin doesn't exist despite it being an option when booking online and on the app. The room I was given had a dirty tub the TV was unplugged and the remote didn't work. The noise from the hallways at night made it difficult to sleep."
50,So much fun to stay at Mandalay with great restaurants for the entire family. The beach sand with waves are out of this world. The rooms are well maintained and clean. We have the panoramic view and enjoyed it every night overlooking the strip.
50,Very nice place and excellent service the game salon is huge and the people who work there are very professional. I took with me an amazing stay and I hope this experience will happen soon again I love it
50,We took our teenage daughters to Vegas to see a concert and wanted to show them a fun resort / casino experience. The Mandalay Bay did not disappoint it was outstanding! The entire property was very clean. Our room had an awesome view of the Raiders stadium which we didn't realize is right across the street!    Every team member we encountered from: check-in staff to the pool chair crew (Richard is a stud!) to everyone we interacted with at the retails stores (Mall/forum) and our server at Kumi (great Japanese restaurant) - they ALL were super-attentive and had fun personalities. We did not leave the property except to go to the concert (which was great - Lumineers at MGM Grand Arena). The experience at Mandalay Bay definitely made this an unforgettable Vegas trip. We will be back for sure    Special thanks to Maral Javanmard for rolling out the red carpet for my family!...you definitely made us feel like VIPs. What a great trip!
50,Sat down to play some Blackjack for the first time in the Mandalay Bay Casino. Audra Diehl was a great dealer; because of her diligence I will be coming back here to play more. Thank you for the great service.
30,Mold in shower ac broken and still didn't work that well after maintenancefixed it no fridge for personal stuff and bellhop is only one can use a cart was late to my event only had one good restaurant in the place
50,Top 5 star service and food conveniently located in the shops at Mandalay Bay. The menu has a nicev ariety of meats for your burger choice and they also have the vegetarian Impossible brand. The burgers are cooked to your specified finish (rare to well done) and are spot on with the order. Tasty and fresh. The staff are very professional courteous and friendly Marissa and Luz greet and seats customers and you feel welcome. Waiter Anthony wad perfect in his attending to my party of two and treated us like most important people. A must dine at restaurant.
40,Rooms look beat up Needs some remodeling and cleaning. Elevators very dirty-going there for years and notice the difference. M life desk ridiculous wait time. Need to bring back desk with more than 2 people working
10,The treatment towards my husband and myself was outrageous. We left before our checkout time with no intention of using any compensation especially seeing as how this compensation was really meant for us to spend more time and money inside the hotel. Racial prejudice over charged multiple charges for items NOT used sexual harassment and the list continues.    Staff racially profiled and humiliated my family on our first day checking in. Adding any days is a nightmare as they sell the room from under your feet as in the room you buy will be sold again before you’re scheduled checkout time. Speaking with managers over the phone is pointless and very rude you must go down to Front Desk/Lobby.    Overcharged on all fronts and will be contacting my lawyer with details both from myself and Mandalay Bay. Solution is still to come.    Anne is a manager located at the front desk she and Carmella also a manager located at the front desk have notes put into my account. They are the ONLY ones who was nice or trying to resolve conflicts created by hotel and casino staff.
10,Bad staff with slow service and no one picks up the phone calls at the front desk. Valet was constantly full. Hotel was dirty. There was a piece of chicken bone in the elevator that I saw sit in the same spot 4 hours later. Staff was not helpful
50,I enjoy my stay .. had great service and everything was convenient. Service was great overall will continue to book here for my stay. My family had such a great time at the pools provided. Had an absolutely fabulous time with family.
40,We live in Las Vegas and wanted to have a Staycation. We chose Mandalay Bay because of the AMAZING pools. We also had been invited to go to see the WNBA Las Vegas Aces play. The pool was incredible you should know before you go to bring your own float for the Lazy River otherwise the floats are $65 for 2 (you do get to own them)... We are now using them in our own pool!    We ordered a burger from the Bikini Bar and I had a Pina Colada - they were both the BOMB! Incredible - Yummy!! Not cheap but you are at a Four Seasons Hotel and the quality was incredible.    We will definitely come back for another staycation - actually we are coming back in November when we see Elton John!!
50,Great value at Mandalay Bay! Was nice and clean has a pool and aquarium  next door neighbors to Luxor and Excalibur with free tram rides . Plenty of things to do at all those hotels. Plenty of night life. Plenty of food choices. Plenty of gambling options! Good stay
40,Haven’t stayed at Mandalay Bay in a long time so I was pleased to see that they have kept their standards high. I have been disappointed with other big hotels. We were only there a couple of nights and didn’t have any issues. Place smelled clean and room was very clean as well. Overall no issues
20,From the start the service at check in was bad. Our booking couldn’t be found even though we booked via booking.com. We asked for 2 rooms close to each other as we are a family with 3 kids but received a poor service and felt almost bad for insisting that our kids should be in a room on the same floor as us. We then waited for the rooms to be ready and when we collected the keys we received the wrong rooms and had to go through the same argument with the check in staff. Staff is patronising especially when the manager is standing 1 meter away and is then whispering instructions like a power dictatorship. All in all wouldn’t recommend unless this hotel sort itself out.
50,Enjoyed the pools restaurants and entertainment. There was always someone to help you find your way around. The resort was clean and the staff very professional. The access to other casinos was convenient.
10,I only stayed here for wedding discount. If you touch the minibar charge. Touch the water or snacks charge. Would’ve been nice to have this clearly communicated. Or at least after the first night be told. Will never consider again. Bathroom needs to be updated or deep cleaned.
10,They charge 25 dollars to use the hotel gym once. Unbelievable. I have never in the whole world had to pay for regular gym access. That is a bit insane.    Hotel is getting old. Not as nice as it used to be.
20,"This is my third stay at this hotel in the last year and will be my last. I can't believe their money grabbing approach to customers - it's incredibly distasteful even by Vegas standards - check it out:    - Resort Fee? Oh yeah - it's $44.22 per day (incl tax)  - Gym Fee? This is new - it's now $25 to use the gym in the spa - and somehow it's not covered by the Resort Fee. If you don't want to pay you can use the cramped ""Cardio Room"" - have fun with that.  - Late checkout? Sure - if you want to extend from 11am to 1pm it'll be $34.01 (incl tax)    So disappointing - I paid extra to choose Mandalay Bay while attending the Summer Market - it's the furthest hotel from the Market Center but I thought it was worth the extra effort and never imagined their money heist. Lesson learned - there are so many options in Vegas I won't make that mistake again."
20,I wish I could give this hotel better rating but customer service could care less about their guest. I booked a suit from July 17th -July 20th the suit was in horrible shape. I had people working in the suit every single day I was there. When I called to make my 1st complaint the person on the phone said “oh yeah that’s the suit that needs repairs. Someone is already scheduled to come in tomorrow!” I said I could not wait until the following day because the blinds did not close and the light from the outside were preventing us to go to sleep. They send someone that night to force shut the blinds. The following day I had reservations for brunch and I did not attend because someone was working on getting the blinds to close. The following day as we were out having breakfast someone came and didn’t enter the suit because I had the “do not disturb sign” they left a note for me to call and have them come back. I never did because it was uncomfortable for me to have males in my room every single day since it was just my son and I. The bathroom door never closed. I made a complaint when I checked out but the lady I spoke to said I had to send an email and they could take care of my complaint. Till this day I have not heard from anyone. Not even an apology for what happened. When you book a suit you expect to get great service and boy was I disappointed and the worst part was that they didn’t even acknowledge my complaint.
20,Don't bother with express check-in the casino's cell service and wifi is well below-standard and the app will fail to connect often. Instead you'd be wise to wait for a long time in line first to get a physical key.
40,I had to circle the hotel several times to return to hotel valet parking on Saturday night. There was apparently a soccer game at Allegiance stadium. One road was blocked by cones and a car purposely parked to block access. I was told to drive to the main front entrance. A traffic control officer forced me to make a U-turn near the main entrance even though was a guest with valet parking and had checked in the night before. Not a good way to treat paying hotel guests paying for valet parking. The lazy valets on the lower level refused to park my car even though I could not access the upper level valet. Why are the valets being paid to do nothing?
10,I’m never coming back here. The elevators were broken had to take the stairs. Room was hot. Expensive for no reason ole ghetto ass hotel. I could’ve stayed elsewhere for some bs like this. I would like a refund
50,Every staff member we encountered were super friendly!! Check in was a breeze and when we got to our room we were amazed at the incredible view and my kids absolutely had the time of their lives!! I would highly recommend staying at Mandalay Bay!!
20,Staff was extremely welcoming and polite    Checkin parking was hectic due to an event in the area. Valet staff stated that all guest had to do valet parking due to overwhelming traffic in the parking garage.    Guest room was spacious but the dirty sheets getting covered instead of replaced wasn’t the best technique.    Thought the red/brown marks were lipstick but when I splashed the dried red stains with my peroxide and it bubbled which indicated blood. I did clean the blood off the wall next to the bathroom mirror. Didn’t want my child touching it.
50,Resort is clean and worth staying for our next vacation. Employees are friendly and accommodating for any request you might need. From front desk bell desk and room services Restaurants are clean and it’s right Inside The hotel ground
50,First trip to Vegas. The hotel was nicely located with access via tram to other hotels and areas of interest.    The pool area was a mix of ages and relaxing with ample space.    Casino had plenty of tables available to play at at reasonable minimums.
40,The hotel was very nice and if you have the MGM app it makes checking in and having a room key very convenient. The pool was an awesome part of the whole experience. We rented a poolside bed and spent the entire day lounging. Don’t tip until the end of the day if you pay for the cabana or pool bed.
40,No housekeeping due to staff shortage. Overpriced meals but nothing that would stop be from returning. Many many restaurants and stores available to conveniently shop within the hotel. Not very many tv channels...no hbo etc. Pool was amazing. Drinks amazing.
50,clean and organized. staff very friendly and polite. totally coming back kids and adults enjoy the pools specially the lazy river. food wise was good couple options. kids had a blast and want to come back hopefully in a couple months.
40,Nice hotel. Kind of isolated from other Strip hotels due to stadium construction. Only disappointment we had was that food choices were limited especially fast food. Grab and go from the convenience store was extremely overpriced.
50,We loved everything about this hotel. Even the the location is not in the middle of the strip it was quiet around the hotel and you can take the transportation to the Luxor and Excalibur and then walk to other hotels or if you have a car you can park free at any mgm hotels which we loved.  The hotel was very accommodating and clean and all the staff was very friendly and took time with us
30,Great hotel the service in general excellent but the prohibition for a guest of the hotel different from other hotels in the area to use the spa facility is a decrease in services and totally different to other hotels.
20,Lines to use the elevators not sure what I was getting for “resort” fee. No microwave or fridge. I really liked the ladies who worked hazel coffee shop they were the highlight. Better places to stay with more amenities for your buck.
50,"Mandalay Bay was a get away for a birthday trip for my teen. The pool was great although crowded. Make sure you bring a sharpie to mark your inner tube. We had people ""borrow"" ours without asking. You can buy at the hotel or bring your own as they have a filling station.    The hotel is at the south end of the strip so if you are going during the summer it's a hot walk to get to Bellagio to watch fountain. Get a rail pass or uber!    Rooms were clean but be aware of moving the items on top of the mini bar or in the mini bar. Both areas are pressure sensitive so if you accidentally move something or pick it up to look at it make sure you don't get charged. Check your bill before paying! Easy to move something and not know."
20,We checked in easily and found our room that as very clean and looked nice. We quickly noticed it was very warm and the a/c was set to the lowest temp it would go. We understand it was vey hot outside so that was probably the reason since the curtains were open. We closed them and left for several hours to come back to it still being really warm. Also NO airflow in the bathroom. Called down and to Guest services and they said they would “try” to send someone. Gee… thanks! We went to sleep and woke to find a sign on out door that said they came by but we weren’t available. Apparently they came at 1:00 am and we had do not disturb on our door. I never imagined they would come that late.  We also had a bad experience with waiting over an hour to valet our car. The valet was very crowded but there was bo effort to keep cars from cutting into line while everyone was waiting so long. The whole reason to valet is to be quick and convenient and you’re paying for that obviously but to have wait so long was ridiculous!
40,Mandalay Bay was a very beautiful hotel that was clean and easy to navigate. Our room was nice and seemed to have relatively new features. We had a strip view from the 24th floor which was great but some others we travelled with were on a lower floor with poor views so I’d recommend getting a higher level strip view if possible. The digital room keys (and even the regular room keys) were a pain and rarely worked. Other than that we had a great stay there were lots of restaurants the Uber pickup was easy to find and it was a good location if you aren’t looking to be in the heart of the strip but still a quick tram or Uber ride away.
20,Cell service and internet service is bad. The elevator situation is horrible. Could never get the room card on my phone to work because the service was so cell bad. Did self check in which was fast but then I didn’t know what was included or where to go for anything
50,Best hotel the city of vegas has to offer wonderful sports book and even better views will definitely check in a few more times before the year is over . So many things to do while visiting the Mandalay Bay
50,A few of my friends and I took a group of a dozen 21-year-old sons and friends To Mandalay Bay for the weekend. Dads and sons both had an amazing experience. The staff was very friendly particularly the dealer and pit manager Lisa Ferguson. We had fun at the tables and in the several comfortable bars. Mandalay is clean and easy to navigate. The rooms are clean and spacious. One area for improvement was that the air conditioner did not quite keep the room cool in the 105°+ heat. We had an amazing dinner at Lupo. Everyone had a great experience. Planning to go back to Mandalay Bay for New Year’s Eve!
30,We arrived 1.5 hrs before check in & our room wasn’t ready. We were asked to wait until 3pm. At 3pm our room was still not ready & were told if we wanted a room now we would need to go 7 floors down so we did :(. We got to the pool about 5pm & there were empty drinking cups & beer bottles all around the pool. Nobody was walking around picking up until almost 7pm. My husband took trash out of the pool. It was a little disappointing & discussing. I have never experience this at a Vegas pool.
50,We traveled with our four boys. Ages-161211 2  The hotel was safe clean and offered something for everyone. The pools were beautiful and cool. The massages at the spa were well worth it for mom! I would take my family again in a heartbeat!
50,I will definitely be back here everyone was friendly and amazing. I was only there for 1 night front desk asked me if I wanted to upgraded my room. And I was like go for it. Make my experience amazing. She offered me a suit. And oh my. Amazing suit. I wished I could’ve of stayed longer
20,Beautiful resort in great place on the strip however there was a lot left to be desired. You pay resort fees but internet service is poor. Pool is beautiful and fun but not kept up/cleaned well. Some of the customer service needs work. Overall I do not recommend.
20,These great pools and lazy rivers are really just children piled upon children horse playing. It’s impossible to enjoy a drink and relax without constantly being ran over. Air conditioning in room didn’t work.
10,Imagine no where to sit and eat your food $20 for chicken strips for your kids but a tiny dipping sauce cup costs $2 each. Just one of a hundred examples and slots tighter than local Indian casinos in the rest of the country. I was there for a whole week and saw exactly zero people win anything more than a few dollars.
50,My husband and I go to Vegas a few times a year and generally stay center strip. We brought our boys last summer and stayed at Vdara. While the room was nice there our boys (14 and 16) were disappointed in the lack of food options.    So we decided to try Mandalay Bay (first time staying there for us). We were all SO happy with our decision. It's not center strip but honestly our trip to Vegas with the boys is more about them so it was perfect. Tons of food options. Amazing pool (althoug it was just very hot to be out long). Quick tram ride to Excalibur which has an arcade and we saw Tournament of Kings :). They loved it! And loved seeing all of the security and police walking the grounds.    We had the 2 bedroom king panoramic room. Had hoped for a better view and higher floor but the room itself was awesome :). Lots of room for us to have our own space. Easy for out boys to hook up their Nintendo Switch to the TV when they just wanted to chill in the room. And they learned to order room service a little too well!...LOL    All in all it was awesome and look forward to another trip there with our boys :)
50,Unbelievable hotel and the beach pool is top rated. Casino floor is spacious and the name bars as well as live music were winners. Late night at the Citizen restaurant hit the spot also. This is a highly recommended hotel for Las Vegas.
50,Always the place to be for summer pool fun- lots of choices and immersive tropical atmosphere. No better place to relax! This is the place for friends family couples or solos. Quick poolside service too.
10,Was given a room already occupied then no one available via phone for assistance they send you to voicemails. Rude staff at the Citizens restaurant. Took over 30 minute get a car from valet they said due to low staffing.
10,I had to wait 45+ min to valet park upon check in. The front desk had no compassion and blamed their 3rd party parking operator (that they hired). Also blamed an event at the stadium that they’ve known is happening for awhile. Awful!!!!
50,This has been our third consecutive year here  we come for the lazy river and enjoy the room and it’s amenities.  The only set back this year was the parking pass situation as it was a minimum inconvenience to keep buzzing the front desk . The Vegas trip is always a great family getaway as we also loved the dolphin show at the mirage . If you are gonna buy tickets for the dolphin show  DO NOT USE THE BARCODE  buy them at the entrance as you are overly charged a 25% inconvenience fee . Trust me  those extra fees could purchase you a meal or at least a few drinks .
50,I stayed here as part of a company trip. The hotel was the cleanest I have ever stayed at and the room was absolutely awesome. The bathroom not only came with a spacious shower but a fantastic tub. The beds were clean and well kept. Although the view was not ideal it was a very comfortable stay. Maybe put a mural on the roof for something other than air conditioners to look at but otherwise it was amazing.
40,Great pool area a little busy but to be expected. The tram is a good option to get you down the strip a little ways. The casino could use a few more slots. I recommend getting to a pearl status on your MGM players card this allows you free parking at any MGM property in my opinion this is a must have option it works easily you can get pearl status quicker with a MGM Mastercard build points before you even get there to receive pearl status.
50,Mandalay Bay always provides great options for dining entertainment and gaming. It is a venue that provides excitement and fun. We always enjoy our slot experience with the variety of machine options that provide us with endless fun.
30,In short I felt nickel & dimed. We paid for the VIP Lounge access at $85.04/day (including tax) was hardly worth the early check-in late check-out and paltry selection of drinks and snacks. Out at the pool be prepared to be crammed into 1/5 to 1/4 of the wave pool presumably for safety reasons. At the lazy river no rafts are provided but you can purchase one at the shop for $32 and change plus tax. For as much as you're paying I would've thought staff would be more available. Our main experience was out by the pool trying to order drinks and food. On one occasion we were given a menu and the lady never came back. On other occasions we ordered drinks and it would take awhile because of the area they had to cover (not enough people). Staff were always friendly though which makes up for some of the downsides. Also for the price you are the end of the strip which is quite noticeable as it is not nearly as crowded when walking through other properties. Rooms did not cool adequately (yes I know desert and all) however central A/C systems are always a problem in large hotels like this. I shouldn't have to keep the drapes closed day and night with the A/C full cold to get a brisk 75 degrees.
20,Poor check in experience. Difficult to unload and transport 4 large pieces of luggage up multiple escalators with no assistance at all. Water temperature in shower was very temperamental fluctuating between ice cold and boiling hot without even touching the handle thus making showering a chore.
50,I had an amazing trip. Thank you to all staff for the cleanliness and friendly environment. Bell hop was very helpful as well as all staff I had the pleasure of interacting with. Thank you very much for a lovely trip to Vegas.
30,Tried to check in with the app but even after checking in it told me I had to wait to 3pm. Understandable it’s passed 3 and no update had to go personally to check in with a person that worked there; kind of defeats the purpose of using the app if I have to wait in line regardless.
50,Enjoyed Michael Jackson One performance! Mandalay Bay has amazing shows snd helps stay at one location for our vacation. Casinos have great slots and enjoyed it very much. Wonderful hotel very good food at Stripsteak too.
10,Not only was the room dirty the TV and air conditioner did not work. The TV got repaired after 2.5 days but we were only there for 3 days. I also was physically threatened by a security guard who after realizing he had the wrong woman just scurried away without apologizing or explaining.
40,Loved the swimming pool and barefoot type bars. Such a relaxing time by the pool. Great room . Spacious and very comfortable Took full advantage of online check in so it was a breeze to park and go to my room without issues.
30,Dumb system of charging for minibar/snacks by a weight system. If an item was moved you are charged! Slow elevators. Ice maker barely worked. The pool has a lot of unreasonable rules that don’t make sense and the wave pool didn’t work. The lazy river is fun but they charge you $30 for an intertube!
50,Went on a Monday-Wednesday trip with my 7 year old and it was perfect. All of the staff was super friendly and the hotel/rooms were clean. There are restaurants for every taste and all of the food places we tried were really good. The pools were really nice as well.
50,My stay was amazing. I can't wait to actually come back. For my first time in the west it was a great time. I hope everytime i come back is as great or better. I have let my friends family and my social media of the great time I had.
50,I had issue with AC one night and maintenance was up in my room and issue resolved within 30 minutes. All staff were very nice and helpful during my stay. Checkout process very clear and easy. I would stay here again.
10,We have never been disappointed with Mandalay Bay till last week. Room was a total fail being it was a two bedroom panoramic suite making our 31st wedding anniversary a big disappoint. I do believe this was an isolated incident but the staff should have been more prepared!
20,the convention center was very far from the rooms. long walk. there was no exceptional service. everything was self-service  so if you don't do your homework and don't study the hotel map it is very difficult to maneuver through the hotel. very few staff at the hotel. I guess everything is digital now no more humans helping each other. there are signs all over but no service provided by the staff.
40,There was little to dislike in the room itself other than the inability to use the refrigerator for personal use. We enjoyed our lovely view and the room was exactly as desired and expected. However we were extremely disappointed by the fitness center which was small crowded dirty and barely equipped. Weights were missing machines were broken water and towels were nowhere to be found. Apparently there is a very nice gym available they are trying to steer people towards given the sorry excuse for an exercise area. The nice gym is available with a spa day pass but the passes were not available during our stay; you would have to book a massage or beauty service to have access. Additionally the beach was a great setup for families with little kids so keep in mind that if you are looking for a nice place to relax by the water in the sun you will definitely NOT find that vibe here anywhere. An 18+ area would be much appreciated.
50,The hotel and property is beautiful. My room was large quiet and plush. The pool area was charming and festive. The wave pool and lazy river kept my family's afternoons occupied. The tram on the property provided easy transportation to other strip locations. I'm not a high roller but I certainly stayed like one.
40,Had a wonderful time. Very clean. Friendly staff. The lazy river was fun. The view from the room was awesome. The atmosphere was amazing and awe inspiring. Parking was a breeze. Really wish I could have stayed longer.
50,Mandalay Bay is located at the South side of the Strip with less foot traffic. This allows you the chance to aboard the public transportation and to get Lyft or Uber to the airport within minutes. Looking forward to returning to this Family friendly Resort and Casino.
40,Mandalay Bay is an amazing place with an amazing pool. Unfortunately they no longer allow guests to work out in their nice gym it is a $25 per day for guest. If the gym has no barring on your decision then look no further.
50,We had an awesome time my whole family enjoyed the pools lazy river land concerts the casino was also great. Many shops and restaurants to choose from. The staff was super friendly and helpful. This place is paradise and Vegas
50,Nice rooms good food love the pool and everything to do... the check in staff was rinda rude. And didnt do any upgrades for the military like any other staff member would of done. Could not buy chips at the cage.
50,Great experience overall! Rooms were clean and very cozy. The restaurants had incredible food service drinks at all the locations I visited. The sports book staff were friendly and the Speak Easy was a nice surprise!
30,Very busy place. Seems only one elevator works causing it to be packed in the morning and evening. Often had to wait for a less-packed elevator. Individual servers in restaurants where polite/professional. Food at restaurants was OK along the lines and big chains. Food prices at these places were high.
50,My wife and daughter met me there they had been in Laughlin for a couple of days since I had to work I decided to meet them in Vegas for a one night with them we had one little incident with a man with a gun scare turn out to be false but scared my little girl but we didn't let that ruin our family stay. Saturday was walking the strip all day and night and Sunday spent it in the pools
50,We had a wonderful time while at the Mandalay Bay/Delano celebrating my birthday! Check in was smooth our room was excellent and clean staff was courteous and friendly throughout the entire stay.    Dinner at StripSteak was delicious and our server went above and beyond to ensure we were taken care of. The staff at the cabana were great! We had a cabana at the west lagoon the staff ensured we had a stocked refreshment fridge at all times and checked in on us numerous times.    We also saw AGT and had a great experience from wonderful seats to great drinks. Everything about this trip was so well organized and all staff that we encountered were so friendly and helpful. We truly had a great time and cannot wait to come back!
40,This was great for work travel. I'm not sure how an average family could afford a vacation at your facility. The staff were friendly space was clean. I felt there was a lack of just common sitting areas outside of restaurant areas. Check in was a little disconnected. I checked in online but when I went to the desk upon arrival I received very little direction as a first time guest.
10,Room smell like feet shower seat broken fell and hit my daughter no manager ever came up only got comped one night last night at seven at night when I finally got a hold of a manager after day and a half because a manager is always busy supposedly never stay again ever worst place only getting pool and lazy river
50,We enjoyed the gaming the bars and the restaurants. My wife was happy there was a starbucks on site. We will definitely stay here again and look forward to bringing the family as well. We will likely come for a game at Allegiant Stadium and stay with Mandalay Bay.
50,Exceptional Property & Resort. Clean wide range of restaurants & activities on site. Staff was friendly and helpful at all times - CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN! Beautiful inside and out - pool area is amazing. Easy access to rest of the strip...but we didnt leave Mandalay Bay much at all...didnt need to.
10,Very bad experience very dirty not clean at all no alcohol sanitizer stations anywhere be careful staying here Martin bad customer service I recommend you not staying here be careful stay somewhere else
40,Was a nice place the food was the best. Very good choices and lots of places to eat. I like to play a lot but the high limit machines were very night lost a few thousand dollars but other then that was a good time and like to come back again in September for my favorite Randy houser. 😊
40,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Accomodations were wonderful room was clean great restaurants and entertainment onsite. I would like to suggest that you provide a receipt automatically upon checkout so that I can submit for reimbursement with employer.
50,I stayed at Mandalay Bay for the first time and look forward to returning. There was a good variety of machines and the rooms are clean.  Citizens and Ri Ra Irish Pub both had delicious food. Everyone was polite and friendly. Can't wait to return.
50,Perfect for Las Vegas. Opulent fun exciting and clean. Room with an amazing view of the Strip. Highly recommend asking for a high floor with a view. The staff was very friendly electronic check-in was fast and convenient.
40,Excellent hotel at the end of the strip. We requested (& paid) for early check in and late check out which all went smoothly. Pool was great although very busy and seemed like there were a lot of seats with old towels on so it was difficult to know what was being used.    Lots of food options - although no longer have a buffet unfortunately.    Room was great but pillows were so uncomfortable and the fridge/sensors were quite stressful with two children in the room! A solid 4/5 and we would return for the beach/pool area most definitely.
50,If you are looking for a quiet but exciting hotel and casino I would have to say Mandalay Bay is the best in Las Vegas. Everyone of the staff from check in to servers on the casino floor are very nice.
40,Room was really nice with a great strip view. Room was clean quiet bed was comfortable. No coffee maker in room unless you pay. You can Not use the refrigerator unless you pay. There are two glasses and an ice bucket. There is shampoo conditioner lotion hair dryer.    We could not get a late check out unless we paid $30 and that was only until 1 pm and there is no guarantee of that until the night before at 7 pm.    The lazy river was packed with people. You need to bring your own inner tube. The pool was crowded. The wave pool was crowded. There were NO lounge chairs in the afternoon. On a Monday it cost $125 to rent a chair with an umbrella and $600 for a covered cabana. To enter the pool area they check your bag no food drink no umbrellas for sun.    Casino black jack started at $25 and $50 dollar minimum. Smoking is allowed in the casino.    Self park is $18 for every 24 hour period.
10,"My family and I were really happy during our stay and after checking out we were thinking of staying here in the future. However an hour and a half after checking my dad realized he had forgot his drone. So I called the hotel and they said they'd let me have access to the room if housekeeping had not cleaned it already. And essentially was told my items would be there if they hadn't accessed it. So we decided to go back to the hotel after being an hour and a half away on the road. We get back to the hotel and front desk goes with us to the room but when we get there housekeeping is already there. Housekeeping looks like she's in trouble and her face says it all but my mom and I never really thought about it (we barely put the pieces together.) She said yeah security swiped everything down (meaning they had collected our belongings because what else would they swipe down.) They let us enter the room to look around but nothing was there. From there we get sent to security. And we tell the what happened. They said to wait 1 to 2 hours for all the stuff to get brought down because they have to go through different floors. We wait said time and still nothing. About an hour in my dad asked a security guard if they had any updates. He contacted someone and said they had our belongings on hand and would bring them down after they finished all the floors. We waited and waited for another 2 hours and two 2 new securities entered the shift however they were both very ignorant and rude (they were both white so we're thinking racial profiling might have been the reasoning to their actions/behaviors because even to an Asian couple the younger security slammed the papers and threw the pen.) These two men didn't help us at all and were being overall rude to us. We asked the first white younger security for the name of the previous security guard and he said his name was Eddie (Eddie was the one that was helpful.) When the older security guys got on the shift the younger man told him about our situation. We waited a couple of minutes and then decided to talk to the older security. He ignored us as if we were invisible (literally played it off like we weren't standing infront of him at all) and asked if there was any way we could talk to Eddie since he was the only one that had given a response of where our belongings were. He acted dumb and said he didn't know anyone named Eddie and I explained to him everything that was happening about how Eddie told us they had got the drone and he replied well housekeeping and security don't know how to do their job they don't know what they're doing. That's when I almost exploded and broke down crying because I was so angry at how they treated me and my family. We gave up and knew it was going to impossible to work with this security guard due to him being so ignorant and rude towards us. We went back to the lobby in hopes of getting more help but still they weren't helpful. We were almost out of the casino and we suddenly see Eddie and he looked like he was coming from the security stand are he looked like he was just been yelled at or something like that. He said oh yeah I was looking for you guys meaning he had talked to the older security guys (who had said he didn't know who Eddie was) and he completely changed the story from having the drone on hand to just having written up the report about the drone. Which we think that's what the other two security guards told him to say so we didn't keep asking. At that point we gave up and just left home. Still no drone and they still can't apparently find it.  But we're sure either housekeeping or security stole it.  Why would housekeeping come out of the room and go back in worried and then tell us ""the room has already been swiped down by security""  But then security says they haven't found it.  So who do I believe the maid who looked suspicious or security who had already collected stuff from the room."
10,Plan to not use the fridge at all. It is stocked full of expensive drinks. Bring a cooler. Check the rates. Booked rates changed on a drop of a dime even after booked stay. House keeping was friendly and helpful.
40,The cost of the floating tubes for the lazy river will cost you more than feeding your family at steak house. Suggestion- bring your own & a blow up device. The staff Is very nice. I only had one that was short when speaking to me. Room service food is good.
40,Mandalay Bay is a very nice property with numerous pools that can be used by individuals or families. The service and check in on-line were very good and I highly recommend the property to family and business people alike.
40,We stayed because there were children in our party and we wanted the cool pools. This resort didn't disappoint in that respect. The pools are great for kids during the day. We rented a cabana and the service there was excellent. The rooms are very nice but had some glitches - one sink faucet didn't work the shower had little water pressure and variable temperature.    The front desk service could be better. The receptionist felt the need to mention that the mini bar was very expensive and this hotel put a security deposit on my credit card. Not sure if the security deposit is typical for Vegas but it was insulting.
50,The resort is crowded as are ALL of them but the front desk staff does a good job moving tired people through the check-in process. All of the staff-everyone- was so helpful friendly and kind. The rooms are clean and quiet and really relaxing. WATCH OUT FOR HIDDEN CHARGES! Pool umbrellas actual available pool shade floats for the pool snacks refrigerator use. A great place to stay
10,The shower was not cleaned prior to my visit. i know this because the shower floor was dirty & hairs on the wall. i didn't submit a complain because i didn't trust that my problem would be solved. after this experience i would just not go back
10,We were victims of theft from our own room and the hotel staff. The system they use to access rooms is electronic so they would be able to know exactly who entered our room. We reported the incident and never received another word about resolving the theft. We did not allow housekeeping to come back in our room during a 5 night stay and this was less than ideal. The beds were very worn and did not provide the comfort or good nights sleep one should expect from a resort. The elevators were also problematic with the keycard system that provides access to your particular floor causing the need to exit an elevator and select another where the scanners could recognize our key.
50,Great stay! Room was huge and the strip view was the best strip view I have ever seen. Fast and easy check in. I have stayed at the Delano and I think the rooms at MB are nicer and newer looking and cost a lot less. The pool area is the best in Vegas the wave pool and lazy river is so much fun. Tubes are not supplied and they charge a lot. Bring your own or get one for cheap at the ABC store or CVS. The only downside is you are at the far end of the strip. But nearby Luxor and Excalibur are fun and the Tram to Excalibur gets you a good head start to go to mid strip. Had a great stay and I will be back.
40,Very average resort hotel. A bit on the expensive side compared to other properties with the same amenities. Location is farer away to the center of the strip so cab rides are a must unless you are trying to get in your 10000 steps for the day.
10,All security guard came to my room and harassed me  No one was taken to jail just bullied  This is how u know nothing wrong happened besides a disturbance  Security should make you feel safe not intimidated
50,I attended a work convention and stayed at the Mandalay Bay. Everything was very suitable and I enjoyed my stay. I would definitely recommend staying here. The one negative was the electronic key. I would suggest getting the standard card key
50,So I hadn't stayed or been to the Mandaly Bay for quite awhile. I bought tickets to see Chelsea play at Allegiant Stadium and this property as well as the Delano are closest. That's the only reason I chose this hotel BUT was really happy with the room the personnel throughout the property were awesome and the overall ambiance was legit. I normally stay at the Cosmopolitan or Park MGM for T-Mobile events but would gladly go back to the Mandaly Bay and will
50,What a wonderful hotel! The pool is amazing! The rooms clean and quiet. Elevators moved lots of people quickly. No waiting in the lobby. Dinning options were great. Monorail to the Excalibur provides quick access to the strip. Be sure to hit the Foundation Room at the top of the hotel for a great experience and view of the strip that’s unmatched!
50,I love this resort why away from the crazy stip not to far but not to closed any way this amazing resort be my #1 for life.love it and the beach pool one my favorite no other resorts offers this unique!!!
20,Stay here only if you don’t mind kids running around with floaters and smell of sun screen lotions otherwise go somewhere else. We were charged with additional room items that we neither used or touched tried to resolve but was on hold for over 15min on the phone
40,Other than getting yelled at by the phone receptionists for asking if I successfully checked out and the bed sheets of my room having blood stains the experience was overall good enough. The Hotel itself is high quality and pricy so the more value the better service should come with it.
40,Casino is located last on the Strip. Have to take taxi where ever you go. Conventional Center is 15 min walk one way. It’s far. There should be conveyer belt. Night clubs are outrageous erotic exotic except Foundation Center. Beach lazy river and pool is fun for kids as well as adults.
50,Never left the hotel besides the airport. So much to do. Convention Center was very easy to get to. Very clean. The staff is very hospitable. Enjoyed the rooftop Foundation. Definitely will recommend this hotel to others.
40,I have been to Mandalay Bay many times over the last 20 years. The service and experience is always very consistent. Friendly clean and nice rooms. Beds are very comfortable. The VIP services and Casino Hosts are always helpful. My ONLY complaint about Mandalay is the location on the strip. It is a bit further away from the main strip. But that also means that the casino floor is not as busy (which you may prefer)!
50,We stayed at Mandalay Bay for five nights. It was easy taking the tram to get to other places on the strip. The property is so clean and really gorgeous to walk around. The stores are great and I enjoyed shopping at them. The staff at Mandalay Bay was so great and friendly. I enjoyed the lazy River they have a blow up station if you bring your own inner tube so that was really nice and saved us a lot of time. The food was actually really good at the pool as well. My favorite thing about the room was the closets had lights that automatically came on when you opened them so I could see my dresses. Plus the toilet has a door so it was nice that I could get ready while my husband used the restroomlol. I will definitely stay at Mandalay Bay again.
50,We had a great stay on the Vegas strip! We enjoyed the Mandalay Bay Resort for a business conference. Everything we needed was under one roof. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would stay there again for sure if given the opportunity.
50,From the moment at check in to checkout our experience was wonderful. Friendly staff. The casino is well laid our so you don't feel crowded at all. Tram is a great way to get to other resorts. I would recommend the restaurants as there is a wide variety to choose from
30,Nice pool not enough staff. No huge complaints but there wasn’t a lot of staff. The service industry it’s really seeming to be going “self serve” and this hotel/casino has jumped on the train. Unfortunate pet peeve of mine. Long line to check in with 1 person manning the desk. Only employee I personally delt with was Luggage delivery and they where straight up rude.
10,Luckily we bring our own cleaning supplies because of Covid but even that wasn't really enough. If it wasn't such a quick trip we would have stayed somewhere else. Not worth the money. We were very disappointed!
40,Good hotel to stay in. Great energy especially on the weekends. Be prepared to walk a lot especially if you're in town using the convention center. Pool closes at 7pm a bummer if you're there in the summer and it's 114 degrees outside in the evening. Also be prepared to go across town for any health and beauty items you might need as there is not a drug store on site.
50,Great hotel. Great restaurant. Go check out Kumi Japanese restaurant !! Amazing flavors. On site… a/c in casino and convention center was a bit overwhelming at times but it has been over 100 degrees outside almost everyday for a while so understandable.  Pack a shirt with long sleeves just in case…
40,The stay was nice but the pools closed too early in my opinion. Food is pretty pricey. I had the chicken tenders and fries at the pool and they weren’t worth the money. Also if you need a tube for the lazy river you have to buy it and I think it’s at least $30. Pretty pricey.
40,Petty and “nickel and dime feel” with wanting to charge you 50 bucks if you move items or use the mini fridge for your personal items. Bring your own water and snacks a water is an arm and snacks cost you a leg.
30,Hotel was very nice but for the amour paid for the room the amenities were very overpriced. The mini keurig was great but if you touched any food or mini fridge item it was on a sensor and you’d be charged. $12 for a k-cup? Seems a little extreme. $15 for a Tito shooter? Or if you’d like to use the lazy River be ready to buy your own tube for $30. Tubes not provided.  I think I gambled enough to earn a bottled water or a k-cup.
10,I will be going back to Vegas with my wife 2 more times in the next few months. This was my first time staying at this property and don’t plan on going back because it was a horrible experience for me. The room was the issue.
30,Whether you self park for $18 a day or you don't want to bother to use their internet. Somehow you still are forced to pay for it I don't understand why it's so expensive to park on your own. We asked for a refrigerator for my little ones antibiotics and they brought a super stinky dirty refrigerator that I had to clean out with alcohol myself. Oh and just be aware that if you stay in any of the rooms with the two beds anybody who showers or uses the bathtub there's a huge gap in between the main doors that anybody including your kids want to keep looking through and they don't lock.
40,Overall great stay. Arrived at 3:30pm and had to wait for our room to be ready. Was not told about the sensors in the refrigerator so when looking at things I was being charged for them. Went to the desk they sent a tech up that actually added different items that were not in room when we first arrived so was charged for items not consumed. Loved the convenience and the ability to get to the other hotels. Staff were very friendly. Room did not cool down only blew out warm air.
40,This was a work trip for our family. We did take a couple of days to have some fun. We enjoyed the Michael Jackson show. We also enjoyed the restaurants like the House of Blues Wolfgang Puck Lupo restaurant and a few others.
40,Visited Vegas for NBA Summer league experience. Really enjoy hotel pool accommodations are little expensive. Need another good restaurant inside hotel/casino. Staff was helpful and friendly from desk to Hazel cafe.
40,We stayed there for 4 nights overall was great rooms are clean it just everything in the hotel is over priced compared to any other hotel in Las Vegas every one in the hotel was very nice and helpful expect that glad on the concierge desk was kind of rude and not helpful other than that it is a good place to stay in Las Vegas.
50,Great place for relaxing. And spending the day. Many of options of pools to choose from. Very clean. Sand was very hot need to wear shoes. Easy to get around the property. Rooms were very clean bathroom was large and tub was awesome
40,Our quick 3 night family vacation was fun. Spent most of it by the wave pool. My only complaint is that you must pay for shade. They do not provide areas with shade for free. So be ready to pay $300 up to $700 in order to get an umbrella or cabana so that your family isn’t out in the sun all day.
50,Very clean friendly great atmosphere pools are great. Food options could been better. Easy to catch taxis. Easy to get to the tram to get to New York hotel. Slots paid better in the morning then in the evenings.
50,We liked our room and everyone working there was great. The casino was exciting even if we didn't come out ahead. :) We especially enjoyed our pool day in the wave pool and lazy river. We had such a good time we're already starting to plan our next stay!
30,There was so much marijuana smoking in rooms close to ours that the nasty odor permeated into our room. It nauseated me. I thought the rooms were all non smoking. Certain areas of the room were very dusty.
50,Probably the best pool complex in Vegas and we went without our kids so we ended up at the lagoon pools for the most part because kids flock to the beach and lazy river. The dining options were good and there were some pretty decent cheaper (by Vegas standards) options to go along with the high-end stuff. The casino was well staffed and never too smoky and we had some of the friendliest dealers and best beverage service here compared to a few of the other casinos we went to. Despite being the farthest south on the strip it is pretty accessible due to the MGM tram that runs to Excalibur and then the ability to walk through New York New York to the tram at Park MGM to Bellagio. All-around great day.
10,no more nice room service dont think about asking hot water for your coffee (its $15 extra). they will through you a plastic bag with your breakfast if you are willing to spend $70 for one coffee one bagel with salmon and 2 eggs. this place is dying slowly.
30,Room need major upgrading as they are dated. Bathrooms smell moldy and fixtures are loose. Walls paper thin and can hear everything in adjacent rooms. Few blackjack tables open and poker only Thursday through Sunday is also a bummer. Can’t imagine can’t get enough action to fill at least 1 table.
50,Very clean. Most staff was friendly except for one person at the gate of the beach club. Would revisit with family. Atmosphere is amazing. Played at the casino multiple times it was always fun even-though i was loosing. George at the black jack table was amazing. It was an experience playing cards with him. George has been dealing for over 50 years. I recommend playing with him if visiting las Vegas. You wl see what i am talking about.
50,Very nice accommodations clean nice view. Easy online check in and out. Great place for a business trip or just for leisure. Lots of extras to give you entertainment and fun. Great for families and couples.
50,We had a great stay. Conference was nice there with good food. Temperature outside was over 100 but was well controlled inside with even some chilly spots in the hotel. Tried the poker room table games and slots. All were well done.
40,We checked in using the app as they suggested this to avoid the long check-in line. I am glad we did as the line was huge when we arrived. The issue is that you get a digital key and it's hard to pull up on the elevator (where you need it). Plus if it doesn't work they expect you to get in that long line. Every time an elevator arrives it looks as though a bust just dropped 100 people off in the lobby. It's honestly crazy how busy this place is in certain areas (it bottlenecks). The room was lovely and the bathroom was large with dual sinks and a tub and shower. There are a bunch of wonderful restaurants in the hotel. The Cirque de Soleil show ONE is fabulous! We were excited to spend the last day of our long trip relaxing at the pool but that place was a mob scene. The lazy river is basically endless people walking in a circle. While the hotel was very nice I don't think I would stay there again due to the overcrowding feeling and location on the strip.
40,I enjoyed my stay here food was good staff was good tables were expensive though. Slots were fun. I was surprised that the following morning after I arrived when going to take a shower that the room had no soap available so I had to shower using shampoo. Asap de from that I enjoyed my stay
30,First time at this hotel and it was beautiful but the staff weren't very helpful. Entire stay was underwhelming. Delano has better staff but the stadium view is ugly and they have loud arss air conditioning fans that kept me up all night.
50,Rooms are really spacious and clean. The bathrooms are large and have both tube and shower options with separate toilet. Great bathroom! I would stay here again for sure. The staff was super nice and helpful.
50,Clean and friendly and great restaurants. Rooms are fresh big and great beds. So many resturants to choose from. Shopping is just steps away. A must see is the Peter Lik art gallery. You will fall in love.
20,We booked in an email. When we got there they didn't honor the email. We were sent to 5 different places with no help. Paid a fortune for nothing. This is the second time we have stayed here and had issues. I thought we would try again because of the pool for kids. We were going for a kids basketball tournament. Our stay at Excalibur was a much better experience.
10,Arrived on time. Our room was not ready. Made us wait for an hour just to get a room for disabled person. Bathroom has no locks. Room was not cleaned as expected. Open the fridge and chinese food was stored by previous occupants. No liners for the trash can and a couple of tissue paper was left inside the toilet bowl.
50,Mandalas Bay is one of my favorite places to stay. My only complaint is the cleanliness of the room. I have not experienced this in the past buy my room clearly needed to be vacuumed. Everything else (the pool food service) was perfect.
50,Love it here for the summer time. Great to bring the whole family. We have options for the kiddos during the day. Take the Tram to Excalibur and spend time there. There’s options for EVERYONE! Always!
10,I had stains on my sheets and blood on my towels. Very disgusting! All my towels and sheets had stains on them. My stay was not good at all. I will not be rebooking here. Even the bouncer at the club was a jerk.
40,The hotel is definitely luxurious and service is excellent. It one of my favorite hotels to stay when I am in Las Vegas. The people at the hotel are always kind and helpful. This would be a good hotel to stay at if you want more of a peaceful stay in Las Vegas because toward the end of the strip. If you looking for a good Spa I would say the spa facilities is one of the top ones of the strip.
50,Waited two years (Covid) had to keep re-booking but the staff was always wonderful and the property is by far my favorite. Treated us all very well. Our pre-wedding beach day was divine and the wedding was beautiful.
40,I went here with some girlfriends and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Loved the spa and the salon! Loved the location too as it was away from the center of the strip. Citizens is a great place for a late night to-go food run. Would definitely return with family and friends!
50,From the great rooms to the awesome pool area and its proximity to the airport… this is the place to stay! The best thing about my room was the spacious bathroom. The best thing about the pool area was their wave pool.
40,It has a beach with a stage! House of blues on site as well as bars with stages everywhere. The bartenders are nice. The Guiness Store was the greatest find right next to an Irish Pub! What else can you ask for?
10,Floor 7 might as well be a jail cell with a view of the airport and big metal Xs blocking the 1/4 length windows. I hated it so much. Tv didn’t work kids had to sleep in the couch. They took 24 hours to fix the tv and wouldn’t give us a change of rooms to a room with actual windows.
50,Check the kids for a quick summer getaway. They had so much fun at the lazy river. Rooms were clean housekeeping staff was so friendly and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. We will definitely be back
50,I like M  andalay because it makes me feel at home I get a lot of attention from floor personal I like the restaurants love shops and close I'm to other casinos like m j show pool is like no other with river and waves cabanas and the fantastic personality
30,We stayed here back in January and we had a blast but this time…they just fell short. There was a short in the electrical of our bathroom when we called the handyman to fix it he seemed so bothered I didn’t want to call for the AC that wasn’t working right. They tried to charge me for early check in when we didn’t check in until almost 3. We were supposed to get a text to check in which never came so we had to go back to the check in desk to see what was going on. The elevator buttons were broken on our floor as well and exposed….another safety hazard. They also do not provide any shade unless you rent a cabana or Day bed. The pools are really fun tho.
10,Stay at any hotel from the strat to the cosmo. Just not worth it with these run down casinos on one end of the strip. Rooms bathroom smelled like cigarettes  never saw my maid  bed was never made and towels were never replenished. I got them from someone in the hallway. Just refrain from hotels on that side of the strip.
40,My sons and I really enjoyed the wave pool and lazy river. My only complaint is the high costs for drinks; $15 for a small pina colada and $4 for a soda! It is expected but it's wrong to charge that much! I also did not like that the inner tubes for the lazy river are not provided. You can buy one for $30!! We walked to the ABC Store to buy 3 inner tubes for $12.  Other than that we enjoyed the resort and would go back!
50,My mom and I came here for our mother daughter trip and had an amazing time. The hotel was conveniently close to the airport (8 minute uber) and was very accommodating. We were checked in early and given a lovely and comfortable room. We had a blast at the casino and beautiful pool. We will definitely be back!
30,Although we didn't really like the location on the strip we did really like the restaurants in the hotel and of course the pools were awesome! The tram is helpful but it stops running at midnight. The pool water is cool which is nice since it was 106 outside!
30,All in all not a horrible stay. Bed was very uncomfortable. Bed sloped very badly from the foot of the bed to the head. Made it extremely hard to sleep. There on business so made for a very long day not getting a good night sleep.
30,Been to hotel before. Overall a nice experience but disappointed no recognition of previous visits with perks or other types of upgrades. Hotel looking a bit tired and worn down. Average value for your money.
50,First time staying at the Mandalay Bay and it did not disappoint. The entire property is very clean and the gaming floor is very spacious . The king resort room we stayed in was very clean with plenty of space. We stood for 2 nights and enjoyed our little getaway.. we will definitely return and book again at the Mandalay Bay
40,Nice room view since i have a disabled person with me its very convenient for her to go around the room and its also nearby the elevator. A lot of restaurant are open now. although we have a little problem on the customer service at MLife rewards (gave me a different card) i'm Platinum but gave me a Sapphire card but it was resolved by the Manager. otherwise eveything is excellet.
50,The Mandalay is just a nice easy way to spend time in Vegas. The online check in process and getting extra keys with their automated process is wonderful. There are so many good restaurants to choose from and the gambling is fantastic. Small enough to not be too crazy but big enough where you aren't waiting to get on machines. I have stayed here at least 10 times over the last five years for business and for pleasure.
50,I actually loved this property compared to a few others I've stayed at in the past. It had more of a laid back feel to it which is what i really liked. The room was FABULOUS! The bathroom was amazing as well! Easy to park and get in to the hotel. Pool was nice and the casino floor felt properly placed. I wasn't met with a lot of smoke as soon as I stepped foot off the elevator as I was at a few other properties. Only thing is the proximity to the airport and hearing the planes at the pool but you get over it quick. This will probably be my hotel of choice for future visits to LV.
50,My husband was there for a conference and I relaxed by the pool every day. We enjoyed walking the strip at night. Took advantage of the tram every day to eliminate a little walking. Staff was great! No complaints!
50,It was great experience to stay here. Everything was well organized and I was amazed to see how everything was well organized. Key less entry using app on phone app was new to me but enjoyed it. Oveall great experience!!!
10,Worst experience ! From desk  Staff was rude … I did mobile checked in around 2 pm … after being exhausted from our flight we needed a shower n some rest . Our room was NOT ready till after 5pm . Our ac in the room was not working good it was hot ! Called from desk n was told they will sent someone to check it out ! All 3  Days the room was hot !!! 79 the temperature wouldn’t go lower than that.
40,The hotel is very nice and provides an array of amenities. However if you’re wanting to go to other spots on the strip the hotel is quite-a-ways from it. But if you’re not this place is A MUST STAY/IDEAL spot for families due to the family-friendly environment it provides!    (Again rating given for location is due to an almost isolate location from the strip)
50,Greatest experience ever I cannot wait to do it again I took my family with me on the trip great hotel rooms. The beaches were amazing and the Sunday pool party was awesome. I can't wait to go again also got lucky at the casino won $800 best experience ever
50,This is the best place to stay ever!!!! in las vegas. For kids and husband we love it the lazy River is Amazing and the wave pool is fantastic this is the only place that has a beach I'm so in love with this place
30,I hated my room no ski view their was blood on my pillow.  I love this hotel but this time I’m not sure why I got the end of the stick  I was here in June my room was also dirty  And I come back in July same thing I’m just going to stay at a other hotel next time
40,amazing slay love money unique beautiful we love Vegas family time love need money best place ever will come back everyday slay baddie love slay family money love this place #family amazing brilliant.
20,This hotel feels like all it cares about is fees. No customer service no flexibility no amenities just high fees and expensive bottles of water in the store.  I get it they’re in business to make money. Aren’t we all? But I choose to spend my money at a place that takes better care of their customers and doesn’t openly gouge me. Because I’m used to the Wynn didn’t know they charge $18 a day for parking. Didn’t find out till check in. 2 bottles of water and a bag of cheezits were THIRTY DOLLARS in the shop. LOL.  Never again. Better places that don’t make you feel so violated even if you spend the same or more
10,Hope everything on you trip goes well. If not don’t go to guest services expecting any help! The left hand does not know what what the right hand is doing. Poor communication! They are incompetent and do not follow through on what they said they will do!!!
40,We loved the hotel my only complaint is not being able to use the refrigerator in the room without being charged $50. This was very inconvenient. The beds were extremely comfortable and loved the pool!
40,Overall the experience of staying at Mandalay Bay was stellar! The only thing we wished was different was parking. We wished it was free instead of $15/day. (NOT included in resort fee.)    We had such a great time at the pool as well. We spent a good amount of time in the lazy river.    We would stay here again.
50,I would like to thank you to Jill and the team for making our stay so special. We were thrilled with the room and an amazing gift. We felt welcomed appreciated and respected. You don’t need to stay anywhere else :) We will definitely be back! Check out the photos - ask for airport views if you are an aviation geek.
50,In my opinion Mandalay Bay should allow guest to take in their own bottled water to beach lazy river swim area. It’s TOO HOT having to walk back/forth for everything needed to be comfortable during hot summer vacation.
50,Casino was really clean and all employees very friendly. This was our first time staying at this casino and it was a great experience will definitely be coming back soon. Tables were on fire!!! Bars were top notch
50,this was a last-minute trip I had never stayed at the Mandalay Bay before. I will again everyone went out of their way to make it a great experience. the room was great and the bed I slept like a rock.
10,1. We checked in on July 4th. The hotel forgot to text me when my room was ready. When i inquired about this delay i was given a key to a room that was occupied by another guest. So i had to come back and wait again to get my correct room. I did not get to my room until after 630pm. I caused us to miss our dinner and fireworks show.  2. While I was at the pool there were kids throwing hard volley balls and footballs. A ball hit me in the back.of the head.  3. The next day I was hit with a football on the side and it made my drink fall into the pool.  4. On our 4th day at the pool there was a fight between a guest and a staff member at a cabana. We were sitting right next to this cabana. It was scary and very explicit. My 7 year old daughter witnessed and heard the whole encounter.  The rooms have no microwaves coffee makers or a fridge. Only their water coffee or candy. Which is $6 for a water. It's all sitting on an electronic plate so if you move it they charge you. Room service is $9 fee. So if you want just French fries it's $19 plus $3 for additional condiments like mustand or mayo. Pancakes are $24. Every restaurant closes at 10pm. There are no food options after 10pm except the market store. You can buy a tuna sandwich for $13 and a small water for $6. No food deliveries allowed either. Enjoy your stay :-l
10,This was our first time to Mandalay Bay. The cabanas and umbrellas were sold out and there was nowhere to get shade / waitress service. I do not like to go on vacation and have to get my own food/drinks. Most of the employees were short and we weren’t made to feel welcome many times. Couldn’t believe there was a $20 charge for a wine opener to be brought to the room. We had two rooms. One room the housekeeper never came not even once during our 3 night stay and then we were charged an extra cleaning fee at departure! Maybe if they would have cleaned at least once we wouldn’t have left the room so messy. The trash was full after the first day what can they expect!?!
20,Even though the hotel pool beach and casino were lovely the room was mediocre small and outdated. The hotel doesn't have complimentary valet/self-parking for guests like Cosmopolitan. The front desk was super unfriendly at checkout. I witnessed Christine do that to myself and multiple guests at the MGM member check-out desk. Christine had a very rude unprofessional attitude toward MGM rewards guests but always has a smile and welcome face with checking-in guests. I felt difficult to ask questions regarding my bill at checkout as she just want to push me out of the door.  I couldn't use WiFi in the room across multiple devices. Talked to the front desk but no solution.
30,Hotel was nice but the lay out of the resort SUCKED lots of walking to the restaurants but it's a Vegas resort I get it but still ! Choices of restaurants are OK nothing great and NO BUFFET ! We had to Uber to the nearest buffet ! Another added expense ! Keep in mind this resort is south on the strip so walking really anywhere to the other gorgeous resort/casinos to see them will cost you.. I mean $15.00 to go maybe 4 mins in an Uber REALLY ADDED UP $$ BIG TIME! To a tune were I should of considered a central strip location at higher rated resort . But again still a nice resort and has aged well..  Rooms :  Rooms were nice but they varied.. I think I had a basic resort king bed room .. my friend checked in a few hours after me got a HUGE ROOM for SAME basic rate  I was baffled since I'm LOYAL to MGM rewards $$! His bathroom was double the size of mine and he had an amazing view . So prey you get lucky and get my friends friends huge room w an incredible view LoL !  Pool is great as always . But I don't think I would stay again just to far down from everything I ended up spending a lot on ubers . End of the day I used there/my shower and pool that is it .. I eat off property mostly every night
30,The hotel was OK. Room was average at best And certainly not worth the rates being charged. Room felt dated especially the bathroom. Tile and shower door really need to be replaced. Could see dirt and mold in the corners and on the trim. Could also smell cigarette and marijuana smoke in the hallways of our floor frequently. Additionally it’s absolutely crazy for them to be charging the rates they do for the bottled water in the room I appreciate that’s it’s Vegas but they don’t need to be gouging people. The restaurants we ate at in the hotel were good with exceptional service especially stripsteak.
30,first room of the room was smell so bad ask to change room. and after changing to new room using shower drain was not working properly and tub drain over flowing out of dirty water and the smell was bad
50,I stay @ the Mandalay Bay every year for a nice summer retreat. They definitely have the best pools in Vegas and are family friendly. My family and I spend most of the days at the Mandalay Bay beach. There's a great Bar & Grill there where you can get breakfast. And plenty of bar areas and waitresses to keep you hydrated throughout the day. We also really enjoyed the food and service at The Citizens restaurant inside the hotel.
50,Good location away from the madness but accessible to everything. Everything you need is within a tram ride away or right in the shopping center. The pool areas are very nice and the staff very helpful.
40,Great accommodations! Beautiful room! Great view of the Strip and surrounding areas! Very comfortable bed! Food was expensive no matter where you went! They need more shade in pool and lazy river areas!
50,It was absolutely brilliant. Rooms are wider than five-star hotels near the strip and have higher quality designs such as bedding and furniture. I recommend the food court and swimming pool because it is very frendly
40,Room was nice. I enjoyed the beach/pool. Friendly staff throughout the property. Disappointed spa was not fully functioning and staff were unaware of it. Store right by the elevator is super expensive. Overall had a good time.
50,Mandalay Bay is a beautiful resort. From the room to the pool/beach the casino the restaurants the stores and the convenience we we had an amazing time at Mandalay Bay. We totally enjoyed our stay. Staff was friendly and helpful. What a fun place!
50,Best gaming experience and great quality of services! Also mandalay bay is part of mgm resorts which you could always hopper to other mgm resorts as well. Also great shows to get entertained best quality shows ever!
30,If you like noise mediocre service gambling and the like then stay here. If no there are many better options. The restaurant options are good but they are not connected to the MGM reward program so you cannot earn your points for the money you spend.
30,This is a beautiful resort with gorgeous pools and doesn’t have the seedy feeling of some of the others. However—we were there for six nights with 2 adults and 4 kids. We needed 4 queens connecting rooms and I called ahead to ensure our request could be met…I paid for early check-in. We arrive 1 room is ready and we are informed the other room will be same floor but down another wing. I told them that won’t work. So then we moved floors but it would be 1 king and 2 queens connecting; but their ‘give’ a roll-away. Next the one room finally ready at 3:00–the connector will be available “soon”. We were informed at 10pm that the room was finally ready. Our rooms were cleaned once in 6 days—ONCE! We called and complained and they said we’ll be on next rotation…nope!
30,The beds were comfortable minus the pillows. The rooms were decent and a nice size. The staff at the pool areas were horrible and made my outdoor experience miserable. The 21+ pool staff was friendly at least getting in but the music was so insanely loud that I had to leave. I frequent loud rock concerts often so noise doesn’t typically bother me but this was just awful. I had to turn around and deal with the millions of children and extremely rude staff over sitting in that piercing loud noise!!!
30,After 3 days of driving we arrived to find that our repeated requests for strip view adjoining rooms was not available    This made check in a nightmare and after 2 hours (which meant kids missed out on pool) we got adjoining rooms that had garbage on the floor poor plumbing and a 19th floor view of parking garage    We chose Mandalay for pool and the view for our kids first trip to Vegas - pool was great (minus $$& we had to pay for a seat with umbrella on 44 Celsius day) but not having view was very disappointing    Mandalay is far from everything and we will choose something mid strip for our next Vegas trip
30,Ladies please do not get on the elevators by yourself. Parents no matter how safe it feels please never allow your child to walk around alone. Things can happen so quick. Although you need a key card to get on a particular floor anyone can jump on the elevator with a group of people and jump off on any floor.
50,My wife and I decided on a short (4 day) getaway before becoming first-time grand parents so I decided to take advantage of my MGM Rewards points and chose Mandalay Bay as our destination with NO regrets.
50,"Can't say enough about my recent stay (Father's Day Weekend)! I was already in Las Vegas at another ""swanky"" venue on the middle of the strip. Loving it but my daughter called to surprise me there with my two grandaughters. My current hotel could not accomodate adjoining rooms with 2 queens in one and a king on the other. I frequently stay at MB and knew they could and would if at all possible. I called and was treated by the most accomodating phone representative I've encountered in a long time a big plus in Las Vegas or anywhere else these days. Within minutes I had secured the accomodations I sought. The check-in (Fri PM) was effortless my daughter did it all on line in minutes as I (a boomer) stood in line. The rooms were beautifully decorated exceptionally clean and comfortable. The bathrooms were large and comfortable. Large tub for the girls separate shower for the adults large vanity with all the necessities. The Beach Pool. If I had to say a 'negative' it is that it's a victim of it's own success. It is perfectly designed-The sandy beach the wave pool the children's pool the lazy river. is in my opinion that vive is unmatched ...but then there is the crowd. Seems that everyone at the hotel liked and enjoyed it as much as we did. I enjoyed having my early mornings quiet time at the coffee shop steps from our elevator We enjoyed the cafe but did not do any of the plethora of restaurants available. My mistake I wish I had but I try to be mindful and respectful that many people don't feel that Las Vegas is a place for a 2 and a 6 year old and didn't want to ruin anyone else's experience of the fine dining available. Obviously to be law abiding and to not cheat my grand-daughters of their first 'Las Vegas Experience' I didn't do much gaming this trip but have many times in past trips and I've never encountered a problem or an attitude with the gaming staff. The casino itself is expansive but well equipped with the latest and popular machines my wife has never left wanting. And I've never ever encountered a rude unfriendly unwelcoming table games staff. And lastly The Spa. If you're there and need some quiet relaxation and personal escape time I wholly recommend it. My grandaughters  daughter (and I) really enjoyed the Shark Reef exhibit. It doesn't take long to experience and it is very well done and informative. If you want to see an immersive presentation of a lot of the aquatic creatures found in the oceans don't miss it. Both my grandaughters throughly enjoyed it. All in all thanks to MB's short notice hospitality I had a terrific Father's Day weekend and I am currently trying to schedule a return trip solo to pay back their gratious hospitality."
50,We stayed for 5 nights in the Delano King Suite (2 kids 2 adults) and me being a 7 months pregnant mama when we came down for our sons basketball tournament. The room and bathroom were so nice and spacious we loved all the amenities the hotel had to offer including the “beach” 🏖 and the aquarium. It was so nice to have everything there right at our fingertips entertainment dining etc. Although the hotel is huge and you can expect lots of walking they make it very easy to navigate. The hotel is nice and quiet at night and we didn’t experience any rowdy guests or inappropriate behavior around the kids.    We will definitely stay again for a family friendly trip!
30,It has become ridiculously expensive at this hotels (and many others). They are trying to make up the losses if covid years in 1 season. Small yoghurt 8 dollars rent of 2 sun beds and an umbrella 600 dollars at the main pool (didn’t do it) and on and on and on….
30,The rooms are great but the guy at bell desk was rude to me when he returned my bag. I didn't get his name but he acted like I was just an inconvenience. The guy at the actual desk was nice though. The lady at the mobile check in wasn't helpful when I went to ask her about my room at3:30pm and why it wasn't giving me a key.. mobile check in was a horrible horrible experience. Said my card didn't work but still authorized a 1 cent transaction 3 times?? Finally got a room around 5pm after waiting around for 5 hours I arrived at noon here. I had a telehealth appointment at 4pm that I had to do a precruise covid test. Due to bathroom being closed I had to perform the test out in the open with everyone staring at me thinking I was sick or something. Very stressful check in experience for sure. Lady who got me checked in was amazing BTW. It's pretty ridiculous that I have to wait until I get $10 in rewards to use it in the slots. Thats like 1000 bucks .. I ain't rich. Wave pool was really nice. The river thing was too shallow to enjoy.
40,It’s a massive property so be prepared to walk but they have a lot of great dining places and shopping in the hotel. The water park was nice but got packed pretty fast. Especially the lazy river. The check in process needs some work to be more efficient. And as with all hotels in Vegas the stench of smoke hits you the second you get close to the casino area. So gross. I think we would stay at MB again but would prefer somewhere more centralized on the Strip.
50,First time here and he took great care of me ! Definitely will be coming back. He’s the best will recommend others to go! Very clean and professional. Thanks !  Name: turf admasu  Department: front desk
30,Great hotel if you are a family way too many kids under 10 years old running all over it’s more like Disneyland @ the pool. Hotel and Casino are stil good restaurants very nice not cheap but nothing is in Vegas anymore!
20,the hotel was nice & clean but that one staff was very rude & disrespectful.. we simply asked if there was an available room that we can switch to and even willing to pay for difference they said no but we did simply understand that it was a weekend the hotel was very busy & everything was booked.. but we did not appreciate the comment that the lady at the front desk made she said “there is only one available room upgrade and it’s the presidential suite i think its out of your budget and can’t afford it!!” that was very unprofessional and my rude thing to say. you don’t know what we  can afford and not! we can if we wanted to but we don’t need it at the moment.
10,Awful check in experience due to our room was not ready for almost 5 hours after check in time. The pool closes at 7. The only shade you get is if you pay 400 bucks for a chair and umbrella. Otherwise there are many umbrellas but they won’t put it up unless u pay. Disappointing room service food and absolutely no Wi-Fi so therefore every day was stressful to get up and down the elevator since u need a room key for every floor. Very annoying.
50,We had an amazing time especially in the pools! One thing we did notice though there were a lot of kids horse playing and jumping into the river and almost on top of people I didn’t like the fact that it wasn’t being monitored or regulated. But for the rest we enjoyed it.
50,I had a great time & everything at Mandalay was great. My favorite place to stay! Early check-in went smooth. We tried some new restaurants & especially loved Ri Ra. The coffee shop outside the elevators is fantastic.
50,After gaming custody of my grandsons in March this was a needed vacation to get away with some friends our life has been turned upside down and all of our plans for retirement have been put on hold. Las Vegas has always been one of our favorite places and this time Mandalay Bay was the cheapest of the MGM resorts.
30,The rooms were nice enough and the bell men and the check in provided good service. The prices on everything else were high and did not get good customer service - basically none at all- from the lost and found.
50,The mandalay beach is amazing and staff is very friendly! The casino floor can be bit vast and one might get lost but it’s worth the visit. If it’s your first time make sure you utilize the MGM rewards program as you can get some great perks
10,Skip it. Especially if you have a family or a dog. Staff is rude. Elevators are in need of serious repair. Hotel rooms are run down. No screen casting. All round worst Las Vegas hotel experience we've ever had.
50,The room Is cleaning and comfortable the staff Is nice the hotel Is beatyful extremadly happy my family y neoyorquino the Pool the food is delicius Good experiencia in the casino drink Is a Good taste parking Is confortable
50,Great hotel. Clean rooms soaking tube amazing and seperate from shower. Places to eat within the hotel are bomb.com especially the Mexican restaurant upstairs. All staff provided excellent customer service. Pool was a bit crowded and locker prices were outrageous $20 bucks! It was $10 should be $5 especially when drinks @the pool are insanely expensive 2 drinks med size $30+ so catch a buzz before going in to save money. Lyft from airport cheapest way to get to hotel $16. Arrived mid week and left Friday that also saves a lot of money.
40,Great spot and fabulous staff and service. The problem was the constant mechanical hum in the room that was torturous while trying to sleep. A bit disappointing for this property. But otherwise the room was great except for sleeping.
50,hotel room and pool where amazing the slot machines where not Friendly though I would recommend the hotel and amenities but not the slot machines. Very clean I will come back but I will not play the slot machines in the casino
10,Worst hotel experience ever vacationing in Vegas or any hotel for that matter. Rooms were hot and housekeeping doesn't care about your privacy. and management really doesn't care to get back to you regarding issues and restaurants that are supposed to be high end were horrible and got us sick
50,It was a very good stay. Rooms were very clean and the location of the strip view was great as well. I would really recommend the hotel to my friends and family. The pool was clean and at a good temp.
30,We stayed in room 5118. The Restroom was dirty and moldy. Shower had mold on the bottom corners. The tub had hair in it. The restroom wall paper was coming off exposing the mold. Will definitely consider a different hotel for next stay.
50,I love the rooms at Mandalay Bay. Everything is so comfortable. The casino is great too. They have a great selection of games. It’s a great hotel. I have stayed here twice and really love it. I highly recommend staying here.
50,Very impressed by the Mandalay Bay. Southern most resort on the strip keeping it a bit quieter and relaxed. Less hustle and bustle compared to other resorts on the strip. Wonderful restaurant options our favorites being The Border Grille (modern Mexican) and Lupo (Wolfgang puck Italian)  Pools were relaxing and enjoyable. Would highly recommend if you aren't looking to be right in the craze of the strip. We had no complaints about our stay. Very pleased and would definitely choose to return here.
40,Mandalay Bay resort is very nice and reasonable if you prepare and do things smart. Tips that helped us:  -bring your own tube for lazy river(they charge $30 if you buy one there)  -bring water bottle and fill in water stations near pool bar when you walk in or Bikini Bar or fitness center. (They charge $8 for bottle of water  -do not touch fridge coffee cups/maker or mini bar snack and beverages. Fridge is weighted so you will get charged if you moves stuff or store you town food.  -Buy a styrofoam cooler or rent tiny fridge for $35 per stay. Cooler was $5 at Walmart and there are ice machines on every floor.  -Get groceries and snacks delivered from Walmart on first stay to save money on drinks snacks and breakfast. We got bagels cream cheese crackers cheese yogurt and snacks.  -If you are coffee drinking get Starbucks iced coffee or other coffees you can drink over ice. Bring gallon ziplock bags for clean ice storage. There is Starbucks in lobby but long wait.  -walk to convention center for food court options to save money. Subway Johnny Rockets pizza Nathan’s and Asian place.  -Take the free tram to Excalibur or Nee York New York and walk the strip from there. Target and CVS are near there too.  Our stay was great because we pre-planned. The room was large and bathroom huge with two sinks. Everything was clean workers were friendly.
40,Stayed here 4 nights with kids 7 and 9. Property has many restaurants on site and links to Luxor directly (excalibur via free tram). Kids enjoyed the lazy river. Bring your own tube as its $30 to buy one of theirs.    Further down the strip the scene is busier so we preferred where we were.    Wave pool was a disappointment.. one wave every few minutes.    Rooms also seemed tired. We stayed in an Elite King. Room was spacious but we had broken furniture broken light switches and outlets falling out of the wall. Overall was clean and comfortable but fell below expectations. Also no fridge available to put drinks or snacks.    I would stay at the property again but hoping for a room update.
30,First off - we are not gamblers. My review might be different if we were. We came to Vegas for a National Volleyball tournament and the games were in the MB convention center. The room itself was comfortable - good beds linens shower - and the fitness center was big and well stocked. But boy do they nickel and dime you for everything. The in-room coffee was $6 a cup and the pool umbrellas were $100. The convention center did not even supply water for the athletes until the third day (after probably dozens of parents - including myself - complained). The staff was nice but not very knowledgeable. We were glad to leave after 5 nights.
50,Had a great experience at Mandalay Bay. Easy access to a lot of activities including so much on Site between the food offers and Bars. The pools are Amazing. Clean and organized. Rooms were Very clean on Arrival and stayed that way. Awesome Staff
20,I’m so disappointed with this hotel during this stay. Used to be one of my favorites. I had a horrible experience at check in finding they didn’t have a room for me because of cleaning crew staffing issues even tho we got there late to check in. They did give us a room after I complained about loosing a dinner reservation and they gave us a room BUT to our surprise the room was full of plumbing issues. They just wanted to get rid of me at the front desk so they gave me this room with a terrible view. They did wave our resort fees but it was NOT worth it. I would have rather pay the full amount but get a good room. Also throughout the whole hotel staff was cold and the restaurants were TERRIBLE! worse quality than Applebees. No joke I couldn’t believe how downgraded this hotel became:(
40,Great entertainment food & drinkspool and comfy rooms! MJ One show was fantastic and the kids enjoyed the aquarium and pool area. Slept well and enjoyed the amenities Mandalay had to offer. Many options for food too.
50,Have been visiting LV once or twice a year for the last 20 years. Have stayed in just about every property on the strip & Downtown over the years but never considered Mandalay Bay due to the dreaded location. What a huge mistake! We came in 7/3 to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. Everything was perfect. Stayed in 57231 with a beautiful view of the strip. Great customer service as everyone we encountered was courteous & professional. Pool and restaurant choices were over the top. ....and as far as the location issue? Had absolutely no problems quickly accessing anywhere we wanted to go. Had a lot of fun ( & a few wins) in the casino. Everything exceeded our expectations and it was a damn near perfect trip. MB has now become our favorite spot on the strip
30,After spending a couple of nights we have a few take aways. The biggest areas for improvement are guest amenities and pool issues.  Guest Amenities-zero bathroom items such as cotton or qtips. Powdered creamer. Etc.  these items would cost less than $1 per room night and would add so much to the guest experience.  Pool issues - not one umbrella in the entire beach area. Not one. Unless you paid for a private chair/day bed. And the lazy river is absolute mayhem. They should only allow people to be in floats. It’s was mostly extremely out of control teenagers jumping in diving splashing and going crazy. Also charging $30 for an inflatable tube is crazy. Rent them possibly? We were also billed for items we never ordered at the pool.  The hotel also does not have air filtration like newer hotels such as Aria so cigarette smoke was intense.  Room was clean though and pillows were comfortable.
40,Overall the hotel is quite nice. The rooms were clean. The only problem and that has nothing to do with service or rooms is how dark the casino floor is. I really love lighted places when I’m a patron.
40,Superb faculty with an abundance of choice of restaurants and entertainment. Pool was excellent the free lounge chairs were suitable and there are premium spots for rent (with umbrella or a whole cabana). We visited Shark Reef Aquarium which was shorter than expected but had many different species to explore and interact with. Overall a pleasant experience but prepare yourself for sticker shock if you’ve been away from Vegas for awhile.
30,When we arrived we were able to check via our mobile app which is very convenient although adding a picture was cumbersome because it doesn’t accept it if you don’t have good lighting. We tried about 6-8 times before it accepted the picture. We got a third floor room and it took a while before it showed us the option for the digital key. So we went back in the reception to ask the personnel assisting guests and she said it’s too low ask for a higher level room. So then we went to a different line and finally relocated to 30th floor. When we got into the room the bed was comfortable. The AC was working and the bathroom has 2 sinks which is awesome. However there is no fan in the bathroom. If someone is pooping it will stink the entire room. If someone is having a shower it will moist the entire bathroom. When I first used the toilet it smelled like someone was smoking cannabis inside the washroom. I know because I know the smell and when you’re smoking in the washroom tobacco or cannabis it will take a long time before the smell disappear. The shower was okay. They give you 2 small bottles of shampoo and a small bar of soap which I wished this was liquid vs bar. We never used the tub and they don’t give you a bubble bath anyway so not sure how I’m going to enjoy that. They also do not have robes for you. For this price of hotel I was expecting robes and slippers atleast. But nope none of those either. They have two kinds of water which are both not free. Smaller bottle for $12 US dollar and bigger bottle for $25?? That is absurd!! They have a small convenience store downstairs which has the same price by the way so if you want to save money go into a convince store outside the strip! During nighttime the garbage can beside the elevator gets filled with garbage from some rooms in the floor and it smelled tobacco and cannabis in the hallway and elevator. We saw someone walking smoking his tobacco by the reception. When you pass the casino there’s people smoking cannabis or tobacco swearing cursing yelling or something else. Not very kid friendly if they are just passing here going to the restaurants after the hallway of casinos! There’s no other way to go to the restaurant from the lobby without passing through the casino u less you go outside and walk around the other side of the hotel. The restaurants are high end and have the best customer service though! I will not stay here again unless they have improved those I mentioned above. I also would not recommend this hotel to family with kids. Perhaps to a couple who doesn’t mind the smell of armpit tobacco and cannabis!
50,We stayed overnight and had a blast. With ease of check in/out and cleanliness this place marks off all our boxes. We loved all the attractions and dining that this hotel offers. We will definitely be back again soon.
50,Great hotel and easy everything!! We stay here for the pools and rooms!! Very beautiful and a hotel you won’t want to leave there is so much to do! Plus it’s a 10.00 cab ride anywhere but mostly the best part is the pools
50,Me and my boyfriend spent 4th of July here and had an amazing time at the beach pool and enjoyed our hotel room which was very clean. Loved the shower it was very spacious and nice big tub for a regular king size bed room. We had dinner at House of Blues and loved the service and our meals.
50,The pool alone is reason to come and stay here. Go in the am though as things get hectic from noontime til closing. The staff is very friendly courteous and accommodating. We will definitely come back here in the future!
20,Looks like cleaning team are not prepared to clean perfectly the rooms. the hotel is good over all but really bad experience on hotel room. It happens again problems with room. It was my second time in the hotel.
20,There was left over chicken in the refrigerator that stunk. I don’t know how long it was in there. It made the room smell funky. We let front desk know but no options were available nor did they try to help make are stay more comfortable.
20,i checked in 01july 8:00 pm this year and my room wasn't ready and unfriendly staff told me that i have to wait until the room got cleaned and he didn't tell me waiting time at all. I reserved two queen beds and he just offered me a king bed if i don't want to wait. he didn't even look sorry for that.
20,"This hotel does not provide refrigerators and microwaves in the rooms. That was disappointing. You can get a refrigerator if there is a medical reason. You can rent microwaves and refrigerators for a daily fee. You can also rent roll out beds for $40 a night but they were sold out when we tried to get one. There were long lines in the lobby to get on the elevators for our tower of rooms. The rooms were clean but nothing special. The cleaning staff removed our towels and did not replace them three days in a row. They of course would bring more up but this is after waiting on hold for room service. This hotel was nothing special for the price. I would recommend another hotel on the strip with a better ""theme"" that would be more fun and more family friendly."
40,Resort was gorgeous. Pools were super fun. Housekeeping is amazing and restaurants are delicious. I loved being able to charge everything to my room.    Only issues: Bus stop is very inconveniently located. And front desk staff was not very nice to multiple hotel guests.
40,My husband and I stayed here for three days. Overall it was a great resort- clean nice amenities and lots to do. We enjoyed the access to the other nearby resorts for different entertainment options and the tram made it easy to get from one resort to the next. We especially enjoyed hanging out at the pool during the daytime. A couple of things we would do different however. We were confident we would want to spend a lot of time on the lazy river suspent about $65 on two Floaties at the store near the pool area. We would not do this again. The lazy river was way too crowded and so it was a waste of our money. I definitely recommend not spending your money on this. As for food in the resort we very much enjoyed the border grill and highly recommend that. Excellent food great portions and the service was decent. We also had great food at the steak place however it was exceptionally overpriced and portions were tiny so we would not do that again. Another observation we had was that we were a little removed from the action of the strip. This could be a positive or a negative but it is definitely further away from the other hot spots on the strip.
30,Too few blackjack tables throughout the stay. The pool area may as well be a water park for kids. Way too many kids and babies running around splashing and screaming. Positive side is the casino area and room were clean and appeared well maintained. Note it is at end of strip so be prepared to trek to other quality casinos.
50,Love Mandalay. The pool is excellent. Lots of great restaurants. The casino is entertaining. Customer service is high level. This is our second trip to Mandalay and both trips have been awesome. We will be back.
50,Family of 5 with 3 kids. Chose Mandalay Bay for the lazy river and wave pool and it did not disappoint! Location is at the end of the strip which is not ideal but the tram to the Excalibur made it easy to get to the other casinos.
50,I picked mandalay for the pool. But was pleasantly surprised by the huge room with soak tub. The super convience of check in on the app. Ability to review bill on tv and also do the checkout at same time. No standing in lines after getting off planes is everything. Ability to make reservations same day for meals was great. I truly font like waiting in l I ne for alot.
50,The service and hospitality was excellent. We spent one day at the pool and the service was great. The restaurants on this hotel are excellent and not too expensive. The service our entire trip was enjoyable.
30,Lobby manager provided no courtesy discount or comps for next visit. I paid $300 more for the same exact room same floor and the lobby manager said she couldn't do anything about. Very disappointing ending to a vacation that could have been a perfect 10. VERY SOUR ENDING!
10,Room was dirty and not made up daily even after calling housekeeping. Outlets falling out of the wall and furniture beat up. It’s a conventions hotel so pretty beat up I guess because of all the traffic
50,Beautiful room and resort grounds service left something to be desired. Particularly the checkin lobby staff needs better service and manners. Paid for early check in and did not get room until 5pm! Went to check out and was going to billed for early checkin until I questioned it and noted we did not get our room until 5pm! We got there around 9am!
20,I realize the room was a good price but then add for parking high cost for everything and please couldn't you spare free coffee in the room?! We travelled from Tucson to Sedona to Grand Canyon to Zion and every single one of those hotels offered coffee in the room! Also please improve your signage. It was difficult to find your way around and Team Members were difficult to find. Please have staff at front desk be more clear about using the garage. I had to get redressed and go back to the front desk (I was ready for bed because we had to leave for the airport at 3:30. )and wait in line again to have them recode the key to be able to leave the garage.
40,We stay for the 4th of July week and boy it was crowded everywhere in Vegas. But Mandalay Bay have enough pool to go around love the wave pool and the lazy river still more to go around. Got the connected room making the stay more comfortable for 4 adults and 2 teenagers.
50,This hotel has great amenities and amazing staff! Get up have some breakfast at the seabreeze cafe then get down to the pool to secure a great spot early so you don’t cook all day!!! Fabulous tram to get you to the Luxor and Excalibur! Helps save on Ubers!!!
30,Mandalay is not bad. Clean and the staff is very friendly. It's all the way down the strip though the monorail doesn't even go down that far so you will either need to do a lot walking or waiting for buses and trams.    The pools are alright but not worth the premium over those at other MGM properties. The rooms are clean with nice showers & bathrooms but they charge you for EVERYTHING. Most hotels give complimentary coffee in the room but apparently not in Vegas. And they charge $22 for a bottle of water in the room. The floats for the lazy river need to be rented too. It feels like you end up paying a premium to be at Mandalay but end being nickeled and dimed for everything there.    We go to Vegas at least once a year so far Mandalay was
50,Just a quick get away to recharge and watch all of the fireworks from our room. It surely didn't disappoint! It wasn't as crowded as I expected but I'm sure that has to do with the economy. Still had a great time.
50,Very great time for my wedding to my lovely wife. All events was done very professional and so well with all employees so so kind. The food was so good and tasty and all the vendors servers were gracious. It was very humbling to be treated very well.
20,This place is great but has absolutely no perks like other casinos. Parking is a rip off players card sucks now and it’s very dirty in the hotel hall ways. Early check in is a complete waste and a joke
50,I enjoyed my stay here for a volleyball tournament. The pool is great parking was easy and it’s a quick walk to Luxor and a quick tram ride to Excalibur and strip access. Plenty of restaurants parking us $15/day and the mini bar pricing is nuts (don’t even pick it up or you could be charged) and overall food is $$$ everywhere inside but so is all of Vegas bring your own inner tubes for pool (can inflate there)
50,Beautiful property with a fantastic view! Great casino! Awesome wave pool and lazy river! The House of Blues restaurant has the best bread pudding! Easy access to the airport being the closest. Awesome staff!
10,Check in lady staff was soooo rude.  I do not even know how to describe.  My room floor upgrade request was denied in a very rude way as well.  And all the beverage servers were not professional at all such as forgetting what I ordered or taking 40 mins to bring.
30,The room was ok. nothing special. beautiful swimming pools but no umbrellas to get some shade. very slow to get someone to fix the TV. charged me for extras at check out. we didn't use any refreshments but they still charged me.
50,WOW ! What an incredible place. No detail left to chance...everything was perfect. Rooms were immaculate and comfortable. We enjoyed all the pool areas and the lunch options. I was Nanny for my grandchildren and we had a great visit. We never left the facility.
50,Fast check-in  Awesome room with wonderful bathroom.. the tub!!!!  Friendly staff at pool!!!! And the beach cafe. Will be coming back next summer!!!  Only thing I would say that could be better is the elevators being so slow and a huge line to get on.
30,Overall a nice hotel but they over sell rooms and then upgrade you to more expensive rooms at check in! Was not expecting to pay that much! Pool is overcrowded and cost for tubes are extremely high! We will probably not be back.
50,Room was amazing in terms of space and cleanliness. We had a view of the strip. Staff were helpful particularly housekeeping. Casino staff were also good. Only thing we didn’t quite like was the sensors on m the hospitality bar. If you move a coffee or and don’t put it back right it will charge you for it. Had to call and have a charge removed.
10,I whould never stay here again the sercity are so rude and so are the staff really horrible place i had a better experience at a cheaper hotel which it should be the other way around the room cleaning lady walked in when i told her not to and the sheets were really really stained
50,This visit was exceptional—the room was ready early it was spotless and the AC worked perfectly. Luxurious bathroom with designer touches. The bed was so inviting and comfortable like sleeping on a cloud. Linens were soft and spotlessly clean. Lobby was spotless and the air smelled like a tropical garden. Staff were outgoing and helpful. Beach lazy river and pools were refreshing and no trouble finding empty chaise lounges on the sand. Cannot wait to return.
10,As I stated previously the shower floor was dirty a dead bird on the ledge fluorescent lights that looked like they were there for years and years and years bird crap all over the ledge and to top it off they had a live band outside performing until midnight
20,My family and I every year stay at mandalay but this year was really disappointed… room really dirty the firts day we couldn’t take a shower because the shower was broken… plus they make pay twice at the valet parking every single day even though I try to get help to resolve this issue no one couldn’t help me
50,"I felt that every detail was planned ""to the t"". We had mobile check in didn't need a car because there's so much to do inside the resort including the event center for our tournament and check out was just as smooth. We left our bags with the Bell Desk and were able to retrieve them from a kiosk. The only downside was the digital room key system which did not work for us."
50,The room was comfortable with all that we needed. I do hate that you have to go downstairs to get coffee but all the Vegas hotel don’t have coffee pots in the room. The view was beautiful facing the strip. Easy access to the Luxor using the tram.
20,Mandalay Bay has lost its shine. We were disappointed with the overcrowded pools and lack of food and drink services on a Tuesday and a Wednesday. Purchasing tubes for lazy river is ridiculous. The price of tubes could affordable at least. Lazy river was full of people running in it with no tubes. Room mini bar ridiculously priced. We were glad bellman told us not to touch anything unless purchasing; items on a sensor and charge would be incurred. Rooms very warm even tho ac was on maximum cool setting. We kept our curtain drawn to help cool room.
40,Hotel and Casino were very clean! We stayed in the Elite King and was very impressed with the room!  Only down side was the pool area had way more kids than we thought it would. It was still fun we just came to Las Vegas for a couples retreat adult time. Rented a Cabana and this was not what we were expecting. We had a great time and even got to watch the Avalanche win the Stanley Cup while we were there!
40,We stayed for 4 days mainly to watch the LV Raiders vs Denver Broncos football game. The hotel is located very close to the stadium so that was convenient. The rooms were spacious and clean. The hotel staff was very nice and professional. The only issue was on the last night there was no water from about midnight to 6 AM. NO WATER at all you could not bathe or even flush the toilet.
50,Mandalay Bay is a beautiful property. My kids really enjoyed the pools! The food at Seabreeze was delicious and the shopping was pretty good too. My daughter and I got tattoos at Starlight which was a fun experience. The shark reef is beautiful.
50,you honestly never had to leave the resort - everything was there - food shopping casino outside activities - great time but not enough time for personal fun was there for business. Definitely would stay there again if in Vegas.
50,I absolutely love Mandalay Bay! Their slot machines are not crammed together so things always feel open and airy never claustrophobic. Their service is excellent and the employees do their very best to help however they can. I will continue to stay at Mandalay Bay when visiting Las Vegas!
50,Great restaurant choices great room! Our favorite hotel/casino in Vegas! The new menu at Aureole was AMAZING!!! Breakfast at Citizens is always excellent! Staff is always so accommodating! We will be back!
50,I’m leaving this review because I feel like I made two friends at the black Jack table during my stay here last weekend. The dealer Enne Bond and Supervisor Laura Alfano really stood out to me. I played black jack for countless hours straight and was sad when they had to close down the section. It was not about if I was up or down on chips but just about having a great time with the two of them. They really added to the overall experienced and when I saw Enne in passing the next day I made sure I stopped and played at her table until her shift ended. The Mandalay Bay is lucky to have these two as the casino floor felt like a friendly welcoming place to spend time rather than judged solely on the outcome of the cards. To me that’s the highest compliment I can pay to a casino. Thanks again for the great time!
50,We came in on 4th of July weekend. When entering the staff was friendly and helpful the room was clean and the price for a holiday weekend was reasonable. We also loved the pool lazy River and wave pool. Overall a great short getaway trip.
50,Beautiful hotel and casino. Enjoyed everything about the hotel. I had guests from all over. It was a wonderful celebration with my family and friends From the restaurants to the shops and the concierge. Everyone was pleasant. My wedding guests are still talking about the hotel and their experience.
50,This trip was great during the week (Wed-Sat) in the middle of June. Since I gamble with the MGM branch I got the room highly discounted. There was a club open that was free for Casino guests and the promoter suggested other club/lounges locations with other MGM casino partners. The pools and lazy rivers are amazing for all age groups and they have plenty of options in case you don’t like certain crowds.
50,This is my favorite hotel for many reasons. Great staff pools rooms & food. I had a smooth check in and a fantastic time. The tram made it very easy to go further in the strip and staff kept the pool area very clean
40,I loved the hotel/resort. Everything was perfect. My only issue is the fully stocked refrigerator. I understand the resort wanting people to use their items however it would be nice to have place to put items I bought without being charged for the removal of their items.
50,My first time staying at Mandalay Bay. I really enjoyed my suite except for the fact there was no refrigerator storage available. I had leftovers from the evening before which I kept and ate the next day thinking it’d be OK but ended up getting sick. I had taken a friend of mine for dinner at Lupo and we had a great meal and drinks and the service was excellent. I couldn’t finish my meal even though it was delicious so I had saved it.    I found the slot machines at Mandalay especially my go to game Fu Dao Le we’re way too tight. My friend spend $2000 in the high limit room and couldn’t hit one bonus.    The part I enjoyed the most was Mandalay Beach. The wave pool is fun and refreshing after lying in the hot sun but my favorite was the lazy river where I spent an hour floating and relaxing each day of my stay. They sell inner tubes at the pool store and I would’ve spent $30 if they’d had a color other than green but since they didn’t I was on the way to Target where they referred me to go for mor selection when I saw ABC Stores and they had inner tubes in many colors for only $3.99. I bought a pink one there and was happy to get a color I liked and saved $26.    I am returning there in August but staying in a Superior Penthouse Suite at the adjoining Delano. I can hardly wait.
50,Everything was wonderful!! Beautiful and clean room. Awesome casino! Restaurants were very good! We attended the Michael Jackson show which was spectacular!! We will definitely be staying here in the future.
40,Overall experience was fine the room was clean. Since I was on a higher floor I had to use a select set of elevators where the card reader needed to access your floor wasn't working on one side which took awhile to figure out once others were complaining about it too. Location is a bit far from the main strip so be prepared to walk or take transportation.
10,"The staff were rude from the beginning of our stay. My wife experienced an extremely rude valet who brushed her off because she pulled into the wrong spot on accident. Wouldn't let her check in because they said she wasn't on the reservation which isn't true because I always put her on there. Made her wait in a massive line three times with sick screaming kids and all our luggage. She was treated so badly that she had to call me in the middle of a important business meeting crying because she didn't know what else to do. None of the staff cared at all. The only reason they fixed it was because she refused to leave the front desk and demaded her be able to check in. Finally finding out that her name actually was on the reservation and it was their fault. While at the pool I asked a worked where I could find the towels and she responded ""The same place you got them when you walked in..."" I responded ""I didn't get towels when I walked in that's why I'm asking you."" Never again will I go back to this dump."
50,This hotel was a perfect stay for me and my family. Everything you need is right at the resort. Food entertainment casino was perfect. Had to spend no money on traveling within Las Vegas because of everything is right there. Will definitely be back next month.
50,Love staying at the Mandalay Bay because of the awesome staff pool restaurants and nice rooms. We’ve been coming here for years and we’ll be back soon. The lazy river and sandy beach area is something that has created great memories for me and my family.
50,The staff at the VIP Lounge where all wonderful as were the rest of the service staff. The hotel has amazing restaurants and bars. The casino had high ceilings and the smoke was not as bad as other hotels on the strip.
40,Overall Mandalay Bay is fantastic. The hotel is clean the crowd was mostly well behaved adults and a lot of families. The food choices are good. The pool is simply amazing. The beach setting feels very real. The wave pool is great. The waves are big enough to knock down a grown man. The Moorea Beach club was awesome too. The one thing negative is the prices. Forget about having a drink in the mini bar. It was almost $20 for 12 ounce Bud Light. The restaurants are also very pricey for what you get. But that’s Vegas. When (not if) we go back we are staying at Mandalay Bay. If you’re looking for a wild party look elsewhere. If you want a nice classy resort on the Strip stay at Mandalay Bay.
50,Nice rooms everything right there in the establishment such as restaurants stores. Pool was awesome and the wave pool was excellent! Room was clean and relaxing. Great service at the front desk. Great stay at the Mandalay Bay casino resort
50,Great stay. Stayed for a family vacation. Kids really enjoyed the wave pool and the lazy river. The rooms were clean and spacious. The beds were comfortable. The blackout curtains were great as we slept in and needed the darkness.
50,great time enjoy the pool and the lazy river  won a jackpot excellent dinner my room was with a great view don't forget the shark reaf and the best is the great customer service from everyone.....
50,Everything was perfect and we like the service and the room . Specially the view was excellent. The elevators were sometimes busy and it was hard to control ourselves from Covid . Someone should be stay at the area to help people .
20,MGM rewards needs to get their act together and provide better customer service. The cleaning crew needs to be more thorough (eyelash extensions all over the room and the Keurig filled with coffee grinds and not cleaned).
50,The staff was wonderful. The room was awesome. We had s strip view. The only issue was the safe. Everyone one was really wonderful. The only issue was the safe didn’t work. I called & reported it right away. I was told someone would be up to the room asap & that we had to be in the room. We waited over a hour & no one showed up. We called again was told they had dispatched someone & they should be there soon. We waited another 45 minutes before we my husband called down there & told them don’t bother sending anyone up. That we couldn’t wait anymore. He had a meeting to get to.
50,I love this resort . Our family of 4 stayed here. We had a blast. My kids love the pool. The resort is big and have everything inside from relax shopping and food is great . We will definitely come back .
40,Stay was average not quite what I expected for the cost...cleaning staff were great. Access in and out of the parking garage was very easy as was the Uber/Lyft access. Overall I enjoyed the stay but as I stated earlier I expected a little more for the cost.
40,Pro: Great stay rooms are wonderful very clean staff was great plenty dinner options hotel was up to date  Cons: no outdoor seating by front entrance…you have to stand when waiting or tired at the pool if you don’t buy cabana you don’t get an umbrella. There is no shelter from the sun except palm trees.
40,I booked this room and the beds were very comfy. We didn't get fresh towles until day 3. Pool cabanas at the Delano needs to be upgraded. we picked that one because from the pictures it looked to be the nicest out of the 3 pools. The cabana was dirty and not sure I would pay that price again.
30,The hotel was great. Upon check-in we had to wait until approximately 1615 and had to cancel our dinner plans. Our friends rented a cabana for the Fourth of July. Staff was great and kept the fridge stocked with cold drinks and other items delivered in good time.
10,Extremely expensive. No refrigerator included. No microwave. At venue for a large youth sport tournament and it was horrible for that. Had to buy a cooler to try to store drinks or pay $9 for Gatorade at the venue. $6 banana. If hosting youth events then should have reasonable prices. Needs an area for teens to hang so they aren’t walking the disgusting streets. Glass shower in bathroom not ideal either
10,Too expensive  Pool area way too crowded and no access to umbrellas without paying $200. No fridge in room. No microwave.  Pool charged different prices for same drink. One place had 5.50 for 12 oz coffee another had 5.50 for 32 oz coffee.  No free coffee in room
50,Loved staying here!! Pools are awesome! Staff friendly. Had awesome entertainment. Definitely would recommend to family and friends. Only downside is I could not find an adult only pool that would have been nice.
10,if i would have known that my watch that was a limited edition would be stolen i would have picked another hotel. This was my first experience and i was shocked that the management made no effort to contact me prior to leaving or offer any type of reparation.
40,It was a beautiful hotel. I got a night comped being an MGM member which made it more affordable for us. I just didn't like how far it was from the main strip location but it was still fun and enjoyable. Would still stay again
30,"My wife daughter niece and myself stayed in a 2 bedroom Panoramic King suite for 4 nights at the end of June. We chose this hotel because of the pool since we had the kids with us and were going to hang out there more than gambling. Well the wave pool is a bit of a joke. First off there are a ton of life guards in the water and at the edge of the pool which is great for safety but it also felt like every time I/we took a step one of them would blow their whistle at us as we had done something wrong. You can only stay in between certain lines in that pool. You can't ride the wave in at all nor can you sit in the shallower area and have the wave crash in to you. Basically you could stand there and when the wave came every 5 minutes you'd kind of roll up with the wave and then sit and wait for another one. I'm not exaggerating either when I say 5 minutes between waves. Here I thought that the waves would be more frequent and that you could play around in them...not the case. There is zero shade around the wave pool. A bit of shade around the lazy river but really hard to get seats there and minimal shade around the other pools. The sand was 300 degrees which is understandable since it's summer and 110 degrees out but there was nowhere to chill in the shade and just watch the kids swim. Well there is and I inquired about it. They have 2 rows or red chairs at the front of the beach. These are a little nicer chairs than the regular ones around the pools. I asked about renting them for the day and the pricing is outrageous. Each chair is $100 for the day and each umbrella for shade is $100 for the day. So for the 4 of us it would cost us $600 to sit on a little more plush lounge chair with an umbrella. Not happening. We ended up spending most of our time at one of the side pools but they were so small by early afternoon they were too crowded. Some shade would be nice or maybe even a few umbrellas spread out amongst the chairs for us peasants.    They pushed us to do mobile check-in which I didn't really want to do but obliged. We are gold MLife members so can use the vip area for check-in but there were a few people in front so decided to go with their suggestion. Once checked in she said our room would be ready in a few hours and they would text us. It was 1:30 so even though we were early I figured our room would be ready or ready sooner than a few hours. After I finished with the mobile check in I walked over to the vip check-in and asked about our room just to see for sure. It took him 7 seconds to tell us our room was ready and he'd get us our keys. Perfect off to our room.    Our room was large with 2 big bedrooms and bathrooms which was nice but the centre 2 sitting areas were kind of a waste. The layout was just odd. You walk in these big doors in the the foyer then right in front of you you have a small bar height table that can fit 4 sort of. At the end of that table there is just a wall dividing the 2 parts of the room. I'm guessing they run ducting and electrical own this wall as I see no other reason it's there. It separates 2 sitting areas. One with a small couch and tv and the other with 4 chairs and a coffee table. So 4 people could cram on the one couch and watch tv out there or sit on the 4 chairs to chat and have a drink. No more people than that could fit on either side of this ""wall"". We actually just watched tv in our room and the kids did their thing in their room.    Maid service came and ""cleaned"" the room each day. Made the beds changed the towels the regular stuff. But they for some reason never took the garbage. We ordered food form Uber Eats a couple times packaged it up nicely when we were done and left it by the garbage can and it sat there for 3 days of our stay. I didn't understand that. We tipped each day as I know they are working hard but why leave the garbage?    The hotel is actually really far from everywhere. We knew it was far but this was just too much even with the tram. If you wanted to get a snack you only had the one little store at the lobby which obviously was way over priced. Oh speaking of overpriced you can't bring anything in to the pool area (food or drink) and they have a little store there. Nothing has a price on it so I asked the guy working there what stuff costs and he said nothing (talking drinks here...water gatorade beer) costs less than $15. For a bottle of water? I think he may have been wrong but I wasn't going pay that. I walked to a nearby gas station and was able to get a case of Corona beer for $10.99 as opposed to $15 for 1. Got some water and gatorade as well all for decent prices. It was a bit of a walk in the heat but not too bad.    Anyways Vegas has changed. Prices are out of control for everything everywhere and I don't see how it can survive charging what they do.    Cliff notes...    Pros...  Nice casino and lobby area.  Not too crowded and not as smokey as other casinos    Cons...  Way too far away from anything  No shade at pool  Food prices anywhere near the resort are ridiculous  Drink service on the floor was non existent. Was offered a drink 1 time in 4 days    We didn't mind our stay but would not return to this hotel."
40,Me and my fiancé went down for a quick weekend. Overall we had a good experience with the hotel. Service was good and room was clean. The elevator system had issues. Other than that we had a good experience there and are planning to go back in September.
20,My room wasn’t ready upon check in. Had to wait an hour. Digital key didn’t work staff tries to push for mobile check in however too many issues with this method. Finally the tub in our room was dirty. Too many issues resulting in bad review
10,Last thing I wanted was to start my trip with an argument with the front desk it’s bad when I have to de-escalate the situation myself. Creating a seen at the front desk I politely told the front desk stop 🛑 I don’t want to talk about the situation I just want to get my room key please. I don’t see why it wasn’t already ready like everyone else walking in all they would say there name and room key was ready. I was even cut off so they could give someone there key when I was first trying to check in. Then when I come in to try to check in staff was to busy for me they were trying to update something in the system or put something in the system 3 people behind the counter and 2 people checking in me and another person and had to wait. Just get me in my room and send me on my way how hard is that? VIP service definitely not worth it.
10,What a huge disappointment. I’ve had better stays at a days inn and a cleaner room too!! Was disgusted and (literally) made sick at how full of dirt and dust our room was. We both have allergies but my fiancée’s are especially bad and the room actually made her ill there was so much dust everywhere.  The pools were small had very limited hours and were extremely overcrowded so it was impossible to enjoy them.  I was under the impression this was a nicer “dress code” hotel/casino but people were walking around everywhere in wet swimsuits ripped jeans leggings etc.  we went to get married but ended up not because of how sick my fiancée got from the filthy room.  Also there were empty bottles in minibar when we checked in. Absolutely no response/apology from management/staff
50,I love the resort as it is pet friendly and spotless.  The room is comfortable and the staff is very knowledgeable and kind.  My only bad point is that I worked hard and came to support my teenager for his championship volleyball tournament. I was hoping for some relaxing time by the swimming pool between games and swimming a little! Well not at this resort as it is crowded with families and children playing/ jumping/ splashing everywhere! So if you come hoping for a zen weekend at the pool this is not the place!
30,My check-in experience could have been handled better. With the volume of people who stay at MB they need to ensure rooms are ready by the check-in time. I went to one agent and was told my room was not ready. Then they had issues with their chip reader which then I went to another agent. She was now to give me a room and her chip reader was working properly. When I get to the room toilet had dried urine from the previous guest and I only had 2 bath towels and no Kleenex in the box. I was missing hand towels and face towels. All in all it wasn’t a terrible stay. But definitely not a good 1st impression.
30,Prices are great! But the rooms need major updating and more ammunition’s like they don’t provide a microwave in your room or a fridge to store your stuff. We had a $375 diner - yes you read that and we couldn’t finish our $45 lobster Mac and cheese or all our $71 steak. Had to eat with fingers and cold because it was $15 for silverware! A little too much insane! Also food prices have doubled and you don’t win more on any of the casinos. But I would come back. Just need a few changes.
50,Enjoyed my time and this was my second stay at Mandalay Bay. The staff was great and the effectiveness of their crew to prepare things for a convention is kinda remarkable. Highly encourage others to host their events at this location.
20,Booked our room months in advance performed early mobile check in so we would arrive and our room would be ready. Arrived room wasn't ready at all and they gave us a worse room and the length of time taken to (poorly) fix the issue caused us to be late to a show. All around unexpectedly poor service. Not sure why I bothered booking in advance if it didn't matter.
50,Overall everything was great and I will be back and will stay at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino. Everything about the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino was a good and happy experience. Thank you for everything.
10,Me and my wife we barely sleep for four nights. Window frame was missing some parts and there was a tape around that was making loud whistling sound from the wind. After first two nights we switched rooms and guess what the same tape around the window and the same loud whistling sound. I expect better quality for $300 a night! I have videos and pictures of two rooms. Im demanding reimbursement!
10,The staff was not very attentive to our needs. There were safety and cleaning issues during our trip. I called about our door sticking and not opening and closing properly. The front desk made notation and said he would have maintenance check and resolve issue. No one came up to help us. I also requested to have our room cleaned and likewise no one came out. Our toilet was clogged and many staff was not helpful. Very poor service.
50,Here for the volleyball nationals championship. Everything we needed was right there. Good foodgreat pool.great entertainment for the boys and parents. The moms enjoyed our nights out. We got to go to the concert in the pool. What a great experience. Thank you
10,We weren’t staying at Mandalay Bay but We went to the Rhythm and Riffs Bar located next to the casino for one drink. I ordered 2 drinks and our bar tender Tony decided to give himself a $3 tip on top of the $28 for 2 drinks after I had signed off the check and returned to my seat. Whilst we were sitting I received a notification from my bank that the charge for the drinks had been deducted twice. We went to the bar and the bar tender was nowhere to be seen. I asked to speak to a manager who advised the bar tender had awarded himself a $3 tip which she noticed was a mistake and had generated a refund for the extra round of drinks which we did not purchase. She advised this would take 24 hours. This happened at midnight Sunday evening. If we did not receive notifications from the bank then we would never have known we had been charged twice until a later date.    When Wednesday came we still hadn’t received the refund which was supposed to have been processed 3 days ago. This was the last night of our time in Vegas before moving on on the Thursday so had to take time to go back to the bar to see the manager. We spoke with another manager this time called Alan who advised the refund can take 72 hours. We explained the situation to him and he advised if we hadn’t received it by the time we got home to email him and he would fix it. He then said he would be 5 minutes he was going to get his business card and would be back. 30 minutes passed and Alan hadn’t returned. I asked the bar tender to contact him as we didn’t have time to wait any longer. Eventually ANOTHER manager came to speak with us and advised the same thing that the refund can take up to 72 hours. He provided his business card and said to email him if we don’t receive any refund in our account.    The bar is a shambles with bar tenders adding tips to customers checks which is fraudulent practice. From my experience Management have very poor service and do not make any attempt to resolve any problems that they have generated. This has now been 8 days since the transaction was falsely deducted and still NO REFUND. Will never be back to Mandalay Bay biggest mistake going once for one drink. It should be very simple for a resort as big to fix a simple error for $28.
10,I hate to give a bad review and please keep in mind that this review is to help families coming to Las Vegas. To sum up: Mandalay Bay is for adults that want to “sin” only. NOT FOR FAMILIES. Let me explain: we arrived in Vegas at 8:30 am. Tried to check in at 9 but they only had pre-checkin. We understood this since checkin is supposed to be at 3 pm. No worries Mandalay allowed us to check our bags. Besides all the tips so far we hadn’t spent more than $50 (except for the room rate). The customer service rep was REALLY rude. Not sure why - she said she would text when the room was ready. She estimated around noon. So we went to the many shops and restaurants. We ate a very expensive lunch and then we went back and waited on the floor (NO SEATING) near an area downstairs. We waited until mid afternoon. Many of our friends had arrived and checked into their rooms so we knew there was a mixup somewhere. I finally got a different rep and he said that the room had been ready for a while. He apologized and said he didn’t understand why the first rep did not text. This was painful - sitting with young kids in an area NOT good for kids. Smoking was everywhere - I didn’t realize it was legal to smoke in the casinos and we could smell smoke everywhere in the hotel. There were women in thong bikinis or g-strings everywhere. The homeless on the steps and sidewalks around the resort and they scared the kids. The truth is that Mandalay Bay is a gambling resort / casino for those adults looking for “sin”. We thought Mandalay was more tamed compared to other resorts but that is not true . Just like everywhere else Mandalay caters to high-rollers. They could care less about families - I don’t blame Mandalay; we learned our lesson and We just won’t ever make the mistake of going there again.
50,This hotel is beautiful and has awesome amenities. Check in and out was a breeze and they only charge $15 a day per parking. However the noise level was extremely nerve wracking for the price. The lights on our bathroom made a clicking noise after they were on and they even turned off on me when I was in the shower. I heard guys loudly partying and a barking dog. Over all I’ll stay here again
40,We enjoyed our time as a family at the resort. There were many great experiences especially dinner on Friday night at Strip Steak. The staff was courteous and friendly at all times. We will consider Mandalay Bay for out next outing.
50,We visit Las Vegas often and have stayed at different hotels by far this one is the best. The hotel was very clean staff was friendly and helpful and our room was huge. We stayed in a king elite basically a suite. Yes the room decor is a little dated with the blue color but the size and comfort made up for it. The breakfast at the Sunset grill (I think that was what it was called) was delicious. You get a good quantity for your money. The pool area…oh my! We had no problem getting chairs and enjoyed the lazy River. You also have access to the Delano pool area. We liked this one better because it had less kids and music. A must…. Lupo restaurant (Wolfgang Puck’s) in the hotel. The best shrimp Linguine I have ever had. My husband’s steak was delicious as well. Service was Impeccable. We also went up to the Federal lounge on the 63 floor. Nice view but in my opinion not worth the cover charge. Hotel guests should be free and maybe others charged a cover. It was a very small area and no place to sit. If you ordered bottle service ( basically a private sitting area $$$) that was roped off and you had your own security. We will be back to Mandalay Bay for sure.
10,Didn’t see a waitress at the pool for 8 hours. There is NO coffee in the room without spending 10$ for their “kit” and DONT TOUCH THE CUP. It’s on a sensor and you will get charged for it. You also can’t get a cart from the lobby without a person that accompanies you and of course they expect a tip. It’s just ridiculous how you get nickel and dimed.
30,I have been staying at Madalay Bay for years. Worst exerpeince ever. The mobile app never works right. Our room had bedding on pull out bed that was used and never taken off. Found brace rubber bands and other trash from a previous occupant of the room. Still had ice bucket liner that was wet from previous use. The plug under TV didn't work after 2nd day. Tub faucet leaked 24/7. I was offered credits which never showed on bill and i had go downstairs to request them at checkout. Asked for itemized bill and was told that's not possible so unsure if I got my dining credits from room package of my $150 for the dirty room. I was also given a vocher for dining on hotel that is only good for 90 days after I was checking out that I can't use. I booked hotels bungalow for Beach that said it had solid walls but a curtain to one side divided us and my neighbor was drunk and loud as can be making the bunaglow not very relaxing. Lots of trash all over pool area especially lazy river. Resturant at beach serves inedible french fries. Many foods were out of stock but I get supply issues. Staff was awesome. Wave pool is fabulos. I have been a customer for years and this stay was disappointing. My MGM rewards also didn't properly update and I have to work on that. I will give it another try otherwise changing hotels
50,We wanted to get away for a few days. So we took an impromptu trip to Las Vegas from San Diego. We got more in in three days than I have in my last three trips to Vegas. It was a blast. But the constant when our hotel. Great service friendly people it was clean great pools and we ate at two great restaurants. All-in-all it was a great trip. We will be back to the Mandalay Bay reall soon.
50,We went for a girl’s trip and none of us had a single complaint at all. From the accommodating staff to the clean comfortable and very nice rooms to the pools and experience—it was all great! I’d definitely come back and stay here.
50,The whole experience from start to finish of our trip was so wonderful! We will be going back to this hotel for our next visit for sure! The staff from accommodations and Casino was amazingly attentive to any need we had and even when we didn’t ask they were on top of everything! The grounds are beautiful! Lots to do!
40,Staff is friendly check in was easy through the app. The room was nice but had some peeling wall paper a loose bathroom door handle and the shower drains backed up and drained slowly. We had a great view of the strip. The pool was great. The tram was handy to get to other properties too.
50,I think that Mandalay Bay is a great hotel to bring the family. Very safe and the pool area was exceptionally nice. I liked that the cabs and Uber rides were in a convenient area and the hotel itself was very clean.
30,Check in staff unfriendly not helpful  Housekeeping had to be requested to clean room and provide toilet paper.  Was there Monday through Friday and that was literally the only time housekeeping came to our room. Never have we experienced this there. Hopefully our next trip will be the way it use to be. The wonderful place it was again
30,We were with a team for a Volleyball Tournament. The refrigerator was locked and was unable to use it. One parent was able to open theirs move all of the stuff to make room for theirs and was charged $200. Ridiculous 🙄. I used an ice-chest with dry ice then their ice for the rest of the week once dry ice no longer worked.
10,$700-800 for a standard room $900 for a cabana and they came by twice to refill ice despite multiple requests pool restaurant was understaffed and won’t let you sit down hotel was clearly overbooked. Check in was after 5pm.
50,Good stay fun for the kids and adults nice staff good pool had a great time the rooms were clean and I like the keyless entry made the trip so much easier I always lose keys and I liked the fact I could use my phone instead. Hotel was good didn’t stay in room too much room was dark on hold to long for help for lights so stayed in the dark. The kids had a super time regardless and we were happy with hotel I’d stay there if you love to have fun and don’t mind the dark too much.
10,The room floor was super wet and the room was dusty! I asked for help and all they did was sent someone to place towels all over the room floor! I asked why there was no snack on the snack bar and they told me they could do it in the next day or 2 !
30,The rooms give a great first impression and comfortable beds. Unfortunately the isolation is poor and nosiness from pool area  night parties and crying babies makes it really difficult to sleep. We stayed for 8 nights and we were longing for a good nights sleep. Even though the hotel has a beautiful exterior and pool area there are many flaws. Every thing cost an arm and a leg and you are not allowed to keep anything in the minibar( 50 dollar fine). The water is costs 22 dollar a bottle. There are much better hotel options in the area.
30,The hotel was very clean and the staff were helpful. The bathroom was AMAZING and so was the view. A few problems though the internet went out while staying but was quickly fixed. Also there are snacks on the counter and opening the refrigerator have sensors and if you move the snacks or open the fridge it will charge you. Other that that it was a very nice hotel but not extraordinary for the price.
50,We had a great time at the Mandalay. It was fun we ate good food and had so much to do. We enjoyed the beach the Shark Reef and Michael Jackson One. Since everything was all within the resort we rarely left.
50,Family trip to Vegas on way home from Hawaii. Hotel was lovely as was the staff. Weren't able to check in until after 6:30 pm which made it a little difficult as we were tired from flying but staff was very nice
40,We enjoyed our stay here! The beach is awesome however pricy to get a bungalow or umbrella so be prepared to pay cause it is HOT there! Staff was super friendly and multiple options for dining. Convention center was able to house our conference adequately. While this resort is on one end of the strip there are two trams that are free and connect to other free trams to give you options to visit other resort properties see shows and look for meal options.
40,Catalytic Converter was stolen from rental car that was parked in the hotel parking garage. Other then that fantastic stay and time in Vegas! Staff was friendly room was clean. Ate dinner at the boarder grill inside the hotel amazing!
40,Overall had a nice experience at the casino. Staff was 50/50 nice and rude. Food was average and drinks were delicious but very expensive! Overall good hotel and enjoyed the stay. Not sure if I would stay again
50,Great hotel! Super easy check in process great rooms great restaurants and first class service! Location is perfect and easy to get to where ever you need to be. Pool is great as well with wave pool and lazy river.
50,Mandalay Bay Casino and Resort is the premier resort in all of Las Vegas. Beyond excellence in guest services eateries and hotel room luxury. Not to mention the outdoor resort playground it will leave you breathless and wishing to never leave!
50,We had a great time coming here as a family. The pool was great for our 2 year old son and also the aquarium. The shuttle was great to get down the strip. The room was great but no fridge to store our sons drinks such as milk. Besides that it was great. Definitely will stay again!
50,Room was extremely clean bed and pillow very comfortable.like the fact it had a tub.down fall the app does not give you access to choose a closer room to the elevators when you check in through the app.
40,The entire hotel experience is great - room entertainment restaurants. The casino has the smell of smoke that you can't escape. The selection of restaurants and being able to walk to other hotel areas without going outside is a nice perk. Besides the smoke smell it is great.
30,Hotel was nicely decorated bed was comfortable and the pool was enjoyable but everything is extremely overpriced. Check in process was a nightmare. Had to wait more than two hours for a room assignment. Lines were always backed up at check in. Seems hotel isn't properly equipped to handle the large number of guests that it attempts to accomodate.
40,Our primary reason for selecting this MGM resort property was for Moorea Beach. Which my wife and I absolutely loved! That said our next trip to Vegas will likely be at an MGM property closer to the center of all the action. We’ll be back to Moorea but only as day guests.
50,Great 1st time going to Las Vegas and speaking at NACDA    Great resort to hold a business convention… everything you need to hold the conference and you can bring a family with so much to enjoy… looking forward for the next conference
50,My kids and I had an exceptional stay at the Mandalay Bay Resort. Pool was exceptional for my young teens. Overall the resort provided all the amenities for a great vacation. We’ll definitely stay there again.
10,The bathroom in my room was disgusting when I checked in and due to the amount of time it took to check in and the time I was on hold I ended up cleaning it myself with Lysol Wipes. Housekeeping left my door propped open for who knows how long before I came back up to realize my room had been left open potentially all day. Luckily as it was a work trip I had all my valuables with me in the meetings I was in but as a single female traveler it was very scary to come back and have the room be open and have NO IDEA who had been inside at any point after housekeeping did it.
40,The hotel is down at the end of the strip the food choices are not the best. the table limits are 15- 25. The rooms are nice and clean. The pool is great however it closes at 7 pm there are other hotels that might be a little better for families. but it was a good trip in all
50,This was just a dinner stop on a flight layover and we ended up at Lupo which is from Wolfgang puck it was amazingly good. We had the main scallops and they were perfectly cooked with mushrooms and we had a couple of salads that were also excellent. We’ve been on a trip with eating out a lot in fairly expensive restaurants and this one was actually the best! Then we enjoyed wandering around looking at the slot machines and other restaurants.
30,We recently stayed with a large group of people for a wedding. The hotel is beautiful and clean however here are some things that we didn't like...  Nothing is convenient nor reasonably priced.  The food court/restaurants are very overpriced compared to other places further down the strip.  There is absolutely no shade at the pool unless you rent an umbrella or cabana.  The hotel is so large that everything is a long walk and very hard to navigate.  They take $100 a day for security deposit which we were not aware of.  The room is nice. The bed comfortable but the shower is very small.  Our room was facing the airport. If id known I would have requested something facing the strip or pools.  Definitely get an actual key card as phones don't work in the elevator.  Uber/Taxi is about $30 to the strip. We bought a 3 day Deuce bus pass which was great!    Things that we did that we really liked...  Freemont Street- the zipline was amazing  Venetian- Gondola ride and dinner at Trattoria Reggiano (reasonably priced and delicious)  The Candy Martini Bar- very good martinis and the promenade that it's located in is cool  Bellagio- Fountains  Mirage- Volcano  New York New York- cool to see  Luxor- cool to see    We were Vegas 1st timers and it was definitely an experience!
50,This hotel has really amazing views of the strip and its pools! The casino is clean and fun to be in. Plus the restaurants offer plenty of good options in house! The associates at the concierge are quick help and get you set up with tickets/shows and clever ways to spice up a trip
10,Felt very closed in and depressing. Hard to find any daylight or fresh food. Not human friendly. The hotel and casino are an endless maze that is very disorienting and noisy. Not my idea of fun at all. Feels out of touch with what people want and humans need.
50,We had a great stay loved the property and pools and shops and the connection between hotels. The rooms were clean and staff was great. Thanks for an amazing stay we will  Definitely be back. The only problem was the pools only stayed open until 7pm
50,I went with my parents and siblings and we had an awesome time. We always stay here when we visit vegas and the staff is always incredible. I have never met someone with a negative energy ever at the mandalay bay!
40,Our special birthday visit to Vegas was spectacular and our stay at Mandalay Bay made it special. We had a beautiful room and friendly service (except the bellman was a sourpuss!) The only glitch was an awkward checkout and an insane wait for luggage assistance at our departure. Jockeying all our stuff to the lobby by ourselves was NOT fun! But overall we'd stay there again and hopefully it will be better.
30,Mandalay Bay charges for everything! I was expecting to get charged for pool towels. There is very little shade in the pool area and an umbrella and two chairs was $450!!!! The casino hotel and pool area is fine. I won’t stay there again due to poor value for the dollar.
50,Casino rooms are clean. There is many places to eat drink dance lounge and the casino also has the Reef which is an nice aquarium with many types of sea life that you can explore. V.I.P check in could do a better job assisting the guests with check in.
10,The $18 charge for a bottle of in-room water and $50 for using the minifridge to store food was bad enough... But when I became sick with a stomach bug they actually charged $20 plus gratuity for 8 oz of ginger ale and a few packs of crackers!! I later learned the pool had high levels of bacteria/E-coli just prior to our arrival. That is probably how I wound up sick for 5 days. Never again!
20,The reason why we chose Mandalay was the pools. The surroundings of the lazy river were constantly full of plastic cups & empty cans. No server care to pick them up. The same for the other pools and sand area by the wave pool.  On our first day one of the lifeguards was falling asleep. I let another lifeguard know he didn't seem to care.  We ask the bell desk to come a retrieve our luggage from our room till we were ready to leave. No one told us that we needed to wait in the room in order for the luggage to be taken down to storage. We had interaction with 2 different people and none of them let us know the crucial part of waiting in the room. Instead they made us go all the way up to the room and wait for a bellman that lecture us on how you need to be in the room in order to get your luggage retrieve. Again it would have been nice if someone told us OR better yet offer to go get the luggage for the inconvenience. No no one apologized. I worked in Hospitality for 10+ years and this type of service is unacceptable. At least show you care.
50,Stayed for 4 nights at Mandalay Bay. Room was clean bed was comfortable and view of the pool was an added bonus. Large sunken tub in bathroom sealed the deal. Soaking in a hot bath is luxurious. Stay there without hesitation.
50,The rooms were very clean and fresh! It was a lovely hotel with a great pool area with several different types of pools and a free tram from the hotel to other hotels. Kind front desk staff and room service at late hours.
40,Everyone was amazing from check in to check out. Great pool but they could really use some more shade options. Can’t wait to go again. Lupo had amazing food and amazing service. The tram made traveling to other casinos super convenient and fun for the kids.
50,If you are coming with more than one person in your room this is where you need to stay. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is amazing. The only issue is that it is at one end of the strip - so you will need comfortable shoes!
40,We got a heck of a deal on our family stay. The kids loved the pool. We ate great food and really enjoyed it. Some of the restaurants are priced a little high for kids but the adults will enjoy everything. I do wish had had more to do for kids other than just the pool area.
50,First time staying at this hotel and I have to say I was very impressed. We went with kids and we all absolutely LOVED the pools. I like how it was clean and even though you could smoke in the casino floor the smell wasn’t overwhelming. It was nicely ventilated and cool for our stay. I like how mostly everything was easy walking distance. We stayed at another hotel previously and it felt like it took FOREVER just to get to our room. The tram helped out a lot especially with kids. We will definitely be back!
50,Make sure you tell the concierge you need a fridge to keep your medicine cold or else you won’t have any place to store leftovers or beer in the room without paying a $35/day up charge for a fridge.. also the bathroom doors didn’t close fully leaving a 1” gap for others to view me showering from the room. Aside from these minor complaints the room was extremely clean and modern very comfortable the casino/resort was the cleanest and most modern we saw on the strip and everything you could need is right there. Very well located on the strip and will definitely recommend or return to Mandalay Bay myself next time I’m in Vegas. Check out the aquarium it’s dope
10,I wished with all issues I had with my stay in this hotel as least the person in my checked out would offer me a complementary one day free at least to change my mind of bad experience I had staying for three nights.
50,We enjoyed our stay- our employees and their families had a blast.  Thank you Mandalay Bay!  Rooms were clean and well stocked- housekeeping was excellent.  The pools and the two bungalows we rented were perfect for our employees and their families to enjoy each others company. The food and beverages kept coming- the staff made sure we were never in need of something.
50,If you are looking for a resort that has a big variety with lots of class without being overpriced you have come to the right place! Restaurants concerts a pool complex that is fantastic you have it
20,Staffs were very friendly but the rooms and linens were so nasty. Will never stay here again. The wifi is not secured either. My throat hurts and scratchy when staying there but once leave this hotel I feel much better. We can see previous persons hair in bed shower and on the toilet
50,Love everything about Mandalay Bay Hotel. The check in person was amazing. The room was clean and also a great view. The pool was so fancy. The food was very good. Everything was perfect as I planned for my weeding day. It really exceed my expectations.
50,Had so much fun! Staff are so nice and welcoming even early morning. The only one problem we encounter is TV not working in the room till we left- stayed for 6 days. But overall - me and my daughter loves the place and will be back again.
30,I stayed here for a wedding. The hotel room was a little dusty. My allergies went rampant and only when I was outside of the room I felt better. The mattress was saggy as soon as I sat on the bed I could feel the foundation. I was disappointed usually hotel mattresses are always comfortable. The amenities as far as shopping and restaurants were average nothing unique. It was just an average experience.
30,Super packed with families kids strollers and rolling coolers. More like Disney than a Vegas hotel. Pool unusable unless you like swimming with 100 people blow up tubes and screaming children. Not my idea of an adult getaway will choose somewhere else next time.
50,We had a long weekend girls' trip and Mandalay Bay was our perfect Vegas get away. We loved spending time by the pool. The food was great especially breakfast at the gorgeous Sea Breeze restaurant. Oh they have a bottomless mimosa too! Citizens' has an amazing french dip and fries...and red velvet cupcakes. The casino was lively and not really smokey which I was worried about. We even won money on the slots. Lastly we spent time in the hot tibs at the spa and agrred we had really good massages. It was a wonderful trip!
10,For the price I paid for a conference suit / they featured all these large tv screens wet bar and mini bar .. nothing worked for my entire trip . Checked in and there was trash from the previous guest in the fridge . Horrible experience
40,We had a relaxing fun stay at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. This is our first time staying here. The large wave pool with its sandy beach like area is really impressive. It is super clean everywhere good service pool side service luxurious decor and friendly staff. Only strange thing we found that they are charging the coffee (K-cups) at a high cost.
30,Resort fee. Parking fee. Outrageous cost of food. ($43 for a pizza in the food court? Seriously?!?) Food court closes at 8pm. No refrigerator in the room unless you want to rent one for a crazy fee. One or maybe two blackjack tables open during the day with a $25 minimum every time I checked. On the positive side the rooms are clean and spacious and the pool is great (although crowded). Also checking in and using the app was convenient.
10,Mandalay sucks. Everything closed at 8pm  Noodle house sucked keys didn’t work  Room was hot  Tv didn’t work  Keys to elevator didn’t work  Digital key didn’t work  Only good thing was Stromboli in the food court
50,Everyone was very helpful and cheerful! The trip was very relaxing and fun.The pools we're very cool. The food was delicious and the service was very fast. Overall very satisfied with the whole trip  Wonderful
10,Rooms: Dirty rooms- think wadded up hand towels left by the precious guest in the closet. A half eaten bacon sandwich left in the mini fridge.  The grounds: overcrowded filthy pool and lazy river. Extremely short staffed.    Casino is limited- not a big selection of slot games. And not a winner in site.
30,Tv didn’t work in the room and I was charged for mini bar items I didn’t purchase. The poop was quite nice though and the location on the strip is good. Probably won’t go back and will choose another property for our next family trip.
50,We stayed at the Mandalay Bay for our anniversary. The room was beyond what I expected. Spacious clean and bed was super comfortable. Staff always smiling and greeting you. For my experience I would definitely stay here again.
30,Beautiful Hotel but the best times are behind it. Not really well maintained. Windows super dirty looks like the housekeeping had not enough cloths. AC loud and the Doors felt sticky. Not nice at covid times.    Parking is 15$ a night but you can park with that in every MGM Hotel for free.    Water bottle in hotel store was 8$ for a 12 oz ?!?!    I take the net time another hotel.
10,Rooms were dirty one was so disgusting with dog hair everywhere had to take pictures as proof to show front desk to get it cleaned. Couldn’t check out their system was down was assured they would check us out and email us that never happened thankfully we still had time after we landed. This was my first stay here and last not to mention kids running around everywhere as an adult with none not what I want to deal with.
50,Great location with many restaurants stores casino areas and bars. I was there for work so I spent most of my day in the convention center but there were many families staying there too using the amazing pool. Everyone (from employee to guests) were always smiling. Great experience staying here.
50,Last minute trip - decided to try Mandalay which we do not usually patronize but were pleasantly surprised by room quality cleanliness customer service and food. Hotel & city were not extremely busy or crowded during our stay and we enjoyed the friendly staff and were taken care of. Highly recommend Kumi (ended up eating there twice - bread pudding out of this world).
50,Mandalay Bay treated us well! You could stay and never have to leave during your trip here in Vegas. Great penthouse sky view suite. VIP lounge upgrade is a must!! Coffee and beer during your stay included. Pools are awesome!
50,Since I was a kid I've always loved Mandalay Bay now I get to bring my kids here and recreate those memories of my childhood the pool is the best the rooms are gold standard thank you to Kristof at the front desk for helping us out so much!
30,Our hotel room had no water pressure for extended periods of time during our stay. Hotel guess services was of no help after waiting on phone for 15 minutes.  Evening before our check out room had no water at all. Many better options on ten strip with far better value.
20,We stayed here because it was less expensive so we ultimately got what we paid for. We felt nickeled and dined throughout the trip. There was no free coffee or refrigerator in the room which even the Motel 6 offers. We had to wait a very long time checking in only to be put in incorrect rooms having to wait again and then having to move. The lazy river and wave pool were nice but the stark tunnel shown on their website costs an additional $30 per person. I wouldn’t stay here again. It’s also all the way at one end of the strip. I think I’d prefer to pay a little more and be centrally located.
10,My daughter and her friends were walking around hotels at 7pm and 4 grown men try to touch one of them and follow them to harass them. There were no security in sight for them for awhile. They did get pictures of them and video but hotel security didn’t catch them.
10,Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino was a big disappointment. We traveled with the kids and to guarantee adjoining rooms we were made us upgrade to stay well room. When we checked in we had to wait till 5:30pm to get our room for our kids and they were not connected nor close. Not sure why they made us wait all day then and make us upgrade (most likely just typical scam to get more money). Also I was invited VIP guest offered by VIP marketing 3 comp nights and food credit which I did not get. I got 1 free night only and no food credit yet I paid 2x the price b/c I upgraded to be next to the kids and wasn't. Complete scam.  Serice was awful with front desk or VIP. VIP Hosts had zero interest in helping and after playing $175-200 avg in the casino they did not want to comp anything (said I did not gamble enough yet all the tables I played majority was playing 50% less then I was at min).  Lupe was the only good restaurant with good service and food. No buffet which for Las Vegas was shocking and let down to the kids.    I would not stay at Mandalay Bay again even if you gave me a free room since I would have to end up paying 2x the normal price on a standard room.
50,We went there for the Lazy River pool...were not disappointed. Citizens also had a wonderful prime rib dinner. Elite King rooms is spacious. Pool cabanas were out of our budget...but you can easily find seats...just get there early. Would like to see more cocktail servers when gambling.
50,Great experience from the moment I arrived to the when I left. Besides leaving very happy with the resort I also left with $90.00 from your casino. I guess a great stay overall and will definitely return soon.
50,Family felt secure and loved every one there is verry professionally trained a d trustworthy.  I treayed my family to the Michael Jackson show and asked a member if he could tell us where the show was and he walked us all the way to the entrance sorry i didnt get his name
10,"Mandalay Bay used to be one of my favorite Vegas hotels - largely due to the fact my dad took my family here when I graduated college. And what made it fun is that it was the first year it opened. The casino itself along with the pool were good experiences. I’ve been to Vegas several times and stayed at other hotels however I always went to Mandalay for a dinner or a brunch.    Fast forward to 2022 I just returned after taking my wife and 3 kids. We were there from June 14 to June 17th. What was most disappointing were 3 main areas: 1) The overpriced nickel-and-dime tactics 2) the bad pool experience and 3) the rude and aloof staff.    The ridiculous list of fees mirrors what a terrible cable company does. It’s clear they want recoup $ from COVID. Here's a clue to MGM - it's all about user experience. No one wants to feel like everywhere they turn there's a fee. ""Oh you walked in the room with your right foot first that's $5 extra…per person."" “You took 4 breaths of air in the elevator? That’s $5 per exhale.” That’s the vibe of Mandalay. That is not a way to sustain customer loyalty.    Let's talk about the pool - the pool is essentially useless given the $50 per person fee for a chair with umbrellas. They only put umbrella-accommodating chairs in the first row. I mean it's only 100+ degrees outside. Mandalay refuses to put out umbrellas (probably because their super smart staff couldn't open one) for the vast part of the wave pool area (again unless you want to pay $50 per chair). One would think the exorbitant resort fee would give some options for umbrella use. They should be standard for all areas of the pool. What they fail to recognize is when the heat bears down on the majority of patrons it forces hotel guests to leave the pool after a few hours. They have this vast space that goes unused because it's not practical for a day-long experience. People will order more food and drink more alcohol if you make the pool experience better. Cheap arrogant and foolish of them to manage the pool this way. Furthermore there are NO signs about the $50 per chair fee anywhere. I walked up to a first row chair my first day (unknowing about the fee) and suddenly here comes some Thunder Down Under reject giving me the ""cutthroat"" sign. As he approached me he rudely said ""$50 per chair!"" Maybe when he realizes he doesn't have a real job he'll learn some f'ing manners. He was completely rude and out of line. I didn't come to LV to get treated like that.    What was downright awful was when I witnessed a woman who was very fair in skin tone open a small rain umbrella of her own while reading a book. She was sitting in the sun-drenched area not bothering anyone. No one was sitting next to her. Her umbrella was small modest. But of course he comes some overhyped staff member who rudely said to her ""you can't use your umbrella here!"". She quietly lowered it and moved to a small spot where there were a few minutes left of natural shade. I mean this lady already paying the overpriced resort fee just got spoken to as if she wasn't a guest. Again user experience.    Also they put so many chairs next to each other you can't move in between them. It’s not accommodating not practical. It looks like a solar panel farm.    Let's talk about the casino. The roulette staff was aloof with zero personalities abound. In a word - rude - they seemed put off if you asked them to put chips on a number for you. Did I mention user experience? The casino is essentially a square room - no style no contrasting levels of architecture. Pretty boring aesthetics.    And finally the refrigerator in your room. Be careful if you put your own water bottle in or if you’re a mother needing to chill milk for an infant. They'll charge you $50 if you do. Don't use the fridge unless you use what's already in there. Waste of space waste of resources.    If I had to sum up the brand of this hotel: overpriced with a douche bag crowd. It’s not a family place not a people place. No personality no endearing qualities. Zero heart zero soul.    The best part of the hotel experience is when I checked out. This was my 13th time to Vegas and honestly the worst experience of all. I've stayed at Bellagio Wynn TI Paris Mirage Aria stayed with a friend at Cosmopolitan back in 2017. All very nice. Also stayed at Trump Tower and Circus Circus. Even those were a better experience than Mandalay.    I look forward to coming back to LV but will never stay at Mandalay Bay again."
30,Stayed here because of the pools. We brought our kids. Rooms are small and expensive compared to other quality hotels on the Strip. They charge you for everything. Pool floats are $30 each. Parking $15 per day. Other hotels do not charge you if you stay there. You have to pay for the gym too. On top of the respite fee…
50,Lovely rooms friendly staff beautifully themed hotel. Best pool in Vegas with artificial waves every 90 seconds (body surfing!). My only objection is the tendency to make up random prices for chairs/umbrellas close to the water... I heard the price go up and down half a dozen times in the course of half an hour. Still if you’re okay with $350 for 2 chaise lounges and an umbrella it’s a fabulous place to stay.
40,Buy your inflatable swim tubes ahead of time for $4 at your local store BEFORE coming to the hotel… otherwise to use their lazy river you will need to buy a swim tube for $30!  Swim areas way too crowded:(
50,Absolutely gorgeous hotel; everything was super clean the bedrooms fantastic the views from the room were outstanding and the staff were all super friendly and helpful. The pool area was absolutely perfect-amazingly clean beautiful pools and tasty cocktails (frozen daiquiri!). The only thing I’d change is having more parasols as it’s crazy hot and you need some shade.
50,Brought my family to Vegas for a week. Mandalay Bay was in better condition than I can ever remember seeing it. Staff was helpful and friendly. Our elite king room was spacious and well appointed. Mobile check in check out and parking garage access makes coming and going a breeze.    We dined on property at Libertine Social which was exceptional even meeting several dietary restrictions in our pastry. We also reserved a cabana and had an amazing pool day. Cabana check in was efficient and service was regular and quick.    My only minor complaint is with the mgm rewards program. Partly my own fault but it was unclear to me how to access free play and comps. And like most casinos the rewards has merged with the cashier cage (smart on their end) but making the lines endless and discouraging. At one pointI waited half an hour only to run out of time and have to leave for a family obligation.    Overall a great trip and pending resolution of the mgm rewards we will be back very soon.
30,"The establishment was almost too big. Took forever to get anywhere. Out of eight elevators for our specific floors only two were functioning properly over a holiday weekend. The pools are a joke. Water was freezing. No kids area except a shallow spot near the ""wave pool"". The wave pool is just another pool with a small waver every few minutes."
50,My family and I had a lot of fun! We had no problems whatsoever. Any questions we had they were answered. My family had so much a great time we will definitely be coming back very soon. Check out was very easy too!
40,Great stay until day before the tv went out and maintenance could not repair and they couldn’t do anything for resolution. But overall check in the pool and food was good. Also thought casino would have more tables and no poker room games.
30,Dirty room on check in and a broken room phone. I had to clean my own room with disenfectant wipes. Waste baskets had trash on check-in and toiletries were opened and used. The property itself is nice but I wish cleanliness was held in higher regard.
50,My stay at Mandalay Bay was very pleasant. I'll have to give kudos to my housekeeper Brenda! She is amazing not only kept my room clean and organized but also always stocked up enough clean towels for me. Because of my allergy I had to use lots of facial tissues. She always kept an extra box of tissues there. I really appreciated it!    The bedding is super soft and comfy! After a full day of conference classes that soft bed is exactly what I needed!    If there were more options for dining that would be even better!
50,The rooms here are great nice sized with large bathrooms double closets and well decorated. Guest Service and housekeeping are friendly and courteous. There are many restaurants and attractions to visit during your stay.
50,The Mandalay Bay has so much to offer I didn’t even leave the hotel for my 2 night stay. There’s so much to do and be apart of. All the staff who helped check me in were amazing the Casino was lit too! You will not be disappointed staying here
50,What a great place to stay. The service was great and the staff friendly. Our room was clean and smelled good. The bed was comfortable I had a great night's sleep. The only downside was our room faced the pool area and at night they had some sort of night club and you could hear the bass of the music coming through the windows.    The pool area was great they have a wave pool lazy river jacuzzi and a pool. My daughter loved the lazy river even though the water was cold. One note they don't offer innertubes for the lazy river and it costs $30 to buy one there. The pool area is open from 8am - 7pm which is nice.    They do have a nice selection of restaurants however most are aimed for adults most did not offer a children's menu.    They have a free tram that will take to Luxor and Excalibur hotels.
40,Some front desk staff aren’t that friendly not wearing a welcoming smile. The room that we had has a good view overlooking the resort. However when we requested for towels in our 2nd night we didn’t receive any. 😔
30,I really do love Mandala Bay but MGM has gotten cheap over time the MGM phone App is buggy I did not feel safe and secure in my room this visit no good hot coffee before 6:00 AM the $12.00 a cup in the room is ridiculous registers down at the coffee bar and they would not hand out drip coffee to a waiting line (come on MGM you can do better) I did not get a closing statement for my room stay so now I need to call the hotel (it should be automatic this is the second time I have had to call)
50,Excellent customer service from every staff member. The rooms are spacious clean and comfortable! The pools were wonderful except for the wave pool. It was lame with one wave every five minutes and the life guards constantly blowing whistles to keep people in a small lined area when the pool is ginormous but you can’t swim in it.
50,The mandalay beach environment was a great experience followed by the shark reef and a welcoming atmosphere. Guests services were extremely helpful especially valet services. Spent 3 days during the week would love to do it again.
50,So I can’t say much about the hotel room- but staff was super nice -‘it was pretty. Pool was awesome!  While walking through the lobby you could still smell some cigarette smoke but it wasn’t horrible because they have a great filtration system and it smelled like vanilla!!!  We went to Shark Reef Aquarium and fed Sea Turtles! Staff there was awesome too!! If I ever go back to Vegas-‘that is where I will stay!!
40,Nice resort rooms and friendly staff but don’t use the in room coffee (that is complementary at any other hotel) unless you want a $12 charge per cup. Tacky move for a upscale place. Go down in the mall and grab a Starbucks for half the price.
30,If you are looking for family friendly this is the place for you! I’ve been to Vegas countless times. During different times of the year. This is the first (and last time) staying at Mandalay Bay. Kids screaming in room next to us for 3 nights. Kids screaming down the hall in the elevators. Forget enjoying the pool. Just don’t even bother. There were even kids propped up against casino walls while their parents gambled. It was insane. I genuinely couldn’t tell if I was in Disney World or Las Vegas. The actual room was very nice just don’t intend on getting much sleep or quiet time. If kids are for you this is your place. If you want a more relaxing experience (sans screaming children) DO NOT stay here.
40,We had a quick check in and great experience at the pool. It was awesome and the staff was flexible with my mistake on booking the lounge chair. Lots of eye candy around so the view was nice! Uber pick up drop of location wasn’t to far from the elevators
50,Im always anxious when it comes to check-ins and ive never felt more at ease… This has been my best experience so far and ive been coming to vegas for about 10 years…I will look no further in the near future for my sin city stays… The Bay is the place to be.
40,Getting charged 2x for parking was irritating. A bunch of slobs at the pools who couldn’t pick up their own trash. Tran information would have been appreciated.  Otherwise it was a great trip! I would book again.
40,The wave pool and lazy river were great. Sure the waves came along once every minute and probably for safety reasons. If you want more waves go to an actual beach. Definitely bring your own inner tube as they charge $30 to buy one onsite (no rentals). The room is nice and clean housekeeping service is top notch but the shower felt like a phone booth. The casino games were pricier but it's expected for a nicer hotel and casino. If you want to play $5 blackjack go off the strip or in downtown.
50,Hotel was excellent staff is awesome rooms are spectacular hotel waitstaff was nice and friendly! We ate at most of the restaurants on the resort and the food was delicious and all very very clean. Customer service was A++ My birthday weekend was special! Oh and room service was quick and great for our last night meals
10,I tipped the front desk $50 and got nothing in return. My cousin checked in 5 minutes after and got the same room. DONT ever tip the front desk at Mandalay!!! I tipped $20 at Paris and got upgraded to a suite…go to Total Rewards hotels to try to get an upstairs room
50,My only real complaint l I wished the resort fees were included at the time of booking. While using the digital key the only problem with that was accessing the elevator at times but over all very manageable. The pillows were a little soft for my comfort.
50,It was a very nice casino / hotel to stay in. Very nice servers and staff. Can’ wait to return and enjoy the great food slots room and A+ service. I really enjoyed all of the new things to do there this time around. Pool and cabana was great as well.
50,This is my number one choice for my next Summer’s Vegas trip. Great pools and lazy river. Top notch.cabana service. Clean rooms quick response from Housekeeping for more towels and easy contactless check in and check out.
20,Don’t bother with this casino. The wave 🌊 pool is not worth it it’s extremely packed and the life guards are rude and treat you like cattle 🐄 . Everything is expensive and overpriced. I went to Vegas too feel relaxed and special and I felt cheap.
50,Friendly staff friendly bartenders and the dealers are friendly even when they are taking your money! The restaurants were good! I wish they had a little more shops. The pool was awesome the wave pool was awesome! Wish the lazy river went farther around the pool area but still nice!
40,We had a great overnight stay at Mandalay Bay. Our room was excellent! Good size with great beds & bath and everything was clean. The only downside was the $40 charge for the roll away bed and it is not in the center of the strip (which might be an upside for others). Overall we had a very nice stay.
20,Not going to stay there again. If they really want me to write 200 characters this review will only go downhill from here so I think I will just leave it as hot loud expensive resort fee for nothing $20 for a bottle of water?!?! $50 to use the fridge WTH If you don't know that feeling you are being ripped off in Vegas you will after you stay here.
40,Michael A and Ben (Server from the restaurant Kumi) were the highlights of my trip!!!  Without Michael’s assistance I would of checked out and never come back. Make sure to ask for Ben from Kumi when you do arrive.  Sushi is amazing and Ben’s service was absolutely amazing
10,First time in Vegas and not will come back there was mayhem in the pool area food was bad and staff was not friendly finding the self park was a hassle so make sure you google it before YouTube worked but I think they can do better.
50,Stayed for a week. Great room - very clean and in good shape. Short to no wait time for the elevators. Zero issues with anything. The only thing I would have liked is for the gym to have stayed open later for people like myself who were working during the day.
10,When we arrived our bed was messily made with no fitted sheet. Just loose sheets on exposed mattress. The TV didn’t work. I called front desk and they said someone would come help. Finally hours later after 9pm someone came & luckily we were still there. Upon checkout the bell desk said it was a 45 min wait so we instead carried bags. When we got to valet there was plenty of rolling bag carriers & no bell boys to be seen. Then we paid the $30 for valet & waited nearly 30 min for our car outside. We should have self parked or just stayed elsewhere. We stayed Mon-Tues. I can’t imagine how awful service is on weekends. Not being able to use the fridge for our own snacks or even have umbrellas for free at the beach are terrible policies. I grew up staying here regularly on family business trips & will be sure to tell my family this place is no longer the place to stay.  Oh and we even tried to go to Citizen for dinner. It was 9:40 and they looked at though they were closing. We went to the takeout section and I asked what time they closed. She said 11pm. It also says 11 on the Mandalay Bay website! I asked a man closing up if we could go to the bar atleast and he said yes & let us through. Then the hostess chased up down and tried to kick us out & said they were closing. It was 9:40 pm. Not 11. Not even 10. I told her the man just said we could get drinks. She went and consulted with him and never got back to us. So we sat confused at the bar whether we were allowed to be there. The bartender was happy to serve us drinks.
50,While on the south end of the strip this resort offers all the amenities to keep you busy during your stay.. fine dining shows attractions shopping pool/spa and gambling. While we do venture to mostly other MGM Properties during our stay there is enough doing on at this resort to keep you captive.
40,We had several problems with our stay at Mandalay Bay. Upon entering the room it did not appear to be vacuumed. The bathroom toilet seat had pee on it. The shower had brown gunk on the tile. The tv did not work and when it did it froze. The ice machine did not produce ice.  The facilities person was Medrano. He was very helpful in fixing the tv and ice maker. He also explained that all of the tvs were on wifi and that they were upgrading to fiber to fix the freezing problem.
50,Such a sweet place to stay but the people were even sweeter first We want to say We would have to write a Book on our whole experience at Mandalay Bay! Dante Hennessey Janet Kelley and the rest of the staff are the best!!!reserved the VIP package in October 2021 for a reasonable price before any increase in February.We were made to you feel like Rockstars at any price and I would pay any price to experience that again(well almost 😊) entire staff at Mandalay Bay are to be commended for making our 35th wedding anniversary so special despite the airlines and a few other self-inflicted hiccups 😉thank you thank you thank you! We will be back
40,Walkability was an issue bit too far off strip  but very nice rooms comfortable. Had an issue with unclean sheets and they fixed it right away. Elevators were temporarily broken but fixed quickly we took the service elevator in the meantime
30,Poor quality drinks especially for what you pay.  We only experienced the poor drink quality at Rhythm and Riffs where we wathed them add water to a Vodka Redbull and kaluha and Cream. We confronted the waitress over this as the bartender was too busy. She said we were mistaken. Another waitress recommended that we get our drinks from one of the other bars and bring them in.  The waitstaff was pretty good and the music was excellent.  But again the drinks were overpriced particularly for the quality.
10,The mobile app for check-in and self-parking did not do the job :-( Worse room ever once changed (after 30+ minutes queueing in the lobby) the room was better but showing its age.  Everything else (self parking coffee in the room - 12 USD !) is overpriced.  Housekeeping was simply often not done we had to complain several times at 5 PM to clean up the room....
40,Great hotel. Felt like I was sleeping on marshmallows. Clean room and bed. Hallway a bit noisy! Room key only works on your floor and reduced extra guest experience.made it hard for visitors. Otherwise all was well.
10,There was no fridge no microwave in the room. Complimentary coffee or tea were not available in the room. Market place at the main floor had very limited merchandise. Hotel was very crowded. Pool water was cold yet 30+ C weather.
50,The casino was nice and clean all of the staff was helpful. Hotel rooms were nice and clean room service was quick staff was nice. Definitely go to the adult only pool much better there than with all the kiddos in the other pools
40,It’s an extremely nice hotel with all the features well suited for families . It’s away from the busy area of the strip and that helps a lot . However the room mini bar needs to be avoided as it’s extremely expensive
50,Took my son to Vegas to celebrate his senior trip….just like I did 20 years ago. I love this hotel. I normally stay here for my yearly girls trip so I knew he would love the pool area and the rooms and of course the restaurants
50,They were very attentive from start to finish. Someone was always around to answer questions. The pool area was excellent. Can’t say enough about our experience but all should go and try it out. You won’t be disappointed
50,Amazing atmosphere and beautiful venue - wonderful food choices convenient location and transportation services and well-appointed rooms - super kind staff...a five star stay. I would recommend Mandalay Bay to anyone and look forward to our next visit.
50,If you want to be treated like a VIP and you are a veteran I highly recommend applying for the MGM Life program at the Mandalay Bay. My stay there this weekend was extraordinary! The amount of service and respect the staff give to veterans at Mandalay Bay was almost embarrassing...but they certainly give you the star treatment. It was my first stay there...I will definitely be going back!
20,Hotel room is of good size however guest will not find anything in room not even water. Things kept there in room are damn expensive. like a water bottle cost is 22$. Laundry bag will not be kept every day. Guest has to call and ask for that. For Laundry pick guest has to call bill desk.
50,Had a great stay - hotel exceptionally clean bright and many activities for whole family. First stay but definitely not the last. It is at the far end of the strip but with the tram it is easy to be at New York New York within minutes and then north on the strip quickly.
30,Excellent value for what I paid. Service was good and room was clean. However rooms and hotel overall felt a bit dated. Location at the end of the strip not ideal. Although definitely better location than staying off the strip entirely.
50,The Mandalay Bay offered plenty of space for our 16000 guest conference while providing good food quality with great service. The rooms and beds were spacious and comfortable. When my flight was canceled I was able to stay another night at an affordable rate.
50,My family and I felt safe everyone was friendly and the hotel is clean. I wish the pool/beach area was updated and had more shading and also at least one fast food place like McDonald’s for the kids. Over all everything was amazing in general just wished house keeper came early since ours never came at all and we ran out of towels and needed our trash can emptied. Will definitely come back if I bring my children! Just minor stuff I had concerns with.
30,Lots of hidden charges including putting kids milk in the mini bar and not removing anything but the milk! Also despite being on the 22nd floor we couldn’t sleep through the music which was louder than any concert I’ve ever been to!
50,Checking in was quick and easy. The hotel room was clean and well upkept. There are lots of things to do and see at the resort. The pools are amazing and they have several great dining options. We will definitely be back.
20,Room very dated had bugs and tv didn’t even work . Employees at border grill restaurant were not helpful (very bad service) no at the hotel offered to fix these issues let alone offer any kind of discount
50,Our favorite hotel to stay at. Best VIP services on the strip. The pool is one of the best especially for children. Great restaurants inside. No need to even leave the hotel. Will return very soon!!!
50,Had a wonderful stay at Mandalay - highly recommend for all ages families couples etc. The pools offer something for everyone and keep kids entertained all day. Great variety of food options and the casinos were awesome.
10,If you have a family don’t go to the Mandalay Bay. Your child may touch the water candy or anything in the fridge and you will get a nicely extra 100 charge on your room.  Getting two rooms at the same time does not work via the app. One room can get checked in while the other requires a “stay in line” trip to the lobby. Hotel progress has been replaced with “milking customer” attitude and slow delays everywhere.
30,Charging $26 for room service coffee and not providing any in the room. They have the machine in there but no pods. Those cost $12 a piece. They charge insane resort fees and provide very little for that. For crying out loud. Seriously. You can't provide coffee or some qtips?
50,This is my new Go TO place. Never had to leave the property for anything. The property had everything I needed on-site. Nice selection of restaurants and bars. Many stores for shopping. Pool and lazy river are great!
50,The hotel is great rooms are nice and large and the pools are great with a variety. We liked the restaurant options and tram connecting some of the MGM hotels together to shorten the walk. Overall I'll be a regular at this hotel in the future!
50,As loyal MGM members we love the Mandalay as it has our favorite restaurants from Lupo to Stripsteak and even Citizens or Seabreeze for breakfast. Our only knock is how far down the strip it is but it’s Vegas you should probably get out an walk a little due to the copious amounts of food and booze we eat. We’ll be back!
30,"First of all I will say this is a great Las Vegas hotel and a great place to stay with family. However be aware that staying in one of the Panoramic two bedroom suites during the summer (+95 degrees outside) the bedrooms will never dip below 75 degrees. The AC intake and vent are located behind a giant column in the master bedroom and it just creates a vortex behind the column where it blows cold air directly into the column and cools the giant column in the corner of the room rather than actually cool the room. In the other bedroom the AC intake and vent are located in the far corner of the room and like the master never dips below 75 degrees. There is really nothing the hotel can do about it. When I asked for fans for the bedrooms I was told ""we don't have fans"". They did send a very nice engineer to adjust the vents but even he admitted that was the most they could do. 75 degrees wasn't completely unbearable but when staying in a place like Las Vegas or Palm Springs when it's very hot outside I need relief from the heat and typically that includes returning to a nice cool hotel room. Not a room where the air feels still and is 75 degrees."
50,Stayed here for Cisco Live 2022 and couldnt have been happier with the resort the cleanliness of the rooms and the friendly staff. Great place to stay while in Sin City! Would highly recommend to anyone traveling here for business or pleasure!
50,Came here for two days. I’m not much of a gambler so I can’t provide casino information. We scheduled two recreational tours and it was very easy getting picked up from the hotel. Room was very clean I hate they charge you to use the fridge. Ate at several restaurants and never had a bad meal. Especially loved Border Grill. Great experience overall!
30,I was accused of committing a crime while I was enjoying an evening out with friends at the Eye Candy Lounge on 6/11/22. About 10 fine police officers guarded the exits and escorted me to the entrance of the club to say that I fit the description of someone who was going through purses. I've been a fan of the hotel for years It might be the time to find a new place to stay while in Vegas with my friends and family
50,I stayed here during a very large tech conference on site and despite the thousands of guests staying there every aspect of the hotel was managed well and the staff couldn't have been more helpful and courteous. Rooms were clean the amenities were well maintained and fantastic plus we felt very safe during our stay.
50,Great family fun the shark reef aquarium was eye-popping and one of our fave experiences. The food options were affordable and the pools were very kid friendly. The one thing that was not top notch was that the bathroom smelled like pee…someone must have peed on the wallpaper and it wasn’t scrubbed out. Other than that great experience.
10,Mobile check in at 1:30pm. Room not available until 10:00pm. Was given food and beverage credit and Fleur cancelled my dinner reservation 30 minutes prior to reserved time due to private event. Hostesses didn’t seem to care.
30,Hotel room was nice. Spotty WiFi would leave you stranded the the elevator or standing outside your room if you couldn’t access your Bluetooth key. Absolutely NO water pressure in the shower. No fridge for personal use in the room; only stocked $12+ Gatorade and soda cans. Minimal hotel staff to assist. You had to phone someone offsite to assist!
50,Cannot say enough good things about this hotel friendly staff. Clean rooms. Great views. Great food. May other amenities and connected to other hotels so you never even need to leave! This place has it all!
10,We experienced an issue and was told by the front desk they would send someone to the room for repairs and they never came the repair wasn’t made and we stayed for 3 days. 3 days of having an issue being told they would fix it and they did not.
50,Loved the room. It was clean well stocked.The services. Desk extremely helpful in checking us in early. Staff was extremely helpful. Had lots of questions all staff extremely eager to help. Valet service exceptinal
50,Second time to stay at Mandalay Bay. Once again it was a wonderful experience for my wife and I. Truly enjoyed it and plan to return. The staff was friendly and informative. The Bell Desk brought our luggage to the room immediately.
40,The hotel is great. Everything is extremely overpriced though so be careful. The blow dryer is also outdated and sucked my hair up in the fan. 🥲 I do recommend this spot mostly for the pool experience and the hotel room itself.
10,The people who worked there were rude and prejudice and no help to me at all.  From the check in to leaving. I had a problem with being treated badly by staff members. And whenever I called to try to get a hold of a department they never answer I was to told the hotel higher ups would get a hold of me about a incident that involved a security officer that was being rude and treated me like I was criminal but I still have not gotten a call.  The we check out on Tuesday and ended up leave some stuff in the room when trying get back we get run around and the hotel manager was saying she see about calling housekeeping to see if they had but guess what they didn't have nor did security so my cards and cords are gone so I see that maids are dishonest because it should of been in the lost and found I lost 300 dollars in gift cards and 100 dollars in around 1 card plus the card to various casino and othere places. The manager took her time just to tell me there was nothing she can do I ask if I can take to someone over her she told they would say the same thing basically she denied me.there so much more I can say but I will end it hereof not it would be really long.
50,I normally stay at the JW Marriott in Vegas because I'm not a fan of smoky crowded casinos. Since my wife was traveling with me this time we booked Mandalay Bay for the pool. We got an Executive King room using a AAA member rate. It had a great view of the strip and airport. I was very pleased that the hotel and casino have a large/open feel - much better than the other strip properties. The pool was awesome.
50,This is my 2nd trip here. Loved it both times. Clean friendly lots of food to choose from and convenient to where we needed to be.    The room … awesome. Clean. Beautiful. Huge bathroom. Comfortable bed. Only negative was that it never got cool enough for us and not enough usb outlets. The outlets in the lamps by the bed were worn out and didn’t work. Only had 2 usb on the desk and when we each have phones and watches it’s not enough. Do NOT touch the waters/coffee cups/or fridge. Waters were $22 and I bumped a coffee cup with my bag and it automatically charged $14. You can get coffee and a pastry at Hazels for $11.    Food … loved the coffee and pastries at Hazels by the elevator. Sit down breakfast was definitely a hot at Citizens. Tacos and Margaritas were the best at Border Grill (Cadillac Marg was awesome). Food in the food court wasn’t as expensive and great for lunch.  We could find live music about every evening. The casino isn’t as lively as others but we enjoyed that.    The cardio center is mostly cardio machines. There are a few free weights but most of them are the big ones. There was 1 set of 10lb weights. The rest were 20+. It was very busy around 10am.    Pool/lazy river …fantastic. Bring your own float. They’re $30 here. There are air stations to fill them. There isn’t any shade. Water shoes are a good idea bc the concrete is so hot you can’t walk around. Everyone who enters must show a room key- no bringing a buddy.    Location… this was convenient for us because of the conference being located here. There is a free tram that will take you to luxor and Excalibur. From there you can get to mgm and nyny within a couple minutes. We traveled to all of them and could get to dinner at nyny in about 15 min. We didn’t mind the walk or travel to stay here. An Uber to bellagio cost us about $13 and we took a nice stroll back.    The only difference I noticed from our previous visit here is that there are more things in the hotel that are closed. The beach bar before you exit the hotel to walk to the pool was closed. The main gift shop in the lobby never opened. Some of the shops on the bottom level by the spa were never open.
50,It was a great stay the pool was fun. The concert I attended was in the casino which was really great. It was a pleasant stay for me and my family. We are satisfied with our stay there. We highly recommend
10,Title says it all. Worst shower of my life and they did nothing to fix it after I let them know. Just my resort fee🙄 Never sent maid to reclean room just a security guy. He was nice but did terrible job probably because it’s not what he signed up for. I don’t blame him I need a maid to actually clean
50,If I can rate higher than 5 I would. Everything was amazing during our stay. The casino was massive the pool felt great and the room was extremely modern and clean. I will be coming back the next trip to Vegas.
50,I loved this location. However I recommend room gets cleaned before check in. After I checked in I have seen left over food in the refrigerator. Apart from that everything is good. It was a nice trip.
30,It was all right. The front desk luggage assistance and room service was great. Though when we came to our hotel our cable wasn’t working so they came in about two hours fix the cable and for the inconvenience they offered us each $25 dining coupons. We were told we could use them at the pool we tried to and were still charged for the food with our cabana.
40,We have stayed in 80% of the MGM properties and this is our #4. 3rd in style 3rd in cleanliness and 5th in location. Only 24hr food is a subway in the convention center side and they were out of the basics.
20,Checkin staff rude and overworked. One of the main attractions the Moorea pool was not available due to a private function and that was not disclosed when booking. Room service couldn't get simple orders correct.
40,Mandalay is huge so some crowding to be expected. Staff works hard to please. Nice gaming room but tables can be high basic bet. I would gamble there all the time if stakes allowed nice rooms but some tiny problems. App is balky. Too bad as that could really be a godsend.
50,Great place to stay with lots of eateries drinks and opportunities to sight see. You can walk to 3 different hotels and casinos from here while staying inside. The service is wonderful and all of the staff were helpful and friendly.
50,Evey when this hotel is extremely large and very crowded waiting time in elevators restaurants room service and valet service was fast and efficient.  Food was excellent at Aureole the check in staff were friendly.
20,"I understand that this is Vegas... But this stay was over the top expensive even for Vegas standards. $50 if you even ""touch"" anything in the minibar much less try to put anything in there to keep it cool. Charging you for parking each day of your stay at ""their"" hotel. I've stayed at the Mandalay Bay many times but this will be the last time I ever stay there. The prices and add ons that you can do nothing about sealed the deal for me to never stay there again."
30,It is not as good as before. No electric car charging station support! Bed and food is ok. Valet parking sucks because we paid it in the overall bill and I could not validate the ticket at the kiosk. I ended up walking back to the front desk from the beach level and waited in the line.
30,Rooms need to be clean better. We had to request face towels everyday because the cleaning team never left any. They charge $50 a night if you want to use the refrigerator to store items. It's ok but
50,Great Hotel and poolsEasy access to get to hotel and from the freeway. Staff is always friendly and polite and hotel is always clean and smells clean including the bathrooms. The casino floor is easy to get around and not congested. Very close to upstairs mall and if you can try the Ice Bar lots of fun.
20,"We booked a king suite in April for a June trip for our anniversary and cancer fee celebration. Can you imagine how surprised we were when they say"" we don't have you room"". (Even our travel agent called to confirm before we left).  So we ended up in the Delano for the night on my dime which had an awful rock hard bed and we didn't sleep a wink. So the next morning I checked online and they had a room available. So back to the reception with all our cases.  We did like our room.  They also said they give $100 but it comes off the charges we put on to the room. However you have no way of knowing.  We had a good time but that's because of us and certainly not Mandalay Bay hotel or it's staff. I honestly feel we was robbed of time and money since I've no idea if they're playing you when they say $100 off a bill when they don't show you were it comes off  This is our second time in Vegas and could well be out last.oh and the food at the beach bar is really poor quality.  And the management do not care."
10,Broken faucets for the shower so I can’t take a shower - and had to wash my hair in the tub. I got 3 bottles of free water $30 resort fee waived and no apology at all. Worst customer service I have experienced. They just don’t care. Come at your own risk.
50,Checked in virtually via the app and was pleasantly surprised to be greeted by an upgraded room. What was originally supposed to be a standard King room but we were happily greeted by a Stay Well Executive King Suite as we opened the door. Only downside was the fact that we were only there for one night and didn't get a chance to enjoy it longer! Amazing stay.
10,When we arrived we were put in a room where the ac did not work. It was 3am and a technician was working on our ac. We were left in the room that night. When I let the guy at the front know it still wasn't working he stated they had been having many issues with the ac. In other words they knew it wasn't working. Next night we were moved to another room where the a/c was a little better. Two days later after check out I see a $140 charge on may card for 2 bottles of Bacardi from the mini bar. I call to dispute the charges as the fridge was never opened. The girl Sarah says that they will do an inventory check to see if it was from the previous guest. Why was this not done prior to them charging my card? Terrible service and the manager that day seem to care less that we had been stuck in a room with no a/c. Then the pool closes at 7pm so you can't even enjoy that in the evenings.
10,Beach club chicken Cesar salad and California rolls were worse than supermarket pick up. Complete with packaged salad dressing in plastic bowls and trays. You can get better at the supermarket and not pay $25.00 for the prepackaged food. Terrible.  No shade at the beach club. We paid for chairs with umbrellas that they couldn’t put up because of “wind”. And cost $90.00.
50,Went for a business trip with my wife. Had a great time and everything was great. Great pool area and restaurants. Casino was clean and had plenty of open tables. Would definitely stay there again in the future.
10,Housekeeping stole money from our room the last day we were. We had the do not disturb sign on the door. They went in anyway. The hotel has record of them going into the room and are doing nothing about it. Not giving us our money that was stolen. No credit for our stay was given. All they would do was file an incident report. Awful place.
10,By simply putting a few items in their room refrigerator I apparently set off some sensors that charged me $111.84 even though I didn't take anything out of their refrigerator. When I explained that I was charged mistakenly at check-out the personnel told me they would have to take an inventory before they could clear the charge. The charges were from days before & the room service could have easily seen that nothing was taken. Now after 5&1/2 days they still haven't reversed the charges that were in error.
10,The most horrible experience in Las Vegas ! Don't touch anything in this Hotel . You will pay for that . If do you want to stay here  place don't do it . We booked 3 rooms and they charged us for water and alcoholic drinks that we never drank . In the one room they charged more than 600 $  in the second room 230 $ . It is a scam ! And you need to spend hours to get your money back .
50,Checkin is always really time consuming here. We love the resort but could use a quicker checkin time. Pool service was great facility clean food is always expensive in these resorts. Can't review room cleaning service as we didn't ever get it which is fine too.
50,The hotel and staff are top notch. Rooms are high quality. Quiet and clean. Citizens Restaurant is great and have wonderful wait staff. The pools are fabulously. Resort style amenities. Everything a Vegas hotel should have.
10,The rooms smelled like pee two chairs and a umbrella were $300 at the pool. If you want a unpadded chair with no umbrella that’s free. They provide zero shade otherwise. The tubes for the lazy River are $35. The staff is more worried about being cool vs professional.
50,Mandalay is our favorite place to stay in Vegas! It has great restaurants but also a food court for an easy and cheap meals. We love the beach pool lazy river etc. Best relaxing pool vibes for sure. At night there was a DJ and live band where you could dance. Something for everyone!
50,Mandalay Bay’s rooms were very nice. We’ve stayed at Caesar’s Linq & The Flamingo and MB’s rooms were the nicest thus far.  The hotel is just far enough off the strip that there was no street noise at night for a soundless sleep. Location is a give and take so we did shuttle up and down the street instead of walking.  I would definitely stay here again!
40,Booked 2 rooms for a three night stay a couple of months in advance. Never got the requested adjoining rooms for our teenagers after numerous attempts. Pools food Casino & rooms were great otherwise.
50,Mandalay Bay Resort is a great place to host an convention I had a great experience at the Siemens Realize Live 2022 event the week of May 9 - 12 2022 I would highly recommend this venue for a meeting convention or pleasure it's got it all in one beautiful location.
50,I loved this resort. Staff was so helpful and friendly. I met a lady at the pool from North Utah and had moved to southern Utah after divorce. She was born raised in West INDIANAPOLIS.. my only regret I didn't get her number...
50,I love Mandalay Bay. This was the second time we’ve stayed there. Great atmosphere. There is a party vibe but it’s an adult party vibe. The pool was superb. I love the digital check in and digital keys.
50,Always a great place to go if you don’t want to visit the rest of the strip. It’s got a great pool and restaurants so there’s no need to leave. However if you do want to venture you’re right off the main drag.
50,This was my first time staying at Mandalay Bay and overall it was a nice stay. The staff was nice and accommodating. The hotel was easy to navigate. And it was convenient to everything on the strip. Will be back.
30,The room was clean and comfy. But the mini bar (the water and snack portion) is grossly overpriced. The only fridge in the room is full with mini bar and if you move anything it's charged. So no room fridge for you. They say it's convenient to download the app and check in which is but the digital room key isn't reliable in the elevators which we got stuck In Twice. Just ended up getting the plastic ones. The digital key requires you to have phone service or wifi which both cuts off in the elevators.  The bathroom is nice big soaking tub double sinks and a stand in shower. The lighting is horrible.. so all you ladies trying to slay for your vegas bash weekend... bring your lit mirrors. The toilet was closed off which was nice for privacy but there was no vent in that room and both of our rooms smelled like someone snuck in before us and blew it up. It was constant stink.. probably plumbing issues. When I made the reservations 7 months ago I used a 3rd party app but booked 2 rooms under 1 reservation. One of the main reasons I booked there was it advertised adjoining rooms. We celebrated a 21st birthday with 5 people. As soon as I made the reservation I called the M.B. and told them I had made the reservation and wanted to make sure it was adjoining. They said there is no guarantee but they will add the request to my reservation and call closer to the time of check in. I called again a month prior. Said same thing not a guarantee Even though it advertises that they have them. Called the day before and they said check in when you get here and we will see what they have.. I made the reservation 7 months ahead. Not 7 days. That's plenty of time to MAKE it available. We did end up getting rooms together but should not even have to deal with calling more than once for something that is advertised. They weren't discounted rooms they weren't booked on the fly... I think they can do better there. The casino floor was clean and there was a lot of food choices. The hazel coffee bar was our favorite place. Great drinks great bartender that served us and the musician was good.
10,Should’ve just paid a little more for Aria and saved a lot of money traveling and had a way better experience. It was hectic and staff was just standing around while they seen me struggling trying to check in. The room had a view of a wall and the rooms shower was dirty I wore my sandals in there. Room service sucked and was overpriced.
50,We had a great time Emily had amazing service and she helped us out every way she could. I come with allot of questions and allot of people get frustrated or avoid my questions. I love that she answered me openly and honestly. She helps Ed me have the trip I wanted.
40,Get the key card even if you check in on app. Elevators don’t work well with your phone.  Citizens restaurant well worth the money-great taste & large portions. Skip House of Blues for food.  Cheesecake at Wolfgang Puck’s is amazing!!
50,We really enjoy the beach and having all the amenities close by.  The entire staff is very helpful also.  Thank you all.  Thank you thank you thank you  This is all I’m going to say and this stupid review wants more.
30,We chose this hotel because of the wave pool and lazy river. I did find the hotel to be too expensive. For one we wanted to use the fridge to store items such as milk and not only did it not offer any space if you moved anything you would be charged a $50 service fee. There is daily resort feebut if you would like an Inter-tube for the lazy river they are $35. To enter the wave pool kids must be at least 48” so that’s important to note if you have small kids. Restaurants within the hotel are very pricey.
50,I had a great stay at Mandalay Bay. The rooms are very comfortable are a nice size & extremely quiet. I know people are rowdy & loud in Vegas but Mandalay Bay has done a great job of keeping the rooms insulated from all the noise.
50,The hotel is very clean and updated and staff is accommodating. The pool are is awesome and makes you feel safe and on a vacation. MGM Rewards program is a plus especially the extra for military or veterans.
50,A milestone birthday was celebrated at Mandalay Bay and did not disappoint. Dinner relaxing by the pool topped with complimentary drinks and game play and entertaining musicians were all part of a most memorable and enjoyable vacation!
10,We got fully unpacked and settled before we noticed that the room wasn’t cleaned at all. The shower had hair from a previous guest on the wall and the front desk didn’t care at all to properly address the issues. This issue was not resolved until the 4th it was addressed.
50,Visiting Mandalay Bay is like being on vacation from the Pools and Spas to the great restaurants we love the wave pool and Beach as well as the other beach resort areas and lazy river it's a great place to relax and unwind away from the hustle and bustle of the strip
20,Our stay was ruined by our friendly neighbors whose kid only knew how to scream during night. The responsible parents totally controlled their kid after I called security to shut them up. Then our door lock ran out of battery. Ive had better stays at cheaper hotels…
40,Only negative was how expensive the food and beverages were and there are no microwaves and mini-fridges. Rooms are average but no complaints for the price considering that it's Vegas. I could see my self staying at Mandalay Bay in the future however I would bring my own snacks and beverages.
50,We were able to upgrade to an executive king room that was better than expected. We had an amazing visit to Shark Reef Aquarium with a sea turtle feeding session that I can’t recommend highly enough. I would absolutely do it again. We also had a wonderful dinner at Fleur the wait staff was amazing and went to extra lengths to make sure our anniversary dinner was perfect. We’ve stayed at several properties in Vegas and this was one of favorites.
50,I had a redeye so I took an extra night here. The check in support to get me to my room was outstanding. The room was gorgeous with a view of the pool deck. I use the spa took a shower and headed to my flight. Great way to end my business trip
40,Good facilities and casino little pricy on inroom beverages great pool. Far end of the strip so not very close to anything but the tram helps. Food could’ve been better from the caterer but the restaurants were pretty decent.
50,"Just returned from a 3 night stay at Mandalay Bay. I almost switched hotels at the last minute for something more ""mid-strip"" but I'm glad I didn't. Yes it is at the far end but still within easy walking distance of several other southern-strip properties (with an assist from the free tram) and an easy Uber or Lyft ride anywhere else.    All staff members we encountered were very friendly and helpful. The interior of the hotel is beautiful and probably the best smelling of all the casinos we entered.    The room was nice and spacious with a great view of the strip. Very quiet as well. The bed was a little soft for my liking and I would have liked more (or any) lower priced food options but that's a minor quibble. All-in-all highly recommended and I would absolutely stay here again."
50,I stayed for a whole week and was very pleased with the service and cleanliness of the room! The towels were replaced each day and room was cleaned. The overall hotel is absolutely beautiful with so many places to eat!
50,"We were a little hesitant about going to a casino when the pandemic seemed to be at an end. After all the place is full of ""gamblers"" (lol).. We were pleasantly surprised at how ""normal"" the experience was. We had masks if we felt like wearing them but there were many times when we didn't. Of course the air circulation in the Mandalay Casino has always been and continues to be superb."
50,Beautiful property with updated rooms the room had good space with view facing the new Raiders football stadium. Love the pools. Easy access to I15 and the Vegas strip. Will definitely stay here again.
50,The strip steak was amazing! Chilean sea bass blew my mind. Rachel was an awseome server! Anna was so accomidating!The food and experience was over the top. It was the cherry on the cake for my birthday! Thank you to the whole staff. Compliments to our sommelier and chef! Later when we gamed in the floor the cocktail service was on point so personable and friendly! Coung was very sweet to make my friends players cards and explain how bets worked at the table. Overall great experience. I defiantly recommend stay at this resort casino. Thank you to who catered to my party!
40,The Stripsteak restaurant and check in experience was so good it made up for the $300 they wanted for each chair at the pool and each umbrella. ($1200 for 2 people to sit comfortably at their pool). Also we visited other pools every day and The Mandalay Bay pool was dirty chairs smashed together and uncomfortably overcrowded.    But the staff was wonderful. Without the pricing and raw tourist greed experience of the pool it would have been a 5 star experience because of the food and staff.
50,Very nice and clean confortable beds nice clean casino. Pools were clean and the service was great. My favorite was the beach pool. Restaurant were great. And the front desk clerk was pleasant very helpful
10,I reserved my room in April for a 2 queen with strip view and got a room with a view to the airport. When I complained they said all the rooms with a strip view were already taken. Why reserve your room if they are gonna give it to someone else.
50,Best hotel on the strip! Good food- House of Blues. Service. Fun. Pool was amazing. Stores are great. Very clean and easy check in. The Light nightclub is a great vibe and convenient having in the hotel!
40,This is one of the better properties on the Strip. Unfortunately management has decided not to fully staff the resort so some restaurants have shortened hours or number of tables available and some of the stores are flat closed. Also the previous standard of cleanliness has obviously slipped. Too bad.
50,Hotel and Casino is nice. The pool is amazing. We rented a Cabana and I highly recommend this for a day. This hotel also connects to the Luxor which makes it easy to visit their Casino attend shows or eat and shop in Luxor hotel as well. It is at the end of strip so you either walk alot take a cab or Uber further down the strip. Super close to the airport which is nice on your day of departure. We have stayed in this hotel 2 times and I would stay here again. It was really easy to find our friends in the hotel and meet up with our group. Elevators are in a great location as well. We had a group of 14 on this trip and we all stayed here.
50,The hotel staff and front desk services was very friendly helpful and provided great customer service. My hotel room was very comfortable clean and relaxing. The food ordered through room service was excellent!
40,1st time at Mandalay Bay. Stay was very nice. Contact less check in was a bit confusing once mobile app didn't work but staff was very helpful. Spent Saturday night at a bar in the casino and had a wonderful time dancing and talking to other guests. Great couples trip
50,Our breakfast restaurant Sea Side couldn't have been better food and service were outstanding as was our Italian dinner at (i forgot the name) overall your Casino and services were great Will recommend you to our friends
40,in General our trip was excellent..except for Rick in baggage hold area..he was very disrespectful and he was rude. other than our last days experience we found the room.. pools.. and resturants superb
50,Get to the pool early to get a good spot in the shade. If you have two couples it’s worth it to go in on a cabana together but reserve it in advance. Shade fridge couch chairs etc.    Gambling at the Luxor is a bit more affordable for things like craps and blackjack. It’s an easy walk indoors through the shopping area to get from one to the other.
50,Beautiful resort with outstanding service and amenities. Rooms are extremely comfortable and conveniently arranged. The pools are very nice and enjoyable with very good service by the staff as well. Highly recommend it.
50,Mandalay Bay is a great hotel located at the beginning of the Strip. Excellent restaurants for all meals especially Lupo for Italian. Veranda at the Four Seasons on the campus excellent for breakfast. Rooms very nice comfortable and lots of closet and drawer space. Spacious casino with latest slots video poker and table games. Cocktalians check back frequently once they know you are thirsty. Parking lot convenient with elevators available or escalator and stairs if you are in a hurry. Well-dressed crowd approximately casual.
40,Hotel is beautiful clean and staff are all very friendly and very helpful. Rooms have comfortable beds. The pools are the best on the strip. Only bad part is your on one end of the strip so anything you have planned you might half to Uber or use the tram.
40,About 2 miles from Stadium. Restaurants in hotel are really good. Don't touch the water liquor snacks or coffee - $50 minimum fee if sensor feels movement. Beds are really comfortable and rooms are very clean. Bathroom has both shower and tub.
50,Liked staying a bit off of main part of strip. Friendly and efficient staff. East to get taxi wonderful restaurants and restaurant staff. Easy indoor access to many points of interest. Liked the “quietness” of being out of the center area od the strip.
10,Our bathroom had a huge leak from the buckling ceiling with mold. The bathroom floor had dirt and sequins the tub had built up dust/dirt there we sequins and hair bands on the sink behind the Kleenex box....It was horrific.
50,Stayed four days and we had a great time no complaints worth even mentioning.Our suite was about 800 sq ft and fit our needs. Housekeeping showed up every day and did a fine job. We ate at about 8 restaurants and found the food and service to be good at a very reasonable price by Vegas standards. The casino is perfect for slot play machines are spread out and you have space-  We will return—-
50,We always enjoy our stay at Mandalay Bay. The staff is friendly and the property is beautiful. It has great food options and the best pool area/atmosphere on the strip. The only drawback to MB is the location is quite south of everything. But a small price to pay for the level of quality of the resort overall.
50,Its a nice place for summer vacation. And very friendly staff. My family enjoy our one night stay here at mandalay bay. Five star keep it up the good job. Promise to come back again next summer time. Thank you!!
10,Watch your bill as they will try to slip in fraudulent charges related to the mini bar. Hint: the coffee and water that most hotels provide for free are included in the mini bar here. And evidently you don't even have to use these items for them to bill your account for them. I never touched moved consumed or in any other interacted with any item related to the mini bar yet on 2 days of an 8 day stay my account was billed for a $12 mini bar fee. Interestingly those 2 days happened to be the only 2 days that hotel staff entered my room to clean over my 8 night stay. 8 day stay and they would not remove this errant charge after I contacted the front desk before checking out! Thieves is all I have to say about this place. Go elsewhere would be my recommendation!
50,"Spent 6 days starting Memorial Day had an amazing time all thanks to our VIP Host Vince Sidoti. Did ""all the things"" we could squeeze in. Diners shows lazy river cabana...Thanks again for everything!"
50,Great place for families couples or solos. Rooms restaurants and service are the best. We really enjoyed the House of Blues and the huge beach especially the Lazy River! Management is top notch and the casino is very good... I even won a jackpot there. I would like to see many many more traditional type slots but other than that it's a fantastic vacation spot or convention site.
30,As Hilton Grand Vacation owners we usually stay in a Hilton property when we visit Vegas. Since our kids were with us this time we decided to book Mandalay Bay specifically for the pool facilities. Once we arrived we found out that the pool facilities close at 7pm which is extremely early for a “resort” especially considering that the hotel charges a $40 per night “resort fee” for the facility whether you use it or not. Because it closes so early we were unable to use the facility at all on night 1 of 3. (Of course we should have verified the closing time before we booked but I’m noting it here so that others don’t make the same mistake.) However on day 3 of 3 the hotel decided to close half of the facility to hotel guests (the half that contains the wave pool and beach area) due to a convention and on that same day they closed the entire facility early at 3pm. We were told that we were free to use the pools at Luxor or Excalibur but again we did not choose to book this hotel in order to use other neighboring pools. We booked it specifically for the Mandalay Bay water park for which we paid the resort fee to use. The decision to close the pool facility on this day was certainly not communicated to us before we booked and likely would have changed our decision to stay there. So for a 3 night stay we had access to the facilities for a very reduced amount of time that was certainly not worth the fees that we paid for it. In addition the staff are not friendly and were actually very curt. Upon check-in the attendant was much more interested in having a conversation with his colleague than in paying attention to the guest checking in. It is a beautiful hotel and it smells wonderful but it’s located all the way at the bottom of the strip; so to book there you really have to want to stay there and the pool closing and the rude employees just really left a bad taste in our mouth. We’ll be going back to a Hilton property next time we visit LV.
10,We took our family of 6 to Las Vegas we reserved a 2 bedroom suite that was suppose to have 1 king bed and 2 queens. My reservation confirmation confirmed this. I did not checkin through the app because I noticed that our reservation had been changed. When I went to the desk to check in I was told that we had been bumped to a room with 2 beds instead of 3 for 6 people :( They did bring 2 roll aways however spending a week with those was less then ideal especially for the rate we were paying.  We reserved a cabana by the pool one day. It was nice however there was food trash from the day before outside our cabana in the sand beside of our seats.  We were charged for beverages in our suite that we did not use. I have emailed the hotel about that but have not received a response.  Lastly valet destroyed the bumber on the vehicle we rented. We are still working through the issues with that and the rental company.
50,Room was clean and spacious with a beautiful bathroom. Property is very nice with great pools. Lots of good food choices too. We enjoyed time in the sports book where they have lots of large screens. Staff is very friendly.
30,Had trouble sleeping due room not cooling at night. If you open the frig in the room there is a $50 charge and you must purchase rafts for the lazy river- they used to provide them! Rooms and bathrooms are spacious .
40,Booked the Mandalay Bay Panoramic two-bedroom suite for the first time since 2018 and it did not disappoint but was also showing its age. Usually has a fantastic view of the wave pool but this time it was barely in my field of vision. Still very clean and neatly appointed plus the fragrance very pleasant. Recommend.
50,We enjoyed our stay at Mandalay Bay however there was a private event and the beach was closed early.. The hotel however offered the pools at luxor and Excalibur an Excalibur. Pools close at 7 o'clock PM. And I'd hope it would could stay open a little bit longer longer so we can enjoy can enjoy night at the pool and have a evening just relaxing in the Jacuzzi after walking the strip.
50,This is an amazing resort. There are multiple pools and restaurants. The casino was a fun experience as well. The staff was very nice and if something breaks they are on it right away. The staff is informative and answered questions about other parts of the resort. The Michael Jackson One show was great and if we had waited to book at the hotel would have received a 15% discount. The room rates vary a lot so if you have flexibility book when the rates are cheaper. There was something for everyone
30,Property was nice pool was great and Ashley at VIP services was the most pleasant person we dealt with Johnathan at VIP service was the worst. avoid him at all costs. had moths in our room and the water pressure was not the greatest. Moorea suite was nice but would have love to see the suite that we were supposed to get (reef suite) before it was given away. who knows if the other suites are any better. overall not my favorite property especially if your upgrading to a suite. if I only had to deal with Ashley service would have been a 5. Went down to a 3 because of Johnathan
30,Was here late last month for a business trade show. I booked the room a few months ago. What was offered was a twin bed room.I requested a king bed as I was alone.When I arrived at check-in I was told that if I wanted a king bed it would be a couple hundred dollars more a night. I should mention the hotel was not full according to staff and this was a Tuesday. Clearly they had king rooms it was a very expensive nickle & dime way to get more money. I will be looking at other hotels for next trip.
50,Two trips to Vegas and Mandalay Bay has yet to disappoint. Excellent staff in every area. Highly recommended to anyone considering. You can eat something different every meal and share it’s the best food you’ve ever tasted
10,Mandalay Bay has aged since I stayed there 15+ years ago. It's very far from activities and while the room size is nice the amenities were zero. I had two towels and both were very dirty. They specialize in work events for the convention center. Pool was a disaster it's dirty with left over food and drink cups all over. I can't recommend for anyone.
40,Lazy river was a blast especially if you go through the waterfall. Make sure you get a tube...although they are a bit pricey at $30 a pop. Wave pool was really fun too. I was happy to see all the life guards on duty due to the national shortage.
50,Nice and clean and spacious room. Fun at the Wave pool beach area! Nice casino!Nice variety of restaurants and bars! Lots of parking at the garage. Convenient to walk to Luxor and Excalibur. Also has tram linkiyit to Excalibur
10,We booked here solely for the pools and when we got there we were told pools were closed to a private event the whole weekend. We checked in got in the pool and 10 minutes later were told to get out.
50,I absolutely loved staying at Mandalay Bay!! The room was great with a great view and the pool area is amazing!! The only bad thing I can say about the pool area is that the Wave Pool only has one wave every 5 minutes. But it was still one of the best hotels I've stayed at.
50,Great family vacation room was clean. Friendly staff and great pools. Very convenient to get to other hotels nearby. Great food in hotel. Price point was great. Would definitely recommend this hotel.
50,Beautiful clean property great pools and beach! Very friendly helpful staff. Great casino bars and restaurants. I love the Mandalay Bay resort; just a well kept classy resort. I also love that it's located away from the high traffic area of the strip!
50,Mandalay Bay was so wonderful. The pools and lazy river were so relaxing and clean. Just remember to bring your own float for the lazy river. The casino was good. The Foundation Room has the best views on the strip. Great food at Citizens. Self parking was easy and accessible to rooms. Overall great experience. Highly recommend Duece bus pass if wanting to go down the strip or the free tram between Mandalay Bay and Excalibur is convenient too.
30,I get that it was hot outside but it was FREEZING inside the hotel/casino. I had to wear long pants a long-sleeved shirt and a sweatshirt the entire time I was inside. My hands were cold and my nose was frozen! It was the reason I didn't gamble at Mandalay Bay during our five-day stay. Maybe if you didn't blast the AC you could lower the prices of everything in the hotel? Very pricey!!! I won't be back without full winter attire.
10,"My wife and I booked a weekend getaway at Mandalay Bay to enjoy the Moorea Adult pool and enjoy a kid free experience. Upon our arrival to the pool we were notified that most pools were locked out to ""private events"". No notice was given to guests until actually trying to enter the pools. Pool staff was NOT friendly at multiple pool sites at this Casino and simply told us to ""find somewhere else to go"""
50,We are Vegas locals and stayed for three nights of family staycation. Hotel was very clean and employees were all friendly and helpful. Pool area was busy but fun. We would definitely stay here again.
50,I usually stay at Mandalay Bay because of the well maintained and welcoming environment. Service at front desk housekeeping restaurants bell men and casino workers are professional and friendly. I pointed out to my wife clean the parking lot was when we exited to the our car. Our rooms were immaculate and spacious.
50,There are newer hotels there are fancier hotels but there are not better hotels than Mandalay Bay for overall fun service access to great food and good payouts. The beach and the pool are the best in Vegas.
50,Exceeded my expectations. Pool as awesome. Room clean and bed comfortable. Nice bath and shower combo. When the price is right its worth being that far away from all the other hotels and would stay again.
10,The worst service ever. Don't take a chance. There are a lot more hotels you can check in for less and much better service. If you can avoid staying here do it. I have been going to Las Vegas for many years and this was the first time I stayed in Mandalay Bay. I had the worst experienced ever.
50,Mandalay Bay is my favorite hotel to stay in  the food is amazing we love the adult pool and our room is always great  ever time we go to Vegas we always stay here. The rewards are always good too 😊
30,Long waiting times at check-in reception definitely not paying attention to guests' room requests ridiculously overpriced minibar and food court high resort fees hotel shop does not have any prices on display (is that even legal ?) housekeeping disturbing you several times in the morning before check out overcrowded pool area noisy rooms from nearby airport and music at the pool bar at night cheap smelling toiletries wore down furniture and location at the South end of the Strip isn't ideal either. There are better options on the Strip for lesser money.
50,Mandalay Bay is one of my favorite hotels besides their sister location the Delano anything you want to do is accessible the trans & walk ways to the strip makes it convenient to get around without driving. The beds are super comfy.
40,Great stay very clean friendly housekeeping service … amazing pools . Family friendly environment. I disliked the cigarette smell in the hallways. One of the elevators fob panel was missing. Thats all
50,I’ve stayed at several MGM properties Mandalay Bay is my favorite the staff is super friendly & helpful. There pool options are the best they are both adult and kid friendly they have a good amount of attentive life guards and security on hand.
50,I have nothing but good things to say about my stay at Mandalay! The room was clean the hotel staff was helpful and the employees were all courteous. The pool is incredible! This is the 2nd time I have stayed at Mandalay and I probably will again on my next visit.
50,We got a great deal at Mandalay Bay and stayed here for 3 nights on a trip to the Grand Canyon with my grandson. The room was a good size and had a great view of the pool. My grandson loved the pool and spent every afternoon there after trips to Hoover Dam and Valley of Fire. The room was clean and the staff were friendly. We did not have a blow dryer in our room and when we called the front desk they quickly remedied it. Just remember when booking here that there is a $35 daily resort fee and parking also is extra.
50,We actually did Vegas with kids! They loved the lazy River and tide pool. The room was nice and beds were comfortable. Ubers taxi and tram were all easy to get to. It was a perfect place to take the family!
40,Overall hotel was nice needed a few repairs here and there. Pool area was chaos even in the middle of a quiet week. Pools to crowded too many closures due to private parties no tubes for lazy river.
30,If you plan on getting any sleep while you are staying here make certain you get a room far far away from the Michelob Ultra Arena when any concerts/events are scheduled there. We were on the 15th floor facing the pools (and arena) and could hear the concerts 2 nights in a row - it was like we were in the front row and the window vibrated from the sound. We had early morning tee-times the next mornings. Five hours of sleep 2 nights in a row...not good.    The mobile key app never worked for us nor did it work for many of the guests we ran into in the elevator. We had to wait in the check-in line 4 times to get replacement key cards because our key cards wouldn't work for the self-park gate and stopped working for the elevator and room. FOUR times. We finally gave up on using the card for self-park and just called the front desk every time we left the garage.    The hotel rooms are comfortable and large. Citizens restaurant was great - excellent service good food. If you place a mobile order with Starbucks allow a little extra time for your order to ready on the weekends but do take advantage of mobile ordering - it's a big time saver.    The cocktail hostesses on the gaming floor provide excellent service and the Black Jack dealers with whom we interacted were fun. I appreciate a card dealer who can carry on a conversation with customers at the table.    I enjoyed the Wave Pool and very much appreciated having the lifeguards there watching the kids - it wasn't always easy for me to see them from my vantage point. The lifeguards were kind to the kids providing them gentle guidance on where it was safe to play and wait for waves.    The hotel is fine - to me they are all the same in Vegas. I just did not appreciate having to listen to two concerts I was not interested in attending and losing a lot of sleep because of it.
40,Very very nice hotel and casino. Not sure about the pools since they were all closed during my stay. Super nice casino. Even nicer restaurants - Lupo had great italian food and excellent service- would go back with family and friends
50,The stay was great. Hotel and accommodation were nice. We had no issues at this hotel. There are lots of activities to do while staying here. The pools are exceptions and the food choices give a variety of things to choose from. Rooms are in good shape as well.
20,Overall value for what you pay is low! Extremely overpriced food and drinks that are nothing extraordinary. If not for business I would never spend my vacation in Vegas. Overcrowded; and the exercise facility was pathetic. All fake!
20,To be honest the bed was amazing rooms were okay but water cups were dirty. The casino was nice large and not terribly busy. The food sucked at every restaurant that we ate at in the hotel. Biggest issue was that the pools were closed on multiple days for private parties which was the whole reason we chose to stay at Mandalay bay.
40,The hotel is clean and the staff are very friendly and courteous. Lots of choices for restaurants. The rooms facing the airport are a little noisy. The pools are great especially for kids. Located at one end of the strip so not the greatest location. Overall a great hotel for the price.
50,The hotel must offer for free the facilities at beach bay and pools. 500 hds for umbrellas and beach chair paying the day fee for been there I think is not fair. But I an excellent hotel near the AirPort
50,Did 3 nights to visit attractions. The hotel was clean and staff was very helpful. Room was comfortable and clean. I was weirded by the “scales” that are monitoring the water or fridge. You can’t use the fridge the store anything you have. In room coffee is monitored and will cost you $$. First time I’ve ever stayed where you had to pay for in room coffee. Pool was clean and plenty of lounge chairs. I will definitely return.
40,I was upset that so many non guest were at the pool taking away from the paying guest experience. There wasn’t enough seating or rafts for us paying guest which was very frustrating. The host at the entrances was allowing anyone to come In
50,The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are fantastic. The swimming pools well maintained and fun. The hotel lobby is extremely nice. The casino is very very nice and very clean. The hotel employees are very nice and knowledgeable. Overall it was a great week
50,Beautiful resort/casino! Would definitely return in the near future and highly recommend this resort/casino to everyone with or without children. Everything was clean and well kept. A little tricky finding parking area but once parked everything is within walking distance or by tram.
30,The staff are lovely but the beds are so uncomfortable very hard rough sheets.The staff at the restaurant Lupo are exceptional. I made a reservation for Lupo and immediately got a text message asking for any food dislikes or allergies or if we celebrating anything.
50,Great hotel clean everyone was very friendly and attentive. Kids had an amazing time enjoying the pool. Parents enjoyed the drinks by the pool. Room was clean and super quiet. Will definitely return!
50,We always thoroughly enjoy our stays with Mandalay Bay. The facilities and staff are awesome. The pool options are terrific. It’s a great location to base all our activities from. The casino is clean and staffed with great people. Mandalay Bay is a Vegas favorite!
40,Overall experience was amazing except for every time I go back to the room I get that dated smell that smells like an old building/house. It really doesn't ruin the experience. I just don't like it. The for was amazing at Lupo's. I would definitely come back
50,Great access to the strip shows and check out the rewards app we got a lot of play $$ in credits just for playing! It was non stop food and fun! Jumped on the Tram to Excalibur and then the monorail down to the strip!
20,"3 star hotel at best. We stayed here becuase of the pool and the fact our first two choices where booked. We went down to the pool to find out the two pools where booked. We have a 6 year old and he's two short for the wave pool so where sent to a tiny pool next to the binki bar. The pool looked like it was from the 80s. It has cracked concrete and missing tiles and grouting. We visited this pool twice that Saturday first thing in the morning just barley getting a chair then later that day to allow the 6 year a final chance to swim before dinner as the pool closes at 7:00pm. On the second visit becuse the two other pools where closed the little pool was full of drunks had floating beer cans in the water and smelt of weed. The closing of the other two pools meant there was no where for the partiers and the families or the partiers to go their separate ways. We even had one drunk thatsmelt of weed and out of his mind wade over to tell me and my 6 year old his life story. Plus on top of that hey charged us full pice for the ""resort fee"" even with the the two bigger pools being closed for a private event without notice. Next the self parking needs better signage I honestly believe the are not making it easy to force you to use their valet which we ultimately did. The sign and ticket clearly stated it was $20 but our card was charged $30. When we go to out room I hit the Bell Hope button on the phone only to wait 15 minutes to get some hotel resurant. Two transfers later I got the bell hop and our luggage was delivered. Secondly our room while ok looks like it was from the 70's with the dark and dated motifs. The bathroom had trash on the floor and the grout was black in many areas. Also anytime one of our neighboring rooms would use their bathroom our sink would gurgle for 5-10 minutes. I have video of this but the review want allow me to add it. The beds where comfortable but the pillows where super thick and not very good if you like a thinner pillow. Plus as I lay here typing this at 1:45 am all I hear is the party happening down at the pool. Omce agai. I have this on video but thw review want allow me to post it. The walls are thin and you hear your neighbors and all the outside noise. Plus we hear every airplane that takes off. Oh and if they ask if you want a pool view room tell them no. It is where all nightly parties are held and the view is mostly of the airport run way across the street. Also there is no fridge for you to use. Instead they have have an out dated mini bar like a cheap hotel in shade part of town would have that charges you if you even touch a drink or the bag of nuts just to see what it is. We have been to 20+ countries and almost all of the states and have stated at 5 star hotels in Florida NYC LA Porto Rico Bahamas and many other locations. This hotel does good to get 3 stars. We will not be staying here again. Let's hope check out goes good tomorrow or I will have to take back a few other stars."
50,I stay at this resort/casino frequently. The rooms are fairly large very clean and mobile check in so convenient. Casino is clean and not very smoky. They have several pool areas including a wave pool. The pool areas are well maintained with great wait staff and lots of seating. It is a the far end of the south end of the strip but a tram will take you to Luxor and Excalibur. From there you can easily walk to several casinos including NY NY Tropicana and MGM Grand. It’s a great place to stay.
40,Room was clean and nice. We did request a king but they only had 2 queens left which was a little disappointing but we got in late and I should have checked in on my app early to guarantee the king room. The video poker bar behind eye candy is great too. There were plenty of seats by the pool too but beware the sand is extremely hot on your feet. Mandalay is my go-to hotel all of the time and its our favorite despite it being at the end of the strip.
50,Originally booked trip to see Pearl Jam. They got COVID & cancelled last minute. That was a minor bummer But Mandalay Bay treated me so well that the trip turned out Great anyway! In fact I just booked an August trip!
40,"We booked this resort for the pool and outdoor amenities. The wave pool outdoor pools and massive wave pool are amazing. Although the resort charges everyone a $40 resort fee per day we were not able to use the wave pool and other pools one day due to a ""private event."" They had large signs made so it seems like this is a common occurrence. The room was clean and the housekeeping team should be commended as the entire resort was impeccable. All of the food from various places was amazing as well. We were just disappointed that we booked the Mandalay Bay for the pool but the average person cannot use it if someone with more $ decides to rent it instead."
50,Much better than the larger casinos like Caesars Palace where you can easily get lost. Rooms here and amazing and pool area is nice and huge as well. Many places to eat here too plus easy access to Luxor and Excalibur.
50,Highly recommend the Mandalay for both couples get-away or family vaca. The casino property has the best of all Vegas worlds. No complaints. Smells like Paradise clean fun affordable luxury best pool.
50,Quick and easy to check in and check out friendly staff. Great shopping mall area  Clean rooms comfortable beds and good housekeeping. Excellent pool area for families fun and entertaining. I would highly recommend staying here I receive emails with room promos and book our yearly stay three to four month out
50,Mandalay Bay is our home away from home we are there 5 to 7 times a year top notch accommodations five star restaurants amazing night clubs and a casino floor that is interactive and fun and not crazy
40,Chose Mandalay Bay for the location and the pool. Had a strip view room and it was nice and very clean. When walking in off the strip the hotel smelled nice and fresh not like smoke which was a plus. Self parking was convenient as well. Pool area was nice but don’t remember the wave pool having such small waves. Lazy river was way too crowded and drinks were way overpriced for what you got. Our beach concert was cancelled due to high winds which was a bummer. Not being able to use the room refrigerator was kind of ridiculous and no coffee available in the room for having to pay a high resort fee. Great stay though and would choose this resort again.
20,"I was trying to take my children on a vacation to get away. Wave pool is a joke with 1 wave every 90 seconds and children under 48"" are not allowed in the wave pool even with an adult. Bring your own tube! No rentals and the tubes to buy are expensive!  Be aware!!! You may not use the refrigerator in the room for personal use it is stocked and they weigh it so they know what you use or if you remove anything!  They closed the pool area with a one day notice for an event. This was the main reason we picked this hotel so we were disappointed to say the least!  Water in the hotel is $6.00 and there are no prices listed in the hotel market. BE CAREFUL!!!  Showers are very small in the rooms lotion gave me a skin rash"
50,This was an excellent place to stay awesome experience friendly staff and great Amenities nice casino a city with in a city experience I had the best time and can’t wait to go back!!!! This will be my go to resort
50,I recommend this hotel 100% . The staff is really nice  the room was amazing  so cleaned and has whatever you need . It looks like a new hotel . The pools are amazing . I feel like I was on the beach And the other side like water park . I can’t wait to go back ..
50,It was so much fun we enjoyed it and it was super kid friendly!  We didn’t have to leave the hotel at all. We went to the aquarium ate at the hotel got room service & enjoyed dinner at house of blues
50,Easy online check is perfect room was clean & well equipped.  Restaurants good & House of Blues is such a good venue.  Parking easy although not cheap drinks a little expensive but it’s the Strip.  Would stay again.
50,Hosted a group and the Media Suite was super for it. Nice bar media capabilities and space were great. Andrew at front desk helped with securing nine (9) rooms. House of Blues restaurant was good. Only thing wish I'd had better luck at tables.
30,Took calling the front desk to get room clean. They cancelled cabana last minute for some corporate event instead. It was my whole reason for staying at this hotel. Also staff could be friendlier. Not happy with paying to park at a hotel I am already spending hundreds to stay at.
50,Amazing beyond words! Loved every minute of our stay! People were so friendly and helpful. Loved all the beautiful sites! Amazing shows! Beatles show I have never seen anything like this! Also Rod Stewart was fantastic!
50,Great time. Check in was easy and the room was super. Food was very good and so was the service. Played the slot machines and enjoyed them. Drink service was outstanding. So over all it was a very good visit.
50,The hotel and casino was nice and amenities was okay. Coffee wasn’t free we were charged $12.00 pre-fixed coffee for 2 (with cream sugar and coffee). There is not a lot of restaurants within the hotel. Starbucks closes early. The buffet is still closed. Overall we enjoyed our stay and the room service.
20,The pro  The strip view was great and the spacious room was comfortable.  The cons  We would have enjoyed our time in the room more if we could have had a coffee in the morning and could have had access to cold water. Given that we paid for the room and a hefty resort fee was added we refused to pay $12 for a cup of coffee from the machine in the room. Neither did we want to pay $10 for a small bottle of water or get ‘fined’ $50 for putting our own water in the fridge!    We were very disappointed at the ‘beach’ experience. Unless you pre book one of the  paid for sun loungers and umbrellas (from $25-$150 each item) you cannot guarantee a space with some shade. The free sun loungers were set out in rows with not even an inch of space between them so you were lying right next to a stranger (assuming you were lucky enough to get there at 8am and secure one!). There was another option which was to book a cabana but the prices of those were exorbitant from $500 up to thousands! I felt sorry for families arriving later as we saw very disappointed children. On our last day most of the beach was closed including the biggest area by the wave pool. The small part that was open closed at 3pm for a private event. There was no offer of a reduction in the resort fee!    Everything in the hotel was very expensive including the on site restaurants and every member of staff expects a handsome tip.    Very surprised at the lack of recycling in evidence. Virtually no vegetarian or even healthy options in the restaurants and it would be impossible to be a vegan.    I have ticked Vegas off my bucket list. I won’t be back.
50,Our first time at Mandalay Bay and we were very impressed! Loved the 2 bedroom king suite! We are all booked in the same room for October! The casino is very well laid out and the restaurants are amazing!
50,The room was very clean and spacious. Everyone one was friendly and very helpful. The view of the strip from my room was breath taking at night. Loved the sanded beach area and the wave pool.  Great shopping and dining right in the resort.
50,Beautiful and CLEAN hotel Friendly AND helpful staff everywhere on the property BEST pool because of the music lazy River wave pool and the beach! First time stay for us celebrating our anniversary. We will DEFINITELY return!
50,Great food options at Mandalay Bay and surrounding area with plenty of activities and fun. We drove in parked the car and didn’t need it again until it was time to come home. We actually extended our stay an extra day because we were having a really good getaway.
50,The pictures on the website were helpful with description of the room. I like the double sinks private toilet room and the separate batt tub and shower. There were two separate closets with plenty of hangers in both.
50,Great and foremost best experience ever. Room was so beautiful and clean. View from the room was just historic.loved every second of my stay. From checkin to checkout from my phone Everything was so easy.
50,Well taken care of during our short stay. Enjoyed your dining areas and the view from our room with a great sunset and also enjoyed your water complex. Easy access to the strip. Looking forward to our next stay . Weather was just fine for that weekend in the 80’s
50,"Beautiful Hotel and Casino. Awesome Rock band in the Casino great DJ Dance club in the Casino. Nice Gym. VIP check in Experience was terrific. Room was beautiful with a large bathroom with ""his and her"" sinks. Cleaning/Maid service were fantastic. Room was very clean. Only negative is the refrisgerator in the room is for them to charge you for anything that is in it. It is not for your personal use. There is no bathroom near the gym. It is in the spa and when my wife tried to use the bathroom she was told by the girl in the spa that ""the bathrooms were only for people who were getting massages not for any hotel guest to use"". We thought that was just wrong. If that is the rule then build a bathroom in the gym for people who are working out to use. Casino was expensive with lowest Craps table being $25. Lounge chairs at the pools are some for free but others for pay and were very over priced. The food at the pool was Resturant Depot quality needs improvement for this caliber hotel."
50,Mandalay Bay is my go to hotel when I visit. I always have a great experience when I’m there. It’s a clean and comfortable hotel with friendly staff. I would recommend this to any of my family or friends.
50,From the time I checked in at the front desk to the time I spent at the pool and the casino and even my room attendant everything was amazing. I stayed in room 12302 and would recommend that the shower have maintenance. The room was beautiful I loved the navy blue carpeting and the shears. I would highly recommend the pool to anyone who wanted to vacation there. I cannot wait to return. I only wished Michael Jackson was in town because I certainly would have wished to see that show but they were on vacation.
40,The hotel staff was great. The rooms were clean and plenty options for food although it wasn't cheap. Swimming pools were magnificent and plenty of them. I didn't care for all the up-charges and taxes.
50,My stay was perfectme and my wife loves staying hereGreat viewsrooms are always clean & odorless its always smooth check in & outwill be staying here for sure in the future.Also casino has great food.
50,We always stay at MB for part of our LV trips. We had a comped penthouse suite this time and it was very nice. We like that MB is at the far end of the strip and has a bit less foot traffic than some center strip hotels. The pools are great. Casino is not great; poor VP.
50,Great location - bus stop right across st.  Very clean professional staff. Large casino- several restaurants- popular place.  Room service was fast plentiful and delicious.  Quick check in and check out.
50,Never stayed here before. Was amazingly beautiful. Enjoyed the room and everyone was very nice. We have booked again in October for my husband's 50th Birthday with some of our family. Can't wait to get back.
50,Great will return Comfortable bed. Clean room maid service friendly staff front desk was super great . Easy access to strip just wish restaurants stayed open a little later pool area was exciting vert clean hotel
50,Was a nice set up. The pool areas are very close to the guest elevators. The rooms and bed are very nice and the soaking tub is outstanding. Moorea Beach is a nice escape from a busier main pool area. The tram to excalibur/ luxor is a nice compensation for the south end location. Housekeeping was daily and attentive. The cocktail waitresses at the pool were very friendly and attentive. House of Blues is nice for dinner. Had some lucky streaks in casino. Would rebook without question for the same rate/ offer I had this time.
50,The resort was top notch in cleanliness and amenities. We enjoyed the pool areas and the staff was always friendly and accommodating. The layout was easy to navigate through and we felt safe and secure at all times.
50,Hotel was very clean staff very friendly overall stay was excellent. The restaurant Strip Steak was delicious the family style sides is a great idea. Our waiters were helpful and attentive. The meal was worth every penny.
50,Great place to stay  rooms were amazing and I got a strip view which was terrific 👍🏾  The only thing that I didn’t like was that all the table games were 25$ n up  little pricey  The tram was a bonus to travel to and from other hotels
50,We love the Mandalay Bay! The rooms are spacious and the amenities plentiful. We generally stay several days but this time only one night on each end if our trip because we were sightseeing in Arizona and Utah. The hotel has several great restaurants and is very near the airport too in terms of convenience. The mobile check in is great! No standing in long lines and you can get your room keys yourself! I highly recommend the Mandalay Bay!
50,Great customer service. Friendly staff for sure. The staff‘s effort and service was Exceeded only by their willingness to be of help. I have stayed at Mandalay Bay several times and I have never been disappointed with any expectation I have had for a Las Vegas casino. The surrounding eating establishments have always served good food and I am always pleased with the check in and check out services.
30,No warning on one of our days that pool was only half open and closing 5 hours early....I guess some company rented it out which is fine if we could know that at booking or possibly be compensated for the $40 a day resort fee but nah.
40,They tried to charge me $12 for just PICKING UP THE COFFEE CUP in the room saying items were weight sensitive and you have 30 seconds to put it down! $50 per day if you open the fridge! Nowhere is it posted where you can is comp dollars so you need to ask before you buy.
40,You don’t have any room to put anything in the fridge so don’t bother buying anything. There’s no water provided for drinking (only Fiji which you have to pay for) you have to buy a $6-$7 water bottle everyday. I also went there for my anniversary and they didn’t do anything or mention anything regarding that even though it asked when I booked if it was a special day. Anything would have been appreciated. I stayed at a much cheaper hotel which gave us a basket of chocolates and a card saying congratulations. Thinking this was a better quality hotel they would at least do something but nothing at all. Which was a bit disappointing.
30,The hotel was average the room was horrible. It was so hot at night. The ac could not keep the room cool. Had to go and buy fans to help. The pool was nice. The food for what you got was super expensive.
10,"We booked a staycation at Mandalay Bay for June 1 and 2. On the morning of June 1 after the cancellation window had passed I got an e-mail saying the pool would be closed for a private event on June 2. Only the lazy river would be available and then they'd kick us out at 3:00 p.m. Unreal. So dishonest - they obviously knew this was the case for months but they only chose to tell us after it was too late to cancel our trip. They offered ""apologies for any inconvenience"" though.  The staff was shocked too -- they had no idea this was happening to the guests. The general response from them was ""yeah that sounds like MGM."" It was funny to hear all the stories from the staff about how terrible of a company this has become. I guess I see why now. Advertising your pool as a main attraction charging very high rates for mid-week plus $50 in resort fees per day to use their magical pool and then they sell it to a higher bidder and kick you out.  The Beach that was sold out was pretty much empty too. All of us peons had to crush into the lazy river area until they kicked us out. Bad look all the way around. I'll never go back to MGM properties (well except when I go see the Knights play)."
10,Dirty rooms dirty hallways staff not friendly at all trying to get cocktail service at the casino floor is a challenge had to pay for valet parking $30 per day! This is ridiculous! After paying for the room and a resort fee!  Will never come back here again oh our sink was backed up as well & stains on the bed sheets when I asked to get it changed at midnight this is when I noticed it the front desk was having an attitude about it!
50,Mandalay is a beautiful place to visit. I had a great view where is I was able to see the strip. The people where 😊! I was relaxed and carefree. Met family there and plan to do it again. Food was great and love the pool area. I’ll be back!
50,The whole family enjoyed the stay. If you're taking teens or kids to Vegas MB is probably one of the best places to stay. Disappointed in the rewards changes however. Those that chose to spend their money on non gaming amenities don't earn teir credits anywhere near what the used to.
40,This trip was fun. Check in was busy and needed to wait. Parking can be an issue for event days. The pool was great but need to go early as it gets busy. Slots are tight. Didn't see alot if people winning. Need more lower cost food options.
40,Great stay. Pros: Room was clean and well maintained. We were on the 58th floor. We found the casino and property in general to be much nicer and classier then other hotels we’ve visited in Vegas. More of a laid back/family vibe not a party atmosphere with 21 year olds. Restaurants were all good albeit a bit pricey. All staff were friendly. The resort is far from the action but the tram to Luxor and Excalibur help with that (the tram is not 24/7) and the monorail at mgm is reasonably priced  Cons: $50 to use the mini fridge - we were told by someone (not hotel employee) that many of the hotels have a similar fee brought on by covid to cover the cost/time to sanitize the fridge and mini bar contents. Pool was nice but the chairs are packed in like sardines. Rental fee for 1 cushioned longer without umbrella was $140. We found that most of the shaded areas for the free loungers are near the lazy river. This shade is minimal so go early to get a good spot (before 9:30am) but make sure there is a person to hold the chairs or your stuff will be cleared off by other guests/staff. For the lazy river bring your own tube as they do not rent them. You can buy one at the beach store for approximately $30. Food and drink at the pool is ridiculously priced.  While we were put off by the high costs of some things we would still stay here again and recommend Mandalay to anyone not looking for a party hotel.
30,"I thought this would be the first super nice hotel that I would get to stay in. I was wrong.  All of my issues were with the room itself. The toilet was the worst. It was partially/full on clogged the whole time we were there. It made strange noises randomly. My boyfriend had to leave the room 3 times after midnight to use the restrooms downstairs because of it.  The bathtub had some dirt or something in it.  We rented and paid for a movie that did not work. It kept freezing and not playing over and over.  This would have to be the worst part about my stay; I had just gotten out of the shower and I started clicking through on the TV to look at the prices for the drinks in the mini fridge naked and about 5-7 minutes later someone OPENS MY ROOM DOOR WITH A KEY and calls out 'Is there anything I can help you with for the mini fridge items?"". Unacceptable! If he knocked I did not hear it and the next thing I know a man has my room door open."
50,Great for family’s not over crowded and nice and clean.We will be back before end of year to stay longer. Ok that’s all I got I can’t believe you made me type this many words this is way too many words for this !!!!!!!!!
40,We stay at Mandalay Bay for a family Holiday. We start our stay with a great service from the front desk at checking.  We enjoyed the pool as always every time we visit.  The elevators seem a bit crowded at times and people where very noisy at time.  Overall we did enjoyed our stay.  Mandalay is our first choice of hotel in Vegas considering amenity’s and the pool.
10,The place was disgusting the curtains had white stains on them the couches were stained the beams for the curtains were cracked the walls near the closets and doors were dirty the circle vanity mirror needs new lighting and was loose it needed tightening our AC was blowing out cold air on 80 degrees. I called guest services and a repair man came to fix it; there was a hole in the wall he says and he patched it up. Our sink was clogged repair man had to repair that I had a do not disturb sign on my door Wednesday morning and someone from your hotel barged in telling us that it was time for checkout however it was NOT…checkout was today June 2 2022. Overall I’m extremely disappointed in this hotel in the way checkout went…I was told that I should’ve reported it to the front desk so they could’ve addressed the issue. Why report all these issues when all you’re going to do is have me wait even longer to get checked into my room because no other elite king suites were ready?! Why report anything when all you’re going to do is send another staff member into MY SPACE when I’m on vacation instead of giving me a new room entirely! How dare she say I should’ve reported the issues so that I could be accommodated in food!
10,We booked this hotel because it was considered upscale and for the pools. The first thing we did when we got to the room was look for the fridge. Beware it’s a mini bar. If you want to use it for your water it’s $50! Even the dumpiest hotel on the strip gives you a damn fridge! Be sure to find out if those nice pools you came to use are actually going to be open for you or if the hotel is double dipping on your exorbitant resort fees and booking a “private event”. During the evening there was one sign posted by the elevators informing anyone that happened to see it that the wave pool and morea beach would be closed the next day. That sucked but at least we got to enjoy it one day. The next day all hotel guests that weren’t part of the special private party were jammed into the lagoon pool area  some standing and waiting for a lounger to become available. At 3 pm on the dot the lifeguards blew their whistles and told us the pool was closed and we had to leave. The employees would stand near us and try to intimidate us to move faster sorry I can’t pack up and get dressed with no warning in 7 minutes. One guest asked a security guard what (pool) was open and he was told none. When the guest asked what was his family supposed to do “go sit it their room?” the guard shrugged. As we followed the throng of guests to the front desk to complain we then saw the sign informing us of the pool closing. Thanks for nothing Mandalay Bay we won’t be back.
10,$12 for in-room coffee; $18 for a bottle of water $50 to use the in-room fridge (yes $50 per night to use the in-room refrigerator) all this before they take your money at the tables and slots - this is what greed looks like people pure evil greed!
50,great staff. though location at the end of strip was problematic trams helped. nice variety of shops and eating places. need better soaps/shampoos in room. sleeping experience was great. great pool area.
50,Awesome stay we enjoy our stay!!! My kids especially enjoy wave pool lazy river. Rooms were clean and alot space in our room. We had the view of seeing all the pools. So beautiful. I can't wait to come back again.
50,This was a different kind of Vegas trip for me as I brought my 2 youngest with me this time (18 & 11) so I was a little worried if they would enjoy ot or not. Mandalay Bay was a hit! They loved the pool area the food at both restaurants we went to in Mandalay and the Shark Reef and aquarium was a big hit. Getting to touch the little Rays was my 11yr olds favorite part. The only downside is now she will be asking me to come every time I go.. 🤣
30,We love staying at Mandalay Bay. The pool area has always been our favorite. Unfortunately the beds this time were in bad shape. They actually has dents in the bed and our backs hurt fir the entire stay.phone was broke and a lamp.
50,Overall good value self parking is quite far elevators can be quite crowded at times. Casino needs more video poker. But good variety of new games avail if you like the penny multi denom games. We will be back.
50,The only concern is if you have small children the toilet is scary. It has a powerful and loud flush.  Besides that I can only say good things about Mandalay Bay. Walking distance to the events we attended. Great affordable food. Room is nice. Plenty to do in the resort. You don't need to leave the property. Flat rate taxis to and from the airport. Comfortable beds.
10,Pools were overcrowded with locals sneaking in through side gate propped open. I walked straight through front entrance twice without being checked for my room key. A woman passed out and vomited in pool from being over served. Lots of trash everywhere in pool around the deck. Also the room next to me had many dogs( isn’t there a limit on the number allowed?) with constant barking.
20,We were hoping to get upgraded to a better room than we had originally had due to the needle in the fridge that we found but we only got switched to another room down the hall. The housekeeping lady came in and checked the sodas where the needle was and put them back so I didn’t feel comfortable because she didn’t properly sanitize the sodas.
50,We are not gamblers but the casino is huge and doesn’t smell of smoke it has an Amazing pool area ! Beautiful clean rooms my son and granddaughter enjoyed the Lazy river. We always enjoy a meal at House of Blues !
40,Hell if I'm paying for $300.00 for an umbrella and 2 chairs. Not much shade down at the pool. I wanted to go closer to the Tidal Wave wall but Johnny Pool Police said I couldn't. Yeah even their cabanas (which start at $550.00) are way OVERPRICED. It may be Vegas but come on CEO's. Have to pay for their salaries. GREED MAN.
50,the location is nice and the room was beautiful. The room is pricey and the stocked bar was over the top. Never touched it. Dinner at the Foundation Room was exceptional. So much to see just inside Mandalay Bay.
50,Enjoyed my stay during my trip. Make sure you try the pool. Water is good and cold. Valet is fast and so are the pick ups from ride share apps. Nice view at night and lots look at. I will be booking again
40,This is a good hotel for a business tradeshow. I'm personally not a fan of Vegas at all but when you have to spend a week out in this town for work it is at least nice to sleep eat and attend the tradeshow all in one place.
50,The room was perfect the casino clean and well staffed the restaurants were varied (and oh so good) and my stay at Mandalay Bay was the best trip to Vegas I've ever had. I have a new go-to resort for when I'm in town (for business or pleasure) and I'm already planning my next getaway.
50,Check in was so easy from my phone before I even got to Vegas. Nice view of strip and airport. I loved loved the beach/pool. Would definitely stay here again even just for that!!! Wish the slots could've shown me more love!!
50,Service is exceptional ! Rooms are nice and clean . The pool is fun for the whole family.Everything you need is in the hotel shops / food/ shows/ casino . The smell is amazing and fresh in the reaort as well big plus!
30,I can hear next room TV sound and sounds from hall not a good choice if you need a quite room. Try to call front desk if you don’t mind waiting and hanging there. No chair/dirty towels occupied over chair in Over crowded pool
20,I am disappointed with my overall experience. I came to Vegas with my three kids and husband for a much-needed weekend away. After spending nearly an hour to check in they were finally able to accommodate our request that they had confirmed the day before for me (connecting rooms for our children). I was told there be a crib at wedding up there but when we got to the room there was none. After 11 phone calls to guest services every 10 minutes on the minute I was finally given the chance to speak to yet another supervisor who magically found a staff person to bring our crib upstairs to us. Reservation which I hired a babysitter to attend forcing us to eat at a more expensive less optimal restaurant on property. On top of all this there was sand in our bathtub and a door Dash order from May 22 (five days ahead of our arrival) sitting in our fridge. The worst part was no one seemed to care. I get that it was a holiday weekend but we all should be treated like humans.
50,My stay at Mandalay Bay was wonderful. The friendliness of the check-in staff was a great start to my stay. My room was excellent and the housekeeping staff does everything possible to provide great service. It is a very large hotel with great amenities. The pool area is very comfortable and enjoyable. The restaurants are very good especially the Border Grill. The sports book is very comfortable for watching sports and my favorite horse racing. My stay was wonderful despite my lack of success at the gaming tables. A little more luck would have made for a perfect weekend. Thank you to Mandalay Bay and its friendly staff for a great weekend and experience. Mandalay Bay is the place to go for a great weekend!
50,The location was great and close to many attractions around Vegas and the strip. The customer service was amazing as they attended to every need. We loved the amenities they offered and the pool was one of the best. Would definitely be staying here next time we are in Vegas.
50,We traveled with our 2 young kids and our teenager. They enjoyed all the pools. We rented a cabana and our hosts were exceptional. Drinks and food were a bit pricey but hey it’s Vegas! We also visited the Shark Reef which was great for the kids.
40,Clean rooms pretty busy during my stay the pool was a little congested very pricey but that’s what expected overall great experience! My family had a blast and we will definitely come again to this hotel!
50,Excellent service! Great pool and staff! Easy check-in and check-out!! Great spacious rooms with a great view!! Would recommend ans visit in the future again!! Not sure what else to say! 200 characters minimum is too much!
50,The Mandalay Bay hotel/ Casino/ resorts was very nice and the staff was very professional and friendly too.. I highly recommend this hotel 🏨 to anyone traveling to Las Vegas in the future.. I will most definitely be returning to this hotel
30,I got charged $22 for a bottle of water and i had two of them for $44 dollars. There should be prices on the accessories in the room that way if i had seen $22 dollars for a bottle water i would of never touched it
50,Overall a great property. Pools are amazing Tram is easy to access and staff is very nice/friendly. The restaurant's are great quality. Bars with music are lots of fun. Would recommend this to anyone that is considering a Vegas stay!
30,Our stay was good other than our view was horrible. It was of the ac units on a roof and I didn't like the fact that there is no in room refrigerator. only the mini bar fridge that they charge you $50 dollars a day to use
30,The room was nice for three adults and one kid. Take note the hotel would charge you if you put stuff in the fridge; no disclaimer or notice. They charge arbitrarily. We put a monster and a small lunchable and they charged $50 for two days. Do not drink their waters; way over priced not worth it. Go to the market downstairs. Their bathroom needs a better odor extractor; and their staff need better cleaning equipment the vacuum smelled as if it's burning.
40,Overall was a great stay. Be prepared to pay for cabs - even using the free shuttle and pay shuttle its location is too far south and ended up with us taking over 23000 steps in a day (and that was using the monorails). Beds are very comfy for a hotel. Tubes are not included in the lazy river so bring your own because the price to buy them there is astronomical. Employees were very friendly. Wish they had robes in the rooms but bathrooms were nice and the tub was amazing.
50,We stayed for 3 nights in May 2022. Room and hotel was clean and staff was friendly. Our kids loved the lazy river and wave pool but it's a shame that even the umbrellas (present on the beach) cost money to be opened. There were absolutely no shaded area to rest. A bit far from other hotels.
10,Really poor still waiting on a room at 16.21 supposed to be ready at 15.00 Def not VIP standard    My birthday and nice suite booked but really disappointed after long road trip from LA    Housekeeping communication issues
50,if traveling with kids they have the best Pool and decent size room only bad thing is it is pricey for everything in this Hotel so if you have the money to spend this Hotel is perfect sign up for MGM awards it will help for future trips
50,The MGM prices choices and location for their resorts was excellent … Mandalay had everything thing… great restaurants… and the rewards program is great… for a Pearl status I enjoyed playing slots and got free parking using my rewards card for in and out… view from room of pool was great
30,Didn’t get the strip you as promised and was refunded money back when I never asked to. Very frustrating with the staff. Everything was fine until the staff frustrated me. I probably won’t be staying here again
50,The hotel was clean and had beautiful energy. I look forward to returning. The staff were polite and there was so much more to do than just gamble. The shows were phenomenal. The food was OUTSTANDING!
50,Everything went smooth the lady at the front helped us so much and our room was incredible the staff were so nice and loved every minute of our stay! Definitely will be coming back in the near future. Thank you
50,Super clean and the pool area was fantastic. Great for kids! We are thinking about bringing our five kids back next spring. Would definitely recommend to anyone. The wait staff at the bell desk went above and beyond for everything we needed during our stay
10,Realized ac wasn’t working the minute I walked into the room. Messed with the thermostat and that didn’t help. Made several calls to the front desk and that was not successful. Had to stay out of the room as much as possible to not die of a heat stroke
10,Unprofessionalism and racist security I will never stay at this establishment ever again. I was unlawfully detained and security never told me what I did. They had me handcuffed super tight and now my wrists are bruised and scraped up.
50,We enjoy staying at Mandalay Bay for a number of reasons. There are plenty of things to do not a lot of people that we have to contend with the facilities are top notch and we just enjoy the environment
50,Came for EDC Las Vegas 2022 chose to stay here since camping was sold out. Bed could not have been more comfortable. Rooms quiet for day sleep and blackout drapes effective. I got a big bathtub and didn't even request one! Most hotels these days only have the stand up shower option but occasionally I just want to soak all the smoke and dust and everything out of my hair and pours and more effective from super deep tub. Atmosphere in Casino was upscale and nice and parking relatively easy once you figure to to take Frank Sinatra BLVD. Parking is free if you area MLife member. Gambling was a wash for me didn't get raked over calls but no ginormous jackpot either but was able to play long enough on my bankroll to have a good time.
50,Beautiful hotel a lot there! Pool could be open later though. Good shops great food. Sizable rooms good views. Location is decent and easy to commute to other properties. Will stay here in the future
10,"Overpriced room $400 for a view of the asphalt roof and see the 15 freeway! Paid 50% more than it was worth especially since there was no weekday holiday and the hotel had 100's of empty room according to staff. Door locks/keys not working. A continued annoyance for a very short stay as we were in and out of the room often. Checkout was at 11 am when for most hotels it is at 12 noon. TV not working except to watch the hotel advertising or the expensive pay per view programs.    By the way we also went to the ""shark reef aquarium"". Not worth the $60 bucks. Better get a membership at Netflix and for that you'll see and learn all you need a thousand times more about sharks. Also it pains me to see wild animals in cages or glass boxes because they belong in the wilderness and the ocean not in some fake nature glass display.    Lastly they overbilled me an additional $12 for no reason despite the printed-out invoice they gave me showing less. Not that it makes much of a difference for me but it just shows they are not honest. If you like the strip there are much better hotels up the Blvd. with better location. Was a first and will be a last. Don't waste your money."
50,First time staying at the mandalay resort and we’re impressed with the service and quality of food and drinks. It’s me if the places where we can buoyed spending most of our time just lounging at the property because we were happy.
50,No complaints even when i had trouble with my room keys they were very helpful and kind. They made up for the inconvenience. The room was very nice and comfortable too. This is the best experience I’ve had starting in Las Vegas
50,First class hotel everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Meals were fabulous and we went to the Santana concert and the Michael Jackson cirque du solie. Outstanding shows and they couldn’t have been better. We will remember this trip for a long time.
30,Upon arrival we were told the king room we reserved and prepaid for were sold out. We were downgraded to a double queen room making our sleep very cramped. Don’t take reservations for rooms you can’t accommodate. Very disappointed.
50,Nice place staff and everything we really enjoy the Mandalay beach pools river and more and we’ll be back very soon we really have a fun slot machines beer and food this is our place for long time ago  Thank you
50,We had possibly the best weather  low 80’s right after a 100 degree week of weather. Cool breezes and a monster hummer limo that carried 30 of the coolest people I know out to wedge wood golf course at its wedding venue. with a fantastic view of the mountains we had a non teaditfriday wedding which was awesome because we got two nights out back at the Mandalay Bay and two day at the best pool resort in vegas! Three pools and a lazy river with cabanas both days our trip couldn’t have been better except maybe for that incredible dinner at the house of blues! WOW! Amazing service all around and genuinely happy people working and playing there! Can’t wait to go again!
50,We’ve been staying at MB for over 10 years at least twice a year. It is beautiful clean comfortable great pool area great restaurants staff is friendly casino floor is spacious and not crowded. The rooms are clean ands beds very comfy
30,Wait for that text to check in after you do mobile check in only to be disappointed when they keep telling you that your room isn’t ready. They want to charge you to check in early but when your room isn’t ready at 3pm do they give you money back? Nope. Sorry just keep waiting. Being told our room wasn’t in the cue over and over and then being directed to wait in a very long line to be told oh you mobile checked in but don’t have a room ready. Beyond frustrating and not how you want to start the trip. We finally got into our room after 4pm. So ridiculous.    The rest of the trip was fun. Bartenders at Rhythm and riffs were awesome Eye candy bar was fun and great music Hazel had good acoustic music each night Foundation room was an experience. Cabana at the pool was expensive but fun! Over all Mandalay Bay is a great place to stay and the tram takes you close to the happening parts of the strip without walking too much.
50,We chose to do the mobile checkin so we got to skip the line at the front. Our room was very nice and clean. The beds were so comfortable you literally just melted into them. The staff at the pools and front desk were very friendly! I was pretty impressed with everything!
30,Keycards don’t work right staff even owns up to it and shrugs it off so every trip on the elevator was a fight to attempt to get to my floor by day 5 I was honestly about to just check out and pay for a room in another hotel. The room is very spacious and was about 4/5 for cleanliness. Customer service was a hard zero - and again by day 4/5 I just stopped tipping. Because it is literally expected that you tip everywhere but they don’t even smile at you and act irritated if you happen to have questions. Every single thing costs extra on top of the inflated room rate. Everything smells like pot or cigarette smoke you literally cannot get away from it. Lesson learned don’t bother spending more on a room to expect better. My brother staid at Excalibur for 1/4 of the cost and the only bonus we had was the larger room size - but the fight to get to the room with the elevator just ruins the day. We picked Mandalay for the pools because we brought our teenager with us but the pools were so crowded it was hard to move around and the lazy river was packed with adults not wanting their beer to get wet - that there was no regard for whether they plowed a kid over to get to the side to save the alcohol that wasn’t even allowed in there to begin with but the lifeguards don’t seem to enforce anything so it’s just a giant free for all. Basic summary- save the money in the hotel room go cheaper and more basic. There was literally no additional benefit to a nicer larger room when you are hardly ever in it.
20,This is my first negative review ever. I am in the hospitality industry for over 30 years so I have always left positive reviews but this time I can't. We have been staying at Mandalay Bay for the past 20 years for a girls annual trip. Have had some of the best times of our lives here. I was actually in the hotel when the horrible shooting happened and was so impressed with how they treated their guests that were locked down. With covid missed the last 2 years but made it back in May of 2022. The entire resort needs to be renovated. My suite had wallpaper missing/falling off the walls Cigarette butts everywhere dirty glasses outside and not cleaned up the entire 6 days of our stay Tiles missing on the wall of the wave pool. You couldn't walk outside without getting hit in the face with marijuana. Buffet Restaurant closed so very few options. This was defintely NOT the Mandalay Bay I fell in love with
10,We booked a room several months in advance with a wedding block. I called and advised the front desk that we would be checking in late. They made a note in our account and still gave our room away. We did not get the room we booked and instead got a handicap-accessible room that had closets that were not tall enough to hang my dresses in for the wedding events. We called as soon as we discovered our room wasn't correct. They said there was nothing they could do other than offer us a credit for food and beverages and *maybe* the room we booked would become available the next night... which was a Saturday- very unlikely. They never called us the next day to tell us either way and I think the better business bureau will be receiving a complaint. What is the point of booking anything and paying a deposit if it doesn't mean you will get what you booked?
50,This was my first stay at Mandalay. Besides it being on the far end of the strip (I normally stay at the center of strip) it was super nice. Rooms were large and comfortable. The tram made it easy to get to Luxor Excalibur and short walk to New York New York. The casino was super clean and hardly any smoke smell. We will stay again! I am a diamond member at Caeser's and enjoyed this stay as much or more than some of my others!
50,My family attended my son’s wedding and everyone there was so nice and accommodating! We were given adjoining rooms with my daughter and her family which made it easy to help with the grandkids. We were both given complimentary mini fridges for the baby’s bottles and one for us for our medications that had to stay refrigerated. The chapel staff were excellent and the wedding was beautiful! Self parking was easy and we were able to shop swim gamble etc all right in the hotel.
50,We enjoyed Mandalay Bay quite a bit. It was on the quiet side which I appreciated at my age. Plenty of fun to be had but at a nice an easy pace. Just busy enough to be entertaining but not too crowded. Spread out casino floor and tons of food choices. Great stay.
10,Room was next to service elevator and noisy. Could not sleep well at all. I was also charged an early check in fee of $40.00 with a $5.35 tax on the early check in when I did not check in early. Also never advised about the $26.00 Valet charge per day by the parking staff and there was no signage to the fact. When I called to complaint Rep was rude to me.
50,7 nights of Vacation stay at Mandalay Bay was Absolutely Awesome! From Check in to when we left was more than we could have asked for! 2 Bedroom Suite was Phenomenal! My Wife & Daughter didn’t want to leave!
20,The food court at Mandalay messed me up for my entire trip. For this reason alone I'm not coming back. I don't know if I can trust any of the restaurants.  The elevators were very frustrating to operate and most times I would instead take the stairs after exiting with a random floor with a stranger.
30,This property is beautiful. The pool is amazing. Do not touch the refrigerator unless you want to get charged for it. We got charged $50 for putting our medicine in it for 30 minutes. And we must have moved two drinks in there enough to activate the sensor and they charged us another $22.
50,"If you dont' mind that you're basically at the end of the strip it's a nice big hotel/casino. I've stayed at almost every property on the strip multiple times over and I really like the room and especially the pool. I just wish you could move the hotel to be more in a central location so I didn't need to drive over there.    We did have issues with the keys and I think they were unstaffed and it took a long time to stand in line to get things resolved. I had to stand in the line 3 times despite being a ""VIP"" guest."
50,Girlfriend and I stayed here for EDC weekend loved staying here. Staff is very friendly and helpful room was clean bed was comfy. Only small gripe is using the app to scan in the elevator to get to your floor it doesn't always scan other guests in the elevator were having the same issue. Ended up getting a physical key at the front desk and had no issues.
50,This was a great experience for me. Have stayed at Excalibur and Wynn previously. I enjoyed this trip the most. Friendly staff that never made us feel uncomfortable great room with a bed that slept cool and a nice relaxing comfortable bathroom. 10/10 would stay here again. Had a pool view that made me feel like I was on a Mexican resort. Highly suggest staying here. Worth the price! A closer CVS would help but at the end of the day that's barely an inconvenience with the closest one being about 1 mile away.
40,Went here for EDC weekend of 2022. Went here with a total of 8 people including myself. I wanted to book multiple rooms because we would be staying for 4 days and 3 nights but I wasn't able to get the second room with a little bit more discount. But overall the stay was great. Nice rooms for what I paid for and the staff was friendly as always. Will be coming here again.
30,Check in was horribly slow and our room wasn't ready but once we got into our room the Resort was pretty good. Pool and lazy river were fantastic. Definitely worth it to rent a cabana for the shade and poolside service. Being at the end of the strip is a bit of a pain but taxi/Uber were easy and cheap and there is also a free tram from the hotel.
50,My visit was for a software conference and the venue was excellent for our needs. There were more than ample options for food drink social spots and entertainment. The check-in was smooth thanks to Maria who helped me with mobile-check-in. The overall experience is something I look forward to repeat on my next visit to LV.
30,Nice room/ view and bed was really comfortable but customer service was poor. Was told late checkout was not an option had to be out by 11. Room service told us to “leave a note” to have linens changed. Hotel is on the far end of strip
50,I was here on a business trip and had the pleasure of having a wonderful lady assist me with my check-in. I am 20 years old and don’t meet the minimum age to check-in but given the circumstances I needed to stay there since that’s where my company was needing me to stay. With that being said the lovely lady then requested clearance from a supervisor/manager to find out how we could create a solution for the matter. Long story short she was able to help me out and had me checked in in 10 minutes! I will definitely be looking forward to being back next year for the year-round event my company has in Vegas!
10,Way overpriced for what you get. It’s not any nicer than the cheaper hotels. Our room wasn’t completely cleaned (there was a used washcloth in the tub a water bottle and hat between the nightstand and bed and a big spill on the nightstand). I asked for a mini fridge but was not told in advance it was $35 a night. We could have bought a mini fridge for the price we were going to be charged. We’ve stayed in cheaper hotels on the strip that came with the fridge included. There is almost no cider on site (and none at at pool) seltzer is not the same thing. Makes it hard for people with gluten allergies. Our room was ready early but the elevator wouldn’t accept our key until 3. Since your key only lets you get your floor when 6 people get on there’s a desperate dash with everyone trying to swipe their key and get their floor. Additionally my friend on 9 couldn’t get to our room on 11 to hang out before we went out.    It’s the furthest south you can get on the strip so going anywhere requires a lot of walking. There’s a tram but it shuts off at midnight so if you’re doing Vegas right expect to make the long walk back.    Even though it was dirty we didn’t ask them to come clean it. We just moved the stuff that was missed. They’d probably charge us for extra cleaning since everything else was nickel and dimed. My friend had one water from the top of the minibar and they charged her $22/night.
30,Though my experience was not ideal. Overall the hotel was amazing and operated very efficiently. Had my check in been executed properly I would have rated this casino 5 stars. The valet was very quick in providing your vehicle. The staff all around was very pleasant and attentive to us during our stay. The location was perfect and the hotel smells amazing all day long. The casino has a ton of really fun games and the food selections on grounds were to die for.
50,My son and I had a wonderful stay. We will definitely be back. The pool was the main attraction for us as my son is 13 years old. Great service in every other area too. Great restaurants and staff available to answer any and all questions. Our only issue was that our room was one that had a connecting door to a different room and you could hear everything they said & did.
10,Too expensive for what it has to offer the hotel was way too far from the strip the main attraction was the pool but even that was operated you could swim because the life guards would be whistling to get back behind the line then you couldn't be on the shallow side because they would be pushing you to get past the other blue line even the lazy river was overrated since you had to buy a 30 dollar tube
50,This is where you wanna vacation for a little bit of all types of entertainment! The beach 🏖was phenomenal wasn’t over crowded due to EDC event! The food from Citizens never disappointed me! Will be back with friends or family next trip!
40,The casino is too off the strip and only thing we loved about this casino was the beach resort pool. The buffet was closed and the cirque de soleiI was also closed at this time. Everything is very overpriced and not very accommodating to guests.
50,Really happy with the service we received. The hotel and casino was very well kept the shops were great. We loved the time we spent at the pool. Service at the pool was excellent as well. We really look forward to another trip in the future.
50,This is the first time I stayed at the Mandalay. I rarely stay more than once at the same hotel just because I want to experience a lot of different places. This is definitely a place I would stay again. It’s centrally located to all the hotels that I wanted to go to beautiful and a good size room.
50,Fantastic room hotel had everything needed for our weekend and so much to explore. Being at the end of the strip was easy access to the highway for us getting to edc. The pools were amazing and had so many options various restaurants to explore.
30,Great rooms and beautiful hotel. We had our two young children with us and this is not a place for them. The pool area is not adequate for a family there's tons of trash all around the pool and lazy river no arcade either. Also it seems to attract a high number of people smoking marijuana which was overly present inside and outside the property.
30,Everything is three times as much as it was 2 years ago.  Parking is not free even if you are staying at any mgm hotel.  The food cost has exploded.  Cleanliness is has dropped as well.  For example… 30 dollars for a tube to ride the lazy river…..outrageous
50,Moorea topless pool was a blast ! All ages sizes- great vibe !  Restaurants amazing ! Strip Steak- best Wagyu filet & brussel sprouts ever !  Libertine Social - unreal cheeseburger & BLT salad  Front desk very helpful & thoughtful- affordable upgrade & free champagne toast 4 my bday
30,We were told we could check in early prior to booking our room. We booked and then they said the room was unavailable and to give them 30 minutes because the room was dirty and being cleaned. We ended up having to wait 6 hours. 6 whole hours.
50,Best experience of my life good customer service clean rooms nice view of the strip friendly staff pool area is awesome it also has a wave pool love it drinks are really good food delicious over all an excellent experience.
50,This was an awesome resort to stay at. The rooms were very clean and tidy. The resort itself is very clean and bright. The casino floor is connected with Delano and Four Seasons. On top of that its also connected to Luxor so you can walk there. Staff is very friendly and helped us with all our questions.
50,The property is what I expected with the amazing pool! They could communicate a bit better but the app check-in process was seamless. Too bad the phone key doesn't work well. Casino is beautiful.  Fun fun
20,Walls are extremely thin so be prepared to heat whatever your neighbor is doing disgusting . There will be something broken just find it or you will be blamed . Keep all recipes because they will lie .
40,Mini bar only in room additional fridge at extra charge only one trash can in room which is in bathroom. Mini bar very sensitive do not touch unless you want to get charge. 90% of staff was friendly
50,Fun place beautiful inside and out. Friendly timely staff. Great food! We would do it all over again but maybe add a few more days. Rooms were so cozy especially after long nights out on Las Vegas Blvd
20,Sold my reserved room. Got an oh well. I wasn't even close to late. Regular check in time. Casino host was rude and told me oh well on another issue. I could go on and on but... obviously they don't care. Oh... and we come to Vegas 4 times A year. Never had a bad stay until Mandalay Bay.
40,Room was very clean and fresh. However I can hear all the noises of outside of hallways. When I checked out it’s complicated then I thought. I been waiting for 15mins. But overall it wasn’t too bad.
30,Changes to the Mlife rewards program is making it much harder to reach whatever rewards level you are hoping to attain. Also there was no clock in our room the iron didn't work and the shower handle was falling off.
30,Check in staff was not very informative getting my players card was Very long and they never said I could take my rewards from my room stay. Very poor management  Resort fees are ridiculous another way to get money from their customers  Not coming back to Vegas again  I will go out of my way to tell people don’t go to Vegas  take a cruise instead
40,Overall experience was excellent. Only issue we had was with the box office representative. The gal didn’t hide how irritated she was with our inquiries on the shows. When we decided to catch the next MJ One show which was to start in 15 min she huffed loudly and actually made a comment “You’re kidding me right?!” Not very professional at all.
50,This was my first stay here and my 5th time to a hotel on the strip. I booked it for the pool experience.  The hotel itself is in beautiful condition and sparkling clean. The room is clean and quiet love the floor to ceiling windows and the bed is super comfy with nice linens.  The pool is incredible and clean and the service from the staff is very good and all with a SMILE all day long. And these people are SO busy! The washrooms were being cleaned constantly and walkways swept and towels cleaned up and and and... There are plenty of chairs (that don't cost) and a bunch that do if you want to be front row to the pool. It's expensive but not more than anywhere else in Vegas. We brought our own tubes to float the lazy river and loved it ! and gave the tubes to some happy kids on leaving. We brought a few of our own drinks in I think they just don't want any glass brought in as they do check your bags.    Everyone in the hotel staff that we came in contact with was friendly and greeted us and asked if we needed anything.    Starbucks in the casino is a huge plus and a convenience store with sandwiches if you need something on the go.    Its at the end of the strip but the tram is great or take the strip express bus or an Uber - doesn't matter where you stay in Vegas you are happily exhausted by the end.  I will definitely stay here again and again especially in pool season.  Just going to say one more time that everyone we came into contact with from room attendants to store clerks in the hotel pool attendants pool waitresses snack bar waiters hostesses check-in staff -- were all so friendly and greeted us even though they were all very busy. Give them kindness they work so hard in that hotel and in that city.  Thank you Mandalay Bay we will be back!!
50,Good hotel but staffs won’t give late check out. Asked if I could check out at 1pm instead or 11am they said no. Had to go sit at the airport for over 5 hours.  Overall experience wasn’t bad. We had fun would stay at this hotel again
50,This room was amazing. I love the view of the pool from the room. The pool is awesome. The only problem that I had was the digital room keys didn’t work on the elevator nor the room door. I went to iPad and reg cards still didn’t work
50,What a wonderful stay! Mandalay Bay was perfect for my family to use as a base to travel around Vegas. The resort restaurants are amazing - especially Border Grill’s brunch on Sundays. It’s easy to overlook in a city like this but soooo delicious.
10,No matter the service or facilities no one should charge 22USD for a water bottle period. The weather AC and alcohol means you are more likely to be dehydrated and if you have to pay 22USD for a 1usd water bottle then you will be constantly uncomfortable throughout your stay.
50,I stayed at Mandalay Bay when it first opened. Returning this trip I was pleasantly surprised at how well it has been kept up. Still felt new. They still have a great selection of restaurants so you really don't have to leave unless you want to.
50,Ever since I started staying here I don't think I would stay at another hotel! Great for a family trip couples getaway and even with friends! The beach/ pool area is so fun ! And let's not forget the lazy river! Love it !
50,This was a much needed getaway. The rooms pool and amenities were perfect. I’ll be coming back again. This was my 3rd stay at Mandalay Bay. The staff is super friendly and the hotel is clean. I can’t wait to go back.
30,Was not impressed with the lack of service. On the casino floor servers were extremely scarce and if you could find one it would take over 30 mins for them to return. Cabanas were nothing special and Mlife offers were disappointing.
50,Took my nephew for his 21st birthday and had a great time. Staff was friendly and helpful rooms were nice and food was great. Had a great time at the pool and lazy river. Would definitely recommend this resort.
50,MB has to have some of the most AWESOME staff and management teams around they put other MGM resorts to shame. We had a small issue with our room and they took care of it right away definitely my best stay in Vegas yet and this is the 3rd time I have stayed at this property 5th if you count Delano which is attached...
50,2nd time staying at Mandalay Bay and it was even better than the first! We invited friends to come stay in our 2 bedroom king suite (panoramic view) and it was a blast! Well appointed suite with great views and amenities. We had breakfast at House of Blues each morning (BEST SERVICE IN VEGAS) and it never disappoints. Had dinners at The Pub and Fleur. Both were great.
40,Great hospitality and spacious rooms however room walls are extremely thin. A lot of noise disturbance at 2/3am in the morning making it difficult to sleep 2/3 nights. Plenty of great restaurant options and bars throughout the resort. Great beach club inside as well.
10,If you’re planning a vacation in or around Las Vegas Nevada DO NOT book your stay at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. Choose anywhere else than the Mandalay Bay. It may look nice on the outside but when it comes to the rooms guest services and housekeeping Mandalay Bay is absolute garbage!    You would think that coming out of a pandemic they would ensure cleanliness?!    You would think that guest services would want to make it right?!    You would think that you would be able to use the refrigerator that’s in your room?    Wrong if you put anything in there it’s a $50 charge. Then everyday that we were there we had a random $10 charge billed to the room from the fridge even though we didn’t touch anything in it.    When I brought it up to guest services about the room being disgusting and filthy they wanted to argue and debate with me then doubled down and said well do you have pictures. When I brought up the random charges they wanted to debate them.  So here you go Mandalay Bay here are your pictures!    Again I don’t recommend staying with Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.
30,The establishment and amenities are wonderful. I wish the lobby staff at the lobby desk was a little more helpful. I wasn’t able to check in until hours after I potentially could have because the person helping me didn’t want to answer my questions.    Safety was also a concern as while waiting in the designated Uber/taxi pick up lobby I was approached by a homeless man. It was extremely uncomfortable and scary as he attempted to get very close to me and my belongings. As a young woman I did not feel safe. There was no attendants in the area at the time. I’d definitely recommend having an attendant at all the doors to ensure safety of the guest.
40,Mandalay is a huge hotel! So many things to do and the rooms were decent. No fridge or microwave but great AC! Shower is a little small but there’s also a bathtub! This is great for a girls night out and splitting costs.
30,Great pools our room was spacious & very clean. Everything you want or need during your trip was accessible. We had a great time at the Shark Reef exhibit! Downside-employees were not friendly nor helpful. They definitely need to step up their customer service.
30,It was nice enjoyed the pool area and room was clean. However if you're a casino resort you should have free shuttle service to and from the airport (especially when you're spending money at the casino).
40,This is a good place at a reasonable price. Comfortable rooms good location on the south end of Las Vegas Blvd.; convenient tram service to Luxor & Excalibur and easy to get to New York/New York MGM Grand or Park MGM from there. Wave pool / beach club are outstanding. The bad - no refrigerator in the room for personal use (it's only for the obscenely expensive minibar); no robes provided; wi-fi was weak. Still definitely worthy of your consideration. Have stayed here twice and would do so again.
40,Our stay was nice but there was nothing spectacular that justified the price we paid for two nights.  The staff was friendly and helpful. Don't bring any leftovers home from restaurants though because there is no refrigerator for personal use.  The Citizens restaurant was amazing though we went there two times!
10,Shower wouldn’t drain 50 minute wait in rewards line room cleaning had to be on their schedule- every excuse was “lack of staff”- which may be true but their is no price break to match their poor service level.
40,Navigating the hotel was fairly easy and the views were wonderful. The free tram came in handy and the beach/pool area has ample seating and was quite enjoyable. The rooms could have been cleaned a bit more thoroughly and the elevator was easily heard but was easy to tone out.
40,- Casino was good spacy and good lighting  - Hotel is nice  - rooms are spacious but outdated  - Service was great  - Shops in the Hotel are all overpriced  - Pool closed a 6:00 pm😫  - East Pool Area with Cabanas closed during the week after Holiday ? Why ?
50,First time staying here & I’ll definitely be booking here in the future! The front desk staff was so friendly and helpful by letting us check-in early. It’s great to know that guests are offered a discount for the Michael Jackson ONE show & the pool area is amazing!
10,My property was stolen out of my hotel room by house keeping the hotel claimed my items would be turned in to lost & found and I never received my item or compensation for my items I was given them run around by staff and now it’s under investigation
50,We love the location and hotel! Always top notch and they solve any problems fast. Stayed only 2 nights but had a blast! Parking was a breeze and we used it on other mgm properties having the key card and parking pass on phone is a real bonus
10,Don’t normally right reviews but we didn’t have a pleasant stay. We went for a festival and I requested early check in the gentleman was very rude when I tried checking in. The bell desk was as well rude. We felt as is all the employees were in such a bad mood.
50,Staff is amazing and all accommodation were clean and entertaining! Had a great time with a group of friends in town for a long weekend! Stayed multiple places in Vegas as this is one of our favorites!
40,Hotel is very nice but watch out for middle  Of the night early morning maintenance if you have an early flight. They will turn off the water. Other than than nice hotel and the pool was very nice..
50,The location was perfect with everything within the complex. The pools were awesome and the variety made it great for singles couples and families. I personally do not gamble but this destination has something for everyone.
20,Not impressed. One good meal two bad ones. Charging $50 a day to use the mini frig is ridiculous! Food and drink prices are outrageous. Smells like cigarette smoke. Beds were comfy with good pillows. Pool area is crowded and much smaller than it looks in the pics. Overall YUK!
50,Great hotel and casino. Clean and well kept. Good food in area. Access via hotel tram makes it easy to get to several other casinos. The pools are great. Good food and drinks are available. The chicken strips are fantastic. Plenty of space and many different pools including a wave pool and lazy river.
10,There was a water leak in my room that soaked the carpet and the bottoms of my leather soled shoes. Mobile key did not work in the elevators. Check in desk had a line of at least 20 people with just two registers open.
50,Mandalay Bay will not disappoint. Staff and rooms were great. Pool area is amazing. Shark Rief was awesome. Restaurants were great.  Gaming was fantastic and not too busy. Easy walk inside or out to Luxor and Excalibur. Both worth checking out. Will stay here again.
50,I can’t wait to come back! Give me a reason to come back to Vegas and stay here because I will be their in a heart beat. Next time I need to stay in a suite so that I really can get the full experience :)
50,The room was nice and clean. Love the bed I slept like a baby. Mini fridge was fridge napped by the hotel can’t put any personal items inside 😒 other than everything else was perfect. My booking agency did an awesome job.
40,Not the fanciest or newest but Mandalay Bay has it all for an easy on-site weekend. Loads of food choices (go the the Mandalay Mall if you want casual) great pool and although the cabana was a splurge if you have a group do it - service was wonderful in the west lagoon area and allowed us to use the pool all day because of the shade of the cabana. Use the gym free of charge in the spa all you have to do is check in at the desk. With a service you have access to the day spa services all day - even with only a mani or pedi.  Great live music in multiple places in the evenings.  Only downside is the amount of smoking in casino is definitely noticeable and generally there is no sensitivity by patrons regarding smoking.
10,First we where assigned a room that was occupied by another couple. So I went down to the lobby and they gave us another room 29-315 and I asked them why they gave us a room that was occupied and they said they don’t know what happened. In room 29-315 the ice machine on floor 29 wasn’t working and sheets were not changed on room cause they were foot prints all over them and when I went to the toilet there was pubic hair on toilet seat. So I went back to the lobby for the 2nd time and explained the situation and they apologized and gave us a different room 29-119 since I’m a gold member status I asked for a room upgrade (good view). And on room 29-119 the view is NOT an upgraded view. My wife said that it was enough going back and forth to lobby so we stayed in that room but I wasn’t happy. The day I checked out I commented to the lobby girl what was the situation we went thru. And she said to go to MGM rewards desk and ask for a discount for the situation that happened to us. So did go to rewards desk and explained all the situation and the lady there was NO record of us changing rooms and she was rude and said there’s nothing I can do for you. The only thing she said she can do for me to s to give me a free parking to get out of the parking lot. ( Ticket that I tried to use and it did NOT work at the parking machine).  Thanks Mandalay Bay for a Great Weekend!!
40,Overall the stay was fine rooms were clean and the food was ok. The digital key didn’t work which sucked. The tables sucked completely. They had two open baccarat tables and only one active while the other one had a dealer sitting and waiting with the cards ready but was “reserved” so they refused to open it and left only one table to play despite it being full and other people were waiting from behind to play and betting from behind to play….horrible.
50,Our stay was great. We love staying at Mandalay due to the cleanliness of their rooms the amazing view of the strip the pools are amazing specifically if you get a cabana or gazebo. The staff our always friendly and helpful as well.
50,The accommodations and staff always go above and beyond. We always feel very welcomed when we arrive. The rooms are always very clean and it’s nice to know that they are always trying to improve with upgraded rooms.
20,with room and resort fee the hotel was easily 300 a day. The only amenity was internet. No coffee pool only open on weekends until 4. the lazy river requires you to RENT a tube- they don't even provide one. They nickle and dime you to death. Location was at end of strip so not very conenient.
50,We stayed here as a group of seven for a bachelorette party. It was clean tasteful spacious and everyone was very friendly. We loved the foundation room and our guest rooms were spacious clean and comfortable. We enjoyed our time at the pool as well!
20,The staff is exceptional. The Beach is great. The Hotel has lots of little things broken and is kind of dirty. This hotel is very close to the airport and not quiet at all all night long. Generally found the stay to be unplesant elevators broken which is always scary
10,Would not stay here. Location is horrible. Casino is dirty. Rooms are worse. Sitting at Hazel bar ignored by waitress only working one side. Just a joke.    The regular pool is nice. Daylight beach club is less than classless. First couple hours are ok but than they way oversell that venue and it’s gross. The pool water is just straight urine. Gross.
50,Just wanted to share some wonderful experiences we had with the Concierge team at Mandalay Bay. My partner and I decided to have a weekend trip together to Vegas. It wasn’t a planned trip so had to make a last minute plan to book our room while making reservation for the show we have been wanting to watch—Michael Jackson One show!! Since we were in a hurry we weren’t able to see all the promotions when we booked but later we found out about 15% discount promotion that was going on. Basically if you stay at the resort and buy the show tickets they give you discount.    Once we arrived at the resort we decided to ask about the promotion. Ticket booth representative was not interested in helping us as we already purchased the ticket. As we needed some recommendations for fine dining we decided to drop by the concierge for some tips. As we met a very nice concierge named Tamira we decided to ask about the promotion we missed. She couldn’t find the promotion we saw but she was very empathetic and went up above and beyond to take care of our needs. She made a couple of phone calls using our ticket numbers and decided to give us credit for dining.    The monetary amount is not a lot but she definitely knows how to make a clients’ day. Her superb care for clients and sincere manner were excellent. Unfortunately one of the restaurant decided not to give us the full credit she gave us. In the morning we made a quick phone call to the concierge team and this time CJ answered the phone. He was again more than willing to help us and addressed the issue. Oh my the concierge team at Mandalay Bay is the picture of excellence! Kudos to the team!! I have stayed at many hotels but this concierge is one of the best for sure. Because of them we had a great experience at Mandalay Bay and can’t wait to go back. Thank you Tamira and CJ. We will be coming back to Mandalay Bay because of your great service!! Great work and thank you guys!!
50,Great service place was exceptional clean and nice. Everything was sparkling clean. All staff was helpful and nice. I don't even recall calling front desk for any assistance never needed anything it was perfect
30,All I see is GREED from MGM - After the resort fee that gets you zero only to find out we are being nickled & dimed to death. Seriously for $300 - $400 a night basic room + Resort FEE it should at minimum come with coffee and free parking. I would also expect the room to be clean but apparently that is too much to wish for. Also according to the front-desk staff if you're really high up the view of the freeway & parking garage is something special.
50,I love my first experience in Las Vegas. It was a pretty good experience for me and my wife staying at the hotel. It was unconventional to see that the refrigerator was full but extremely expensive. The only problem we encountered was the mobile app in the elevator which did not work all the time. But overall we were absolutely satisfied.
30,The room and property (pool system) were wonderful. Beds comfortable and fun pool day with my daughter and wife but the check in left a horrible taste in my mouth. Over the course of an hour I checked in on the mobile app waited in the general check in line was pulled out of the main line sent to the mobile check in line waited there check in didn’t work stepped out of this line a worker with an iPad attempted to look my reservation up but she told me that the “system hasn’t Assigned you a room yet so you can wait until it does or get back in the main line” I got back in the main line then the original worker who pulled me out and sent me to the mobile line pulled me out AGAIN saying she would take my name and get me a room personally. She walked away and came back five to ten mins later without a room. She said that it was my phone causing issues and I must not be connected to the hotel wifi which was making the app not refresh she fiddled with my settings (didn’t get it to work) then finally sent me to another line (another mobile check in but this time with a human) and I waited in line for the next worker to hear me. She politely smiled and nodded and got me a room. I’m not looking for an upgrade and I didn’t ask for one but I was super annoyed to not get an apology or an acknowledgment of frustration from ANYONE. All of this was done with my four year old by my side. Ugh. My room was clean and updated. After a long day of travel ( we had been camping previously) we decided to do carry out from one of the properties restaurants (citizens) but when I arrived back up at the room I saw that there was no chocolate milk for my daughter ($7) nor was there syrup or butter for my chicken and waffles. Dry waffle with chicken on top. Ugh. I walked back downstairs from our room to trek back to the restaurant for the items. At least the restaurant staff was apologetic. The pool system was great but the four year old wasn’t tall enough for the wave pool (which guidelines were not listed online- another surprise) so we had to stick to the regular pool and the lazy river. All in all we decided to forgo our normal hotel chain membership for the Mandalay Bay’s pool system and supposed unmatched service. Yet I know that I’ll not be in any sort of a hurry to pay more money for a lazy river when we can get a nice pool in any other hotel.
30,Bed not comfortable. Need get the book or information for using items in the room (not in refrigerator).  Charge bill check out different with in credit card. Towels is not look clean to me . Room so lousy voice( my view cross the street form airport.
40,One great meal at HOB went back next night for same meal it was so good. It was horrible the next night and manager didn’t care that it was $250 and I left hungry it was so bad. Had steak that was amazing so were the brussel sprouts and garlic potatoes along w the bread pudding. Horrible the second night.
50,Staff was the best in Vegas. Most diverse dining on property. Spacious. This place offers the most restaurants and attractions on one property. I will be staying here again. I highly reccommend. If u visit this place is a home run!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
50,17th floor king strip view room. Clean great view of strip clean comfortable bed and it had a shower and a wonderful deep tub :)  Highly recommend.  The only thing that was slightly negative was it is a harder overall casino layout and room elevators are hidden
50,It’s a beautiful property and extremely clean. Only issue I had was my door would not close unless it was slammed shut. I would make sure to pull your room door tight shut when opening it. I’m sure it drove other guest next to nuts to hear that door being slammed shut.
10,This has been my ninth stay at Mandalay Bay including stays at Delano (At the time it was called “The Hotel”) and Four Seasons. I had never experienced the feeling of insecurity dirty and lack of service and personalized attention.    When I got to my room there was a stain on the sheet really disgusting and the shower wall with hair from previous guests and green plaster on the bathroom wall. the towels were dirty and very thin. I notified housekeeping and they didn't care.    At 1:30 AM someone knocked on my door it was a drunk man who claimed to be lost 40 minutes later he was still outside my room I took pictures and called the hotel police who saw it as normal. When checking out I wanted to talk to the manager about it and without saying anything she withdrew the resort fee as if that was going to make up for what happened. It is a pity that the quality of cleanliness service and security fell (which is not a luxury and in this hotel the worst massacre in the history of the USA has happened)
40,A good place to stay if you like everything in one place. Nice restaurants. Great entertainment. Nice pool. Limited selection of table games in the casino though. Accessing the strip is easy with the tram just time consuming
40,Mind you we walked the Strip halfway with the kids. We parked at the Fashion Mall and walked to Mandalay Bay for the Shark Reef exhibit. Upon entering the casino I thought it was beautiful. Very ornate and full of shops and restaurants.
40,My husband and I just got back from a trip to Vegas. We really enjoyed staying at the Mandalay bay the only downfall is that it’s so far away from the busiest part of the strip. We aren’t big gamblers but loved lounging by the pool and the beach. Drinks and food are very pricey bottled water is over six dollars but experience is worth it. Overall the staff was there doing their job but didn’t seem to go out of their way to acknowledge us. The concierge desk was very helpful and kind when booking shows.
10,If you want a hotel where the concepts of hospitality and customer care are laughed at- well then Mandalay Bay is the place for you.    There literally are NO housekeeping services at this hotel. Beds aren’t made trash isn’t collected and overflows from the only trash bin provided in the room basic sanitary items such as soap shampoo etc. are furnished for one day and then it’s up to you to call for refills And cleaning- that’s simply an item not on the business plan at this hotel. There is no cleaning.    I can’t believe the housekeeping services we received at Mandalay Bay met state of Nevada or local health and sanitary standards. No standards could be that lax.    This was the worst.    Succinctly housekeeping was an absolute disaster- I can’t believe the service provided us met state and local health codes. Our room certainly would not have qualified as decent safe and sanitary.    Even after we called and demanded rudimentary housekeeping on our third day- the room again was ignored fir our final two days.
50,As Las Vegas Locals we always like staycations and we always stay at Mandalay Bay. Best service Restaurants and Pool! It’s easy access to the Pool. Mandalay Place Burger Bar is excellent and we highly recommend it.
50,Staff were so friendly. Rooms were great. Bed was comfortable. It was clean. House keeping always ensured we had everything we needed. They gave great advice and recommendations. Valet were nice and quick
50,Wasn’t expecting to have so much fun at the pool but throw in a couple giant frozen drinks and a lazy river and I was having the time of my life! Everything was so easy and accessible I will definitely be back.
40,Love the lazy river and the beach/pool area! Casino has a lot to offer. Restaurants are open to about 10pm during the week; ahemmm people do get hungry after 10pm JS. Overall. I enjoyed my stay!  Enjoyed the spa services;)
40,I was traveling for a convention. Their convention center is huge seems to have a lot of rooms and the staff and coordination for audio/visual seemed on-point. The staff also kept rooms clean and refreshments readily available. They did not account for my diet requests (that they asked for ahead of time) even when I asked for additional help. I ended up finding other food around the hotel.
40,Nice hotel. Great pool but if it’s hot there are no umbrellas to get under unless you pay for a cabana which is $450 for a day. Hotel is very south end of strip so it’s a hike to mid strip area. Average room in my opinion. Seeing duct tape on areas in the room I didn’t like but ow it was ok. Michael Jackson One played at hotel and it was AMAZING. You can take a skyway to Allegiant arena as well which is nice if you are there for a game. Overall a good Vegas Hotel. For the price the room was ok. Stay here if you want to see a Raiders game or pool is your thing or want to see MJ ONE. Ow stay mid strip is my recommendation
50,My family and I had a great time. It was my 5 year old grandsons first vacation ever and when traveled from the Bay Area. We had a great experience with you guys. Thank you. They treated us like vip the entire time. The pools were beauty and huge. The food was great. Staff was great. Room was very comfortable. Overall we were very happy and will be planning another trip with you guys. Thank you again
50,The whole place is so well kept beautiful and very clean. We loved how spacious the rooms were an all the food options. Our favorite food was House of Blues. All staff we encountered were excellent. Pool side services and drinks were also excellent. We really liked the location as well. Quieter than other places we stayed which we liked! Using the tram was still a convenient quick and best of all free way to get to the strip when we wanted to. Complaint from kids was lack of consistent waves in the wave pool but we still enjoyed all the other pools. Only thing that could've made it better was if they had complimentary coffee in the room. Luckily we were warned when we checked in about the weighted snacks and refrigerator charges so we were able to avoid that. Could see how that would be super frustrating to be charged for slightly touching or moving something and not actually taking or eatting it. Especially when your traveling with young kids. Either way we would definitely recommend it and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
30,Not super clean. Window had tape on it and the wind howled through the tape covering the entire stay.  Someone had room service and their left over food sat outside their room (56-201) for days. Anyone staying in that wing had to go by and smell the rotting eggs and other leftovers that weren’t eaten and it didn’t get removed from the hallway until I tracked someone down and asked for it to be taken away. The smell was terrible.
50,Hotel was super clean and bed super comfy! Casino was awesome and the cocktail ladies super friendly! Definitely going back! It was a Mother’s Day gift to my mom and she was extrema happy with her surprise
20,I enjoyed my stay up until there wasn't any water Thursday night. I had issues in the middle of the night and had no way to clean up. Accommodations were not offered even after asking how to resolve the issue. Tainted an otherwise great trip. Cleaning staff was top notch.
50,Great service. Pit bosses and dealers all were friendly. Nick Gorden was attentive and I am happy to be back. Will return with family again this summer. Late night restauraunts that are open would be a great addition.
50,Came here for a family trip. Rooms were incredible clean spacious bathtub. The pools were great. I would recommend bringing your own inner tube for the lazy River (it costs $30 to buy one there no rentals). But the river is nice and warm.
50,We stayed at the Mandalay bay we were able to travel on the rail car and also we were able to enjoy a cabana on the beach and go to the nightclub for a birthday celebration all in all it was a spectacular trip I will definitely be returning
40,"We stayed at this nice resort at the southern end of the Strip. I didn't gamble so this is really a review of the hotel pool and location.    We arrived at the airport just next to the resort. It took only 10 minutes to get a cab and be dropped off at the hotel only for $20 for the entire family.    We paid for a Strip view room on the 12th floor. The view was great out our floor to ceiling window. The bathroom was spacious and nicely appointed. There was a separate toilet shower and bath. We had two queen sized beds who's pillows were as comfortable as the beds perfect. The only complaint I have of the room is the stocked fridge and a threat that you will be charged if you put anything in it. (of course that depends if you want a stocked fridge or not) There is no microwave oven either.    My family enjoyed the pools the most of anything on the property. They have a number of them. The wave pool simulates an ocean wave every 15 minutes and ends on a sandy beach. The lazy river is a loop with current so you sit in a inner tube and float around. This are is nicely shaded the wave pool is not. There are a few more pools we did not explore I believe they are more adult only oriented.    The grounds are beautiful and in a tropical theme.    The advantage of the hotel's location is that it is the last thing on the strip's south end. This makes it easy to catch ""The Deuce"" bus (before it is full) that is the cheapest way to go from south to the north strip (Fremont experience) before it loops back again. The disadvantage is you are next to the Luxor but that is all. Most of the action is a ways away. If you are going to Allegiant stadium for a Raiders game this hotel is for you. Just walk across the bridge over the highway and you are there.    I WOULD DEFINATELY CONCIDER STAYING HERE AGAIN."
50,Wow! I've enjoyed Mandalay Bay many times but this trip was exceptionally great. Why? It was the warm caring greeting I received from Chandree at the front desk as I told her my sad tale about my recently passed brother. Chandree has a heart of gold that truly blew me away!    My room as always at MB was immaculately clean and well appointed -- and thanks to Chandree it was exactly what I hoped for: high and quiet.    Will I return to Mandalay Bay? That's the safest bet in Las Vegas!
50,We whole family love the hotel it has everything we needed. The pool if fantastic and my granddaughter enjoyed it so much. we are planning to come back. The restaurant and the store by the pool was amazing.
30,The Mandalay Bay is advertised as a nicer hotel along the furthest south point of the strip. It’s big nice looking and has great airflow through the property. We stayed in a “stay well room” paid extra from an air purifier and that was nice to have.  Cons:  After resort fees etc etc etc at over $500 for two nights mid week—- I’d expect to have a AT LEAST a coffee maker. And not one provided at an extra cost. This is ridiculous. We brought our own thankfully.. but most people don’t.    No fridge you can use for the 200++ rate you pay per night the one in room is plugged in and cold. But loaded with nauseatingly over priced booze bottles and if you put anything of your own in there at any point it is a $50 charge. Again a basic commodity in most hotel rooms but not here. So bring an ice chest.    Food on site really this applies to the whole general area. Food is expensive. Like more expensive than Hawaii expensive bring food if you don’t want to spend $30 on some mediocre food.    All mgm hotels have the same lame over priced restaurants peppered in with very expensive more “ high end” restaurants so plan ahead. High end doesn’t exactly mean pleasing to the palate either.    Cleanliness is ok not super clean but not super dirty either. Though our room was not fully cleaned upon check in. We had paid for an early check in then had to wait over an hour for our room to be ready. Then we had to keep calling staff to bring items missing & to clean up the wet bar that had used coffee on it. They did knock off some of our bill but still unprofessional considering the price tag on this place. Details. People. Details. If you can’t accommodate early check ins stop selling them- we left soooo early to get there only to wait.    Staff- they train their staff here to be pretty stuffy the front desk guy was friendly but one of two bell hops we first encountered was rather off putting.    They get a three out of five the aquarium is nice & having the tram available to take us north was also a perk. Next time however we will stay somewhere else.
40,Great place for the family the tram makes it easy to hit the strip. The gap between the strip makes it a little less crazy then the other spots and better for the kids. You can still easily get to the main part of the strip especially by tram. The rooms are clean and secure. Hotel card with room required for access to elevator makes a big difference.
50,Everything about our stay from check-in to check-out was great . Top notch room with great house keeping personal. Casino had everything you needed with plenty of gaming options . There were plenty of food options from fast food to fancy dining and we were always pleased with the food and service we received .  We were always taken care no matter who we were dealing with . We will be back for a stay at Mandalay Bay next time we come to Las Vegas . Thanks M.G.M. for the job your personal do they are all very polite and professional .
50,Staff helpful and above what we expected. Every thing promised was delivered. Hopeless that in the future you will remember us with more comps. If all of your guest are treated with the same welcoming you showed us you will continue to be a sucess.
30,I had to get ice water to keep my Insulin cool because they charge more to use the fridge than the insulin. Other than that the atmosphere (fight weekend) was very flat and was not a fun feeling. Not enough cheering or partying or winning in the Casino. Just a semi-boring atmosphere. Hard to find food after 11pm...very hard.
40,"My wife and I stayed at the Mandalay Bay in the Executive King room with a VIP Package Parking and $50 Food & Beverage Credit.    The room (17-201) was very nice except for noise from the elevators as it was close. The VIP package gives you access to the the VIP Lounge. The Lounge has coffee tea sodas juice and wine. However the only snacks they have are a type of Chex Mix and a few danish. $75 per day fee to access the VIP Lounge is not really worth it.    Although I purchased the $15 per day parking fee in advance the card to go in and out of the garage never worked.    The $50 Food & Beverage credit is sort of a misnomer. Yes they give you $50 credit but only to certain restaurants within the MGM Resort system and typically those restaurants are expensive so you'll spend more money anyway. Additionally they don't tell you that any gratuity in those restaurants are NOT included in the $50. So there's an another charge for that.    The spa: my wife had an 80 minute facial which said was very good. She also said the spa facility was very nice. However I wanted to simply view the men's facility and was told I could not. I had to ""book a service"" in order to just see the men's locker room. Didn't want to use the facility but simply see what it looked like. Even though there was an attendant there who could take 3 minutes and walk me through I was told I could not even after spending $250 for my wife's spa service. Not friendly customer service.    Overall after previously staying at Caesar's Palazzo MGM Grand and Paris... I would rate the Mandalay Bay as middle of the road. Not bad but not great. The facility is clean and the decor is very nice."
50,Came for a work trip and this was my first time in Vegas. I will be back for vacation. All staff that I encountered was great and very friendly. Front desk made sure I had a room ready when I checked in early.
50,We always stay at Mandalay Bay and are there  3 to 4 times per year . The staff is very pleasant  and the rooms are very comfortable and clean.  The clientele is upper class and it is easy access  to the adjoining mall .
50,Every time we stay at Mandalay it is always a pleasure and wonderful experience. The staff are on point courteous and helpful. I brought my friends this time and they are asking when we can do it again.
50,It was an excellent trip. Staff was exceptional. Property was clean. Need a little more tables. Too many machine’s. I prefer the human element. Please don’t add more electronic BJ or craps machines in vegas.
50,I enjoyed my stay but the only issue was the shower head leaking. I didn’t bother to call maintenance knowing it would take quite a while to have someone check on it.  Other than that it was convenient for me.
20,housekeeping was not up to standard and the casino didn’t have poker tournaments any day which they used to and they were closed for two days a week and when they were open they close at two or three in the morning
50,The stay was fabulous the hotel is always nice and the staff are great. My room was a bit dirty. For example there was mold in the shower (or black spots) and dust on the top of the headboards of the beds. The room I stayed in was 30-238 (I think).
50,Great customer service and rooms are always clean. The check in process is a breeze and you usually don't have to wait too long if you check in at registration. The hotel is centrally located and usually my go-to hotel on the strip.
10,Changed reservation to arrive on 4.22.2022. Went to check in and I was told they did not have a room for me. Then after 30 minutes I was told they had a room at a $300.00 rate. I get m life offers all the time for up to 4 COMP nights. I made other arrangements at a non m life hotel and was comped for 2 nights  If you or any of the other team members would like to call me please call at 661.816.4652  Thanks  Michael Levin
50,Would definitely stay there again. Loved that the show we wanted to see was in the same place too and the food was good. My husband was able to play poker there without having to go to another hotel and the fact that our mlife helped us with parking was a plus
50,very quite and clean room no long line elevator. good casino environment. valet  mobile check in & out.  what ever I need I can getting on market. Also tram was good No need long time for move.  thanks everyone. I'll be back again soon.
50,One of my favorite places to stay in Vegas! Every employee in the hotel that I encountered went above and beyond customer service! So friendly kind and helpful. My room was very nice clean and welcoming. The many options of the pool area was amazing to say the least! There were a lot of events happening the week I stayed my only complaint was the elevators! Sometimes you’d ride them up n down if you couldn’t get your floor punched in just right. Other than that I love Mandalay Bay! I look forward to my next trip there!
50,nice clean and comfortable rooms favorable stay a good place we will definitely stay nice clean and comfortable rooms favorable stay a good place without a doubt we will stay again it is recommended for children to be entertained and have a lot of fun
50,We came to Vegas for our nephews wedding. His ceremony was at Delano’s. What a beautiful location for his special day. The views of the Vegas strip were phenomenal and the whole ceremony was amazing. Our stay at Mandalay Bay was perfect. We enjoyed the amazing food and pools offered at this hotel. We will definitely be back.
50,It was a wonderful weekend for my family especially the kids they loved the wave pool and the lazy river like me. For me especially liked the casino floor it was big and very nice slots machine the room was big enough for the family and the service was excellent.
50,Staff was very welcoming and considerate. Lovely room on the 59th floor! Many food options at the resort which made it easier to really relax. Border Grill is phenomenal. The bartenders at Skyfall were also amazing. Spent 4 hours there just chatting with them and having drinks.
50,Had a wonderful stay! Everyone was very friendly room was clean and awesome! Just wish I could have stayed a little longer! Love LOVE the pool! We only experienced one issue and that was we were billed for a coffee from the room that we did not use. After contacting the front desk it was taken off of our invoice.
40,Good stay  Buffet not open ??  Lots going on pool nice  Weather was good always enjoy the stay.  Vehicle parking was a long way from hotel.  Check in was awesome quick friendly and room was very nice.  Will come back
50,Staff welcomed me very graciously with a genuine smile at the rewards entrance. Loved the room and pools.  Had dinner at steakhouse and filet was awesome. Didn’t win any hand pays but still did enough gambling for me.
50,I always have a great time at the Mandalay Bay resort.The staff is very knowledgeable and courteous Rooms are very clean great location they have very excellent choices of restaurants And shopping inside The hotel
30,Beautiful hotel does have a coffee maker in room however it's part of the wet bar with an charge for restocking that would make that a $32 cup of coffee rooms clean and very spacious pool area is absolutely beautiful
40,good stay. has everything you need. walk to pinball hall of fame. tram to Excalibur for easy access to new york new york and mgm grand. beds were comfortable and rooms were clean. separate showers from tubs which I really like.
40,I loved the soaking tub so much I had to go to Lush and get bubble bath. Highly recommend!! Food was fantastic as we ate Steak Grill and Citizens. Citzens has a great quick green smoothie and crustless quiche delicious.
50,I’ve stayed at several properties in Vegas and this is in my top two. The rooms are very spacious and extremely clean. The casino didn’t have a thick smoky smell. I also like that it isn’t located in the congested part of the strip. I will stay again!
20,One shining star employee is Michael at front desk. She is fantabulous and clearly loves his job and the guests The remainder of employees throughout property I came across not very friendly or will lift a finger for guest
50,Front desk staff helpful gave Kim a good work out trying to get me checked in. Another lady did not get her name actually got the details worked out and smooth check-in after that. Room was a Stay Well(?) room. While I am not used to staying on the 59th floor I did enjoy the view was able to sit and watch the strip as well as the activity at the airport when I had down time. Stayed for four nites for a convention and I would certainly recommend sneakers if you attend a convention as there is a tremendous amount of walking. Spent time and $$ at Hazel Lounge and the bar staff were great. Ryan took a couple of pictures of me with a celebrity. Wasn't that keen on the house sauvvy blanc but okay the beer was cold. Spent some $$ at Starbucks staff were great. Wish I could say the same for staff member L**** at Johnny Rockets she did not present well with her attitude. Spent some $$ at the pizza place next to Johnny Rockets as well. Caution: beware of mini-bar prices. I am however proud of myself that I didn't touch a slot machine. Not impressed they look like video games and I like the old fashioned ones that I hear are at Fremont Street but didn't have time to visit. Highly recommend the hotel staff great pricey beers but it is Las Vegas afterall.
50,We had a great stay everyone was so nice and helpful specially housekeeping they make sure our room was clean and ready for us every day. Room was beautiful decorated and comfortable definitely great place to stay whether your coming for pleasure or business.
50,Everything in one place...you really have no reason to leave! I stayed for a convention that was held there. All of the staff was kind and courteous. I showed up early before check-in time after a long and early morning of flying and was accommodated in a timely manner which was very much appreciated! I will definitely return and stay there again on my next visit!
50,service was never anything but normal. The banquet staff was amazing. Front desk was always blah no descriptions or explanations at check in. location is off the strip extremely over priced stores in the hotel. Starbucks was outrageous and service minimal. the rooms were clean and the casino and public areas always clean.
10,hotel charged me for the coffee that i did not purchased. there was no coffee cups i went for the choice convention. service was very bad. i did not get any room service and i paid more than $1000.00 for 4 night stay and did not get the service I should get.
40,This Hotel still offers one of the best rooms in Vegas and also an incredible Sandy Beach Pool. Unfortunately this last trip the room was not clean on arrival and the beach walks were not cleaned either. We were locked out of our room 3x due to a defective door-lock as well the elevator keys only worked 50% of the time having to change elevators often. Staff as usual was great but we may have to change hotels next time due to an obvious lowering of maintenance standard at this usually our favorite hotel.
50,Everything from the many pools which are heated to the food to the incredible customer service was fantastic. Kids had so much fun. Clean rooms staff very attentive. Even the beds/pillows were comfortable! Bathrooms were huge. View of the pools from the room were unbelievable. Rooms are quiet which was surprising. Fun watching planes take off in the morning too!
40,Was a nice resort but the prices were high. No deals to be had anywhere. Was expecting the hallways by the rooms to be cleaner was always garbage laying around. The pool options were nice but don’t go in the summer because the shade options came at a very high price and the sun is quite intense. Was great for a family trip But if my husband and I had gone alone we would’ve stayed somewhere else.
40,Good hotel to stay. Food selection was average . Little bit Distance from main strip. Clean and rooms were spacious . Love to comeback. Hotels rooms to beach have some walk. Nice beach pools wave pools.
50,Beautiful hotel. Very impressed with room and bathroom! Love the stand-alone huge bathtub. Thought it was very silly you had to pay a fee to use the fridge in room and didn't really get any warning that it was an additional cost. Air quality in casino was way better than the rest of the casinos and hotels we visited. Don't love that the pool closes at 6pm. If I had brought by daughter that would have been very disappointing for her.
50,We were in for a convention and came a few days early to relax and enjoy the weather -- we enjoyed the hotel and the amenities. Our King Room was perfect for the two of us and with a desk where I could work from without closing down and putting away. All staff were very friendly that we encountered. The convention center is close by and convenient. This was not our first stay for this conference over the years. Always a great stay!
50,Resort was as expected. Great resort and the pool area is amazing.  Even let you poor your beverage in a Mandalay cup when entering the pool area as opposed to having to throw it away. Only drawback was having to rent an in room fridge for an additional cost daily. Other than this everything was fantastic.
50,We love going to this book because Mike P and his team are the most friendly and accurate of any place in Vegas. Even if you are a small player you feel like a king there. They always keep the atmosphere fun and exciting.
50,Friendly staff good prices ample dining choices comfortable beds (and pillows!) it was all positive. We stayed in the base rooms for a business trip and it was adequate for all three of us sharing the room. I'm sure an upgrade would have been a lot nicer but we were satisfied. The water park and beach club included with the reservation would bring me back to this property. Friendly staff also made the trip.
50,Very family friendly and so much to do. The hotel room was nice and roomy. It is a pet friendly hotel which is nice. The pools were warm. The kids had a fun time in the huge wave pool. Definitely worth the stay!
30,Stayed at Mandalay Bay because the House of Blues is there and we had tickets to a concert at the venue. Staffing was virtual and non existent. Room on the 56th floor was very average. Walls are thin could hear our neighbor's conversations. No complimentary coffee in the room towels and sundries were sparse and of low quality. Everything cost extra. Everything!
50,Overall good experience one of the top hotels on the strip. It was my first time staying here I have stayed in many other hotels on the strip including many other MGM properties. Tram definitely helps with the location of this hotel since it is further from everything. But overall I liked the room and hotel itself took my in laws toddler & newborn with us as family friendly as Vegas gets haha. I would stay there again.
50,We recently stayed for the first time at the Mandalay resort. We will definitely stay there again. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. Our room was very nice. We absolutely loved the pool.
40,I like the design of the hotel and let’s face it the main draw are the pools. I received a wide range of service from excellent friendly and professional to rude and short. My room on the 18th floor is now showing it’s age and the rooms are now 23 years old. I would return. Might try Delano and see the difference. The drinks serviat the beach was non-existent. Ordered one at 10.10 am by Midday nothing arrived. Lovely smell in the lobby coconut and a tropical vibe.
50,I used my MGM rewards to stay a free night here and I loved it! Hotel feels pretty boujee. It’s very clean. My room was gorgeous. The hotel smells like coconut or Hawaiian tropic sunscreen. Wish it was closer to the action on the strip. Pool was awesome- lots of loungers available and friendly staff and servers.
10,I booked directly and ended up paying over $400 more than I should have for the same room. Then they used my rewards points at the hotel to do the price match. This is both false advertising and stealing in my book. Also there was hair in the shower from the previous guest. You clearly did not clean the shower.
20,The check was not at all quick or easy. The staff member was slow and very confused. I asked her to correct my name but she neglected to do so. There were buckets with hoses from the ceiling apparently there was a leak. This was right outside my room in the middle of the hallway...and was never fixed. The rooms need an update. The mini bar smelled extremely moldy. The safe is much too small. The woman who helped me in the market was extremely rude and dismissive. I would never stay here again or recommend this hotel
50,Great time the lazy River is by far the best in Vegas front desk was fast efficient and friendly. The Valet was also top notch along with always bugging security for directions they had no problem making sure we got wherever we were going. Safety was excellent at Mandalay Bay and the rooms are very quite and clean.
30,Wedding at this location and staff was helpful and great everything was timed and made everyone in the room cry so Definitely recommend to get married at this location  Very intimate for close friends and family
50,We were there for 3 days convention organizers was Choice. This place has exceeded our expectations and we were very pleased with cleanliness customer service and location . We will return to Mandalay Bay very soon for our next adventure.
50,The pools are awesome and cafes are nice...casino also pretty good. Hotel room is decent compare to lot of other casinos. Only one issue that i noticed couple of staffs at front desk bit strict. Apart from tht everything is good
30,cost to go is to expensive room cost probably high since it is close to the stadium although we were not going to the stadium. resort fee and tax no need parking expensive... i will find another place to stay next time..
50,Spent the weekend at this Resort. I was able to check in and get my digital key before I arrived so very seamless. Room was great and the staff were all very friendly and accommodating. I love staying here and taking the tram north if I need to head that way.
30,"Mandalay Bay is a great hotel but the fees they charge per day are extensive. Resort fees Valet parking fees ($30/day) food/water storage in the in-room frig $50/day and if you ""touch"" the honor bar you get charged. Coffee at the downstairs coffee bar is great but at $5.75/cup it should be!"
10,I asked for a fridge to be placed in my room for a medical need and every single time I stay here it is never in my room when I check in. I make sure that I note it when I make a reservation online. I don’t have this problem with MyRewards hotels.    I wanted to charge my car when I arrived but was unable to because of a weird hotel policy that wasn’t enforced before about your car must be valet to use the chargers. I tried explaining to by valet drivers that I did not want anyone in my car do to a medical condition. There needs to be more chargers installed for individuals that don’t want valet only options.    I was questioned about parking in a handicap parking spot. I guess disabled veteran plates are not honored at this hotel?
30,What a shame. I have stayed here for years ad this was less than desirable. The room was visibly dirty missing linens bags of trash and soiled linens left in hallway for over a day and a half. I had an issue with my door knob and although it was no ones fault it took them 45 minutes to come to my room. No apologies and I missed my meeting.
10,Played MyVEGAS to obtain a good rate for Friday. $119 rate and then room resort. Asked check in to make sure DO not disturb was in as just drove a straight 30 hours from WI with only a 3 hour nap and that I was extremely tired. Check in around 9:30 PM. Less than 4 hours of sleep at hotel when  1:15 AM was woken up by housekeeping with 4 nocks. Then a phone call. Had to get dressed then answered door. Called front desk and advised that housekeeping was at my door. Was offered a comp for breakfast but declined as I said sleep was more important to eating. I asked for a second night to be honored at the same price of 119. Was told all king beds were sold out at Delano. Was told hotel would comp the RESORT and PARKING FEES for Saturday night stay.    Saturday TV in main bedroom not working. The phones in my room were not working so walked to elevator to call. Advised that TV and Phone not working. Only TV was fixed after I came back to room.  Saturday night came back to the hotel after watching ONE Michael Jackson and two MOTHS were in room. Tried for 30 minutes to kill them then finally gave up. Again phones not working so used phones by elevator. There was little empathy from front desk on MOTHS and the inconvenience of having to get dresses again. Housekeeping came and were very apologetic (Thank you Timothy!!). I helped try to locate the MOTHS. Called front desk and asked for some type of compensation. Said she would talk to her manager for a better rate.    Overall the food was the pool.  Overall the bad/inconvenience 1) woken up 2) multiple trips to front desk 3) tv not working 4) phone in room not working 5) relaxing vacation without kiddos or husband turned into a stressful time.
50,Perfect place had a great time! Everything was clean and staff was friendly and accommodating. Definitely will be back! The hotel is very clean from the rooms throughout the casino. Pools are nice plenty of room.
40,Nice pool. Rooms are spacious. Located at southern part of the strip so quieter then places in middle of the strip. For the most part the staff is very friendly and helpful. (There’s always that one exception).
50,My stay at Mandalay Bay was amazing. The friendliness of the staff is exceptional. The lazy river is extremly relaxing. The beach pool is refreshing. The resturaunts and shops make the stay even better! Advice stop at Lush in the shoppes!
40,Mandalay Bay is a great family-friendly resort in the desert. Their attention on the variety of pools and lazy river experiences is very nice for those who want to have their families along. The rooms are nicely laid out but aren't well insulated (very noisy). We could hear everything going on in the room next to us. On one occasion that meant listening to a couple who was having a much better time than I was on that particular trip.
30,Room quality starting to show age even with upgraded room both parties thought rooms are in need of remodel. Low water pressure very little hot water beds and linens needing replaced and room smelled like smoke. This was even on the American express fine hotels list with upgrade at check in.
10,"This ""casino"" caters to kids. Pool scene is not ""Vegas"". It is like an oversold Cruise Ship. Too many (kids) people for the size of pool. Table games very limited - hard to get ""on a table"". Two bedroom suites are a ""RIP OFF"". Over priced for what they are"
50,Hotel and the staff were awesome. Everyone with a smile on their face. All staff very eager to answer all questions and point you in the right direction. Had dinner one night at Slice of Vegas great service very quick had the spaghetti and meatballs very good great garlic knots. Dinner at Lupo's tasty incredible and attentive staff food was very good ended with a nice drink called Get Up Get Up. Best meals and pizza at Bonnano's in the food court at the South Convention center always fantastic and worth the long walk to the far end of the complex.
50,Despite its age the Mandalay Bay is well maintained in all areas including the guest rooms. In its earlier years the staff - hotel and casino - used to have an attitude of arrogance that turned me off. That's why I have not stayed at Mandalay Bay for 22 years. NowI find them much more friendly and I am willing to consider a return stay. I usually visit Las Vegas 3 to 4 times a year solely for gaming purpose. Due to lower business level during/post Covid the casino is operating with limited tables except for peak hours. This I do find annoying as I prefer to play during the off-peak hours and find limited seat or table options.
50,Me and my Mrs had a wonderful time at Madalay Bay Resort &Casino we enjoyed the rest and enjoyed the difference restaurants we visit alone with the show with Michael Jackson review. The gambling room was also entertaini
50,It was my first time staying at the hotel but my business meetings are always at this hotel and I really enjoyed this stay I wish to come back next year. We had a little trouble finding the room and the signs were a little confusing but overall I had a great time with the services that was provided to us the staff members were really helpful as well so it was so beautiful beach. We enjoyed every bit of it.
30,We visited due to getting married and we were told by a staff member on the phone that we would be treated as such but this wasn't the case. We were ignored most of the time and our late checkout that we paid for was disorganized and not widely known across the staff. Housekeeping walked in thinking we were already checked out even though I confirmed after arrival that we had late check out as well. The pool is nice.
30,We paid for an early check in we didn't actually get inside the room until 5pm. Never received a text or email kept checking the MGM app for the digital key. Unfortunately the digital key for my iphone 8 was not working in the elevator. So back to the lobby to wait in line to get room keys. Nothing was done to correct this situation other than to remove the early check in fee. Your early check in is 1:00pm regular check in is 3:00pm so what is the deal with 5:00pm?
50,Easy to check in with the app didn't have to wait in line for check in or check out. The only thing is parking I had to pay parking on top of a resort fee but overall it was a great experience for my stay
10,Already addressed but inoperable phone made bell service valet concierge and room service impossible. No resolution to phone issues despite daily visit to desk to ask and get remedied. No help and no resolution.
10,Very bad experience. Room need lot of maintenance. Not worth of spending that much money. Have lot better option on strip. Will never stay again. Check inn was one thr wrost experience. Room was not clean.
40,You'll see a lot of lanyards and convention badges at Mandalay but the wave beach huge casino and large guestrooms also draw the college crowd.    Entertainment options are plentiful including Cirque de Soleil's Michael Jackson One.    The southern-most property on LV Blvd is connected by footbridge and tram to the Luxor and Excalibur and it's an easy cab ride to the mid-Strip.    The wide variety of dining options should satisfy anyone and the food is top notch. The Sunday brunch at House of Blues is justifiably famous even to locals. There is also a mall-style food court way in the back near the aquarium.    A solid choice for gaming and pool time but make the effort to get out and see more of what Vegas has to offer.
50,Frequent MGM property visitors typically stay at the Delano or MGM Grand tried the Mandalay for a 4 day stay for our 24th anniversary. Requested suite paid a bit more for an AMAZING room. My wife was a princess for the week and may even forgive me for some of the times I have drank from the milk carton and forgot to raise the toilet seat…  The service was exceptional non invasive and perfect. The facility clean maintained and safe. Pools are always amazing. Gaming was as it always is and that is okay as long as the service offsets the loss.    (as an aside we attended Micheal Buble (excellent) at Resorts world one evening following the concert and my wife’s Cell phone was stolen while at a slot machine. We dealt with security and discovered a few other people ripped off at the same time same way. In 19 years staying at MGM properties we have started to take security for granted. After spending $1400 to replace a phone I never will again)
40,Have stayed at the Mandalay Bay in the past and have always enjoyed the resort. The rooms are large and modern but sadly cleanliness has taken a hit and rooms are not spotless like they should be. The floor hasn't seen a vacuum cleaner in some time.
20,I lost an item of clothing from my room. Housekeeping had stopped by to clean the room the night before. That was the last time i saw my shirt. Everything else was ok but the theft was very disappointing.
40,Not withstanding the check-in issues our week's stay was pleasant. Housekeeper was very friendly and did a thorough job. Checkout clerk was outstanding. The dings for room and value are because for a vegas hotel charging 200 a night there were a couple small maintenance issues and the linens & duvet were identical to a Red Lion. Room service was too expensive - almost double the cost of the cafe.
50,First time in Vegas for a business trip- Staff was friendly welcoming and accommodating. I didn't have to venture far for anything I may had missed while packing as the quick stores and gift shops downstairs were very accessible.
50,Had a great view in a lovely room. The bathroom could’ve been cleaner as there were random hairs in the tub and sinks. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Location was great and had great dining choices.
40,Mandalay is always a good time. This stay was unusual in the fact that we had a couple issues…old food was in cupboard of our room gazebo we rented had some issues and the bartender at the pool was rude.
50,This is my Favorite Hotel on the Strip but the Casino is very tight so have to travel north to actually win any money. Too Bad I love the Hotel never needs updating. MGM has an o.k. rewards program but could be better. Comps are too hard to earn.
50,I’m a loyal person and always stayed at the Venetian. Until I seen the way guest services went above and beyond to show how appreciative they were of my business. When I needed help at the Venetian I felt like I was being interviewed. Way to go MGM  you gained a loyal one
50,Impeccable service by all staff including Convention staff. Clean modern rooms and clean adequate facilities throughout the resort. If I ever return to Vegas I'd choose Mandalay because I know I'll be wanted & cared for like I was family.
40,We had a two bedroom suite at the Mandalay Bay. It was a lovely suite that fit my family of five perfectly. Only complaint was that our room faced the pool and there was a concert at the pool from 9pm-12am We went out to dinner so got home around 10pm. It was pretty loud but we were still able to fall asleep. I guess depending on the performer it could be a positive or negative. Just something to be aware of.    I read lots of reviews that complained about service but we had a very positive experience. I had read about not opening the refrigerator because they charge you. So I requested an empty fridge for the room at the check in counter. It came up very quickly. I also saw housekeeping in the hallway and requested additional blankets/sheets for the room and they were in the room when I returned.    We were there for a Saturday night during spring break and the pool was very crowded so we decided to just walk through it. It was more of a water park than a relaxing pool.    It was a nice stay and would recommend it. Especially if you need a room that can accommadate a party of 5.
30,Mandalay Bay used to be my favorite. The last few times have been a disappointment. First none of the electrical outlets in the bathroom didn’t work. This time it was the phone. After reporting it several times nothing was done.
40,Good restaurants nice pools and large rooms. Very large casino with plenty of games available. Pool was not crowded so plenty of chairs available at any of the pools. Nice place to spend with the grand kids for the day when they were with us. People were friendly and made our stay enjoyable.
50,Went to Mandalay Bay for a conference. I loved the property and how clean everything was. The bed slept like a dream. The staff was friendly and helpful with questions. My favorite activity at the Mandalay Bay was the Ice Bar!
50,I enjoy staying at Mandalay Bay and love the water park on a warm summer day. The lazy River is fun and relaxing. There is a variety of restaurants and it is easy to get to the mall and other MGM casino/hotels.
50,We had a trip planned for my daughters graduation from University. We decided to stay at the Mandalay Bay because of the beautiful pool area. It did not diss appoint at all. The pool area was amazing! My direct deposit had not found into my account but the staff really worked with me by lowering my deposit of the room. Thank you Mandalay Bay and I will be going back.
50,Excellent will book another trip soon! Mandalay Bay was clean comfortable and inviting! Great atmosphere! The kids loved the pool. My daughter loves the salon. The shows were great. We will be back.
40,Mandalay Bay is great resort. The casino is clean and the least smokey of the other MGM properties we visited. The wave pool and lazy river is a must. Great for kids and adults. A cabana is a must! Service was great in all areas.
40,We would certainly stay at Mandalay Bay again. Everyone (except pool people) were extremely friendly and helpful. The property is beautiful and has a ton of amenities including a lazy river (which we couldn’t find and no one to help) and an aquarium (which was beautiful).  Room was spacious and bed was comfortable. Bathroom doors noisy when opening causing guests to wake up. Commode area really spacious but the shower area really small. Had to shut the sink drains at night because of the bubbling coming from the pipes anytime another guest ran water in their sink.  Pool area lacking tremendously. Way too many guests for size of pools and number of available chairs. People at the pool gate not helpful. Other guests said they had to go to the pool at 8:30 to get lounge chairs. Also young women selling cocktails need to be in better shape (not just thin) if their going to show that much skin. (Yes I said it.) I never saw so much cellulite from such young women-yuk-and most were really thin!)  Breakfast bar near lobby was fantastic and those workers really hustled!  Do more to eradicate the stale cigarette smell. (ALL the casinos need to do this.)
50,The premises were absolutely beautiful! 5 star all the way . Wish the pools stayed open later than 6 pm as the sun is out way longer . Would have been nice to have late check out . My son an I enjoyed the hotel
10,Very bad experience with the mobile check in at front desk.  The staff who’s doing check in was terribly racist and rude while I’m paying extra for guaranteed early check in she told me to stand in line and she checked in another person who did not have any early check in and get immediate room!  The worst! Hotel management needs to address this!
50,Loved the pool areas  loved the resort very luxurious and big ! Loved house of blues restaurant Bed was comfy!! Always a plus . Everyone was helpful got out on 58th floor vey happy ! I was incorrectly charged but it was handled very well
50,Mandalay Bay Resort is a fantastic hotel. Great entertainment fantastic casino. Wonderful restaurants. Rooms are clean modern and have excellent views. The wave pool and sandy beach with adjoining lazy river and other pools make this a great spot to play.
50,We stayed at Mandalay Bay for the ISPA Convention. It was perfect! We literally never needed to leave the hotel. The restaurants were delicious the gambling was lots of fun and the rooms were beautiful! Great value for a trade show hotel!
50,good  clean room friendly staff good food rooms good size bathroom good size amenities great lobby nice  front desk staff very accommodating  checking in was easy and checking out as well was quick
50,I came for the ISPA Show and had the most incredible time. Staff was kind and helpful. Property is gorgeous. LOVED the main stage and meeting rooms. Only negative experience was our evening by the pool event. We waited 45 minutes for drinks - that was sub-par
50,Mandalay Bay will always be out favorite hotel on the strip! Although it is on the far end I would still prefer staying there. Rooms are always clean! Pool is phenomenal! Staff are very friendly. Overall great experience
30,The casino is lovely and one of the classier in town but there were major brown stains on the sheets and the fresh air vents were very noisy when opened and closed. The seals must be dried out or cracked because they whistle constantly and keep us awake. Also don’t splurge on room service. I comes on paper plates in bags and coats a fortune.
50,I went to attend the Choice Annual Convention thousands of people visited/stayed in this hotel and everything looked well organized. The check-in was taking a little longer and Elizabeth working at the front desk noticed my frustration and kindly updated my room and offered an account balance of $50 to put on the room. The Suite I got was huge with a pretty mountain view. I feel the hospitality from everyone I encountered from the front desk to the housekeeper. The whole experience is 5 star!
50,The only issue that I have is the swimming pool closes way to early! The rooms were excellent and so was the room service. The restaurant’s were very good. The place was very clean and tidy. Checking in and out was very easy as well.
30,Rewards and comps don't get you much. A free room and $100 food credit. Other Casinos offer more in comps and free room. Very nice rooms clean comps very poor. Other casinos have more to offer for comps.
40,"Great property but not without fault. The ""beach"" is worth the stay.  Very good restaurants and pools. The Casino is a bit dull and the slots have become too expensive as in most of the strip.  The rooms are good but could use some renovation."
30,I dont mind paying 2-300 per night for a room. I love a good hotel room but having to pay for every little thing is taking it too far. No free coffee in the morning? and when we brought our own pods they tried to bill me for using theirs when we did not...(12 dollars per cup mind you) The 2-14 floors smell like smoke from the casinos...and we could hear the people next to us through the doors and walls
50,My overall experience was awesome great customer service from valet to housekeeping an bell person loved our two bedroom panoramic suite great views literally home away from him highly recommended love being a mgm member
20,I love Mandalay Bay; however they can really miss the mark in terms of hospitality.    I booked a king suite and the room was so deeply unsatisfactory that I was willing to downgrade to a regular room just to make anything better. The front desk staff informed me rudely that I was obligated to pay for a suite No matter what I did and that it was not their fault for my “sensitivities”. So I paid for a suite with a grand view of the rooftops when a basic king room would have been a better option. Thank you MB team! Much appreciated.
50,It was very nice and people were great. Would be nice more food and entertainment. Food are to expensive but over all was great experience price wise hotel stay could use a cheaper since everyone is hurting with money. It shouldn’t be just gambling buy family vacation too
20,I booked a king room for our anniversary we specifically. We get there and they put us in a double bed! Being a 300+ man in a double bed with my plus size wife was very uncomfortable. Then we where charged $40 per day that was not disclosed to us until we arrived. The pillows in the room had black smears all over it. I can understand that is an accident but it just added to my frustration. There was no airport shuttle. I never been at a hotel without a shuttle. This was my first time in Vegas. The app for the hotel is not user friendly either. Tried to book a couples spa massage and it will not advance to next screen. The beach was not that big of a deal. It was a large pool.
50,Great pool and lovely rooms. Club pool scene for those that want it and chill pool for those just looking to relax. Excellent service at the cabanas. Clean rooms and great dining choices. Parking was a little tricky to find but once you know then it is easy in/out.
50,The staff property and restaurants were all fantastic! This is a well run property! All of staff that we encountered throughout the trip starting at the front desk and extending to wait staff dealers and housekeeping were all fantastic! Don’t let the end of strip location deter you this place is great and easy to get around from.
20,We arrived early and performed an early check-in with staff. According to the staff we will received a text when room ready. That never happened so we decided to go to the front desk after 3pm room still no available. Furthermore request room upgrade and staff didnt even bother to respond to our request. Staff look like always trying to avoid clientele/customers from what we saw also our own experience
10,I booked a room at Mandaly Bay Resort & Casino and they sent me to a different hotel (same group) nex tto they hotel. It was absolutely not what I ordred. It is unacceptable. They refused to refund me my money. Don't book with them. the room was dirty.
50,We came for a birthday and had a great time. Front desk staff was amazing and helpful. Table dealers were friendly. The tram from Mandalay Bay to excalibur saved us some walking. Ate some delicious meals at the hotel’s restaurant. Will definitely be back.
50,Loved the hotel stayed there for a wedding. My first time visiting Vegas. I do plan on staying there again in the near future. It was accessible to alot of things in the strip. The staff also was very friendly
50,Took my girlfriend for her first trip to Vegas. Had a great time at the Mandalay Bay. Rooms are clean and the customer service was excellent. Actually won some money gambling. Definitely will return. The pool is one of the best in Vegas.
50,Great hotel - seems like it was recently redone; all furnishings were like new. Service was greatas well. Everything you want is located right there - I didn 't leave the hotel. The pool setup is beautiful and well done. This is one of the top hotels on the Strip.
50,Enjoyed the hotel. Very clean with very friendly employees. Dining options were great as well. The free monorail was very helpful to easily visit surrounding hotels/casino and helpful avoiding the busy streets.
50,Everything from our check in to checking out was exceptional. Everyone was friendly and very accommodating. We can wait to stay here again. With the Tram and walkways between casinos it was very convenient to get to were ever you wanted.
50,Love this casino. Staff courteous helpful and friendly. The patrons are upbeat and friendly as well. The only thing I would suggest is for the sake of safety a grab bar be installed in the showers.
50,Mandalay Bay was a wonderful place to stay. The room was very nice and spacious. The staff at Mandalay Bay were friendly and very helpful. The restaurants and casino were very nice also. I would definitely stay here again!
50,exellent place to stay very clean and the service is great the empoyees are very nice and very helpful we h  d fun and we are very happy  the atmosphere is great we highly recommended Mandalay Bay Resort . thank you to Ron Ellwood .
50,I came with my sons and we met my sister and neice who live in California. We had a marvelous time. Everything about our trip was wonderful.  The Beautiful hotel restaurants casino and our room was fabulous. Staff was wonderful.  Thank you for everything
40,Everything was great as usual but the slot machines were tight as a drum. I lost $4000 in 5 days and I was playing conservative. I didn't use most of the amenities but I'm sure they are fine. I would stay here here and gamble elsewhere.
30,Room cleaning was not great had to ask for items when they ran out music at pool way too loud going there to relax same for breakfast restaurant blaring music great food though. Need better system for valet waits too long.
50,We were taken care of very nice. The room was ample and the goodies were great. If we come back to LV we will stay at Mandalay Bay again. The Casino was clean and just about perfect. Of course it could have paid better but thats normal.
40,Great experience at Mandalay Bay! Beautiful hotel with lots of energy and amenities. Casino was fun and had a great staff. The pool and beach area was great but the weather unexpectedly got much colder so we didn't enjoy it. Looking forward to returning!!
50,The propertyroom and staff were great!I dined at Stripsteakdelicious! My only complaint was overnight dining. The only thing available was subwayvery disappointing.I would think a resort of that quality would have a better option.
50,Friendly Staff  Our get well room was very clean and spacious. Great view of the Vegas Skyline.  Great Restaurants to choose from food was excellent everything from food courts to fine dining.  The pools were fantastic
50,We love Mandalay Bay!! The casino is nice and spacious and the pool area is second to none in Vegas!!! The staff was very friendly. On our day to check out the front desk was very accommodating and allowed us to stay in our rooms a bit longer to make it easier for transferring to the airport for our flights.
40,I loved the Resort and the room but… Bathroom needs a deep cleaning. I’m sorry I used to be a housekeeper and I take a look to everything and the shower had hair from previous people since we didn’t even washed our hair. And also it had mildew on a couple places and also the sinks had a little mildew. But overall I will definitely stay there again.
10,Hotel was not nice at all waited 1 hour for room service several times No blankets on beds just flat sheets Towels for bathroom were old In casino nobody asked if we wanted something to drink didn't even see anyone to ask Will never stay again !!!!!!
30,Rooms tired - 1 Star + Staff Service 5 Stars = Avg 3 Star Review  Here for conference and vacation - 4 days    Tips/Info I wish I knew or discovered:  (This is as of our stay April 2022)    Uber / Luggage - The drop off is at Main Registration and Convention Center with luggage check in. Main desk gets locked in a room conference was out in open but hotel staff physically present / guarding with it.  Uber is hotel preference. Use Uber. It has its own pick up and drop offs. Very organized.  Ubers were about $12-15 daytime and $20 at night for our needs.    Pool - They let me bring in my own (non-glass) cup with lid and straw. Free Ice from bar with self-serve water station to left of bar(s). They did allow people to bring in their own circular floaties. Round tubes for lazy river. Some folks had small/moderate seated floaty chairs. OR buy their circular floaty $30. No other floaty styles to buy. They handed out marker to write name on it.    Room coffee - They include coffee K Cups for their machine in the mini bar. I brought KCups creamer small plastic cup (to fit under small machine) my tea pot and Via and our own coffee cups. We also bring small food items to get us by/out the door easy in AM.    Frig - Off limits. Filled with mini bar supplies. Don’t touch. Use ice bucket or collapsible or hard side cooler if needed. People checked full size coolers filled with ice in ice room (on each hallway.) Nobody cared.    Misc:  Beds comfy  ALL hotel staff - excellent service.  Rooms are worn but it takes time to rehab don’t notice details. It was clean lots of storage sufficient hangers iron decent products for bathing.    Restaurants on property - All Excellent Service. Pricing and menus available in MGM App under Dining and/or Yelp. There is a Food Court Restaurants in the Shopping hallway/wing that are cheaper if feeding kiddos. We typically only eat out dinner and do it on property. (Unless our excursion is Vanderpump’s or similar.). Early dinner then night out.    Shows - Cirque du soleil is typically 1/3 the price in Vegas as other towns. Go to one of their shows each trip. It’s a can’t miss. No bad seats. Buy in advance or at ticket office on site. All other shows same thing. Take one in.    Shopping - The Caesars Forum Shops and The Shops at Crystals are not to miss.
10,They did so much wrong I don't know where to start first the concierge emailed for arrival on wrong date then bill that wasn't right that showed up on app ..then they kicked my 28 year old stepson out of the casino cause they didn't know what a regular pa license looked like ..then they apologized and gave cards for food to say sorry about what happened. And then when I went to use them the restaurant refused to accept them so now their making me look stupid.. worst experience in a Las Vegas hotel ever ..I am ready to go to Caesars from now on I don't know if I'll ever go back to mgm they treated me like crap and I'm platinum tier there
50,We came to Vegas for a quick family trip. I have never stayed at Mandalay Bay Resort before so we tried it out. I was very impressed with dining options and quality. The room was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable! We had a bath tub in our room so we were able to soak our feet after a long day of walking the strip. I was over all VERY impressed with this Resort. The Beach was amazing and had something for everyone. All ages had options to go do something. Tram next door was convenient. Walk way to Raiders football stadium. We went to the Michael Jackson show at the Resort and it was AWESOME! We even got a free upgrade. Over all clean and beautiful Resort. Quality and convenient. We will be back!
20,Spent extra for a 2200 suite. Definitely not worth it! Got a big empty room with a large conference table and tech prks didn't work-tv in bedroom bluetooth mirror steam shower-all didn't work. Very disappointed..not coming back.
40,I'm not a fan of Vegas and Mandalay Bay changed my mind. Everyone was very courteous and the stay was great; room was wonderful and I loved the separate bathtub. One thing that is not great is NO prices on any items in the convenience stores. The prices are high---I understand that---but I don't want to ask about every single item vs. blindly paying.
50,Great hotel and casino. Airport is loud and can hear it all night in the room. MGM could step up in the rewards but overall a great place. I enjoyed the topless pool lots of great sightseeing available!
20,Booked a panoramic 2 bedroom suite and was expecting an exceptional room. Very disappointed that TV in one of the rooms was not working speakers not working phones not working. Took forever for engineering to come up but ended up not able to fix anything. Stated will have tech come up to the room but that took forever as well we ended up just going to bed. Had to call Bellagio to get through and get transferred to Mandalay’s front desk since no one answers when you call the main line. It was supposed to be a fun retreat but ended up disappointed. When i told the front desk the am of check out sounded not nice and said “oh we took off resort fee” and that’s their resolution. Wow! Oh well 2 stars for the view of the room.
50,have been there more than once and it was always comfortable and clean good room service overall beautiful hotel. Would definitely go again. Lots of places in hotel to eat beautiful waterfalls and different sights to see along with Shark reef of which was simply amazing
40,The people from front desk was great! But in casino no! Specially in MGM rewards and cashiers they only have 2 cashiers. Hopefully when I came back they hire more staff.but still great experienced!! I’m still gonna go back
50,I am 31 been coming to vegas since childhood and always wanted to stay here. Yes the hotel is starting to get bit old but i loved it. basic rooms no complaints. I Loved the beach and multiple pools!-totally helps with crowds! yes its at far end of strip but i prefer the chill vibe and had a car to get around. And the layout and casino floor etc was so easy and simple. Oh and my first time winning a big amt on slots :) I really loved this hotel and will be back very soon.
10,Used to be good ; goos no more. Only good thing was the comfortable bed . Pool was crowded and not nice staff...mlife promotions sucked  dinner wasn't very tasty overpriced. I am very disappointed in how many hidden fees there are
50,Staff was friendly and extremely helpful when assistance was needed. The room was extremely clean from the moment you entered and house keeping stayed on top of everything during the stay. Couldn’t even tell a casino or party was going on.
30,Our in room AC didn’t get very cold so the room was warm at night (couldn’t sleep). Phone in the room was broken. No fridge to store any food/drinks. Very loud bathroom door. The pools and sand are nice for kids. But bring your own float for the lazy river they don’t just have them like I assumed. You have to buy one for $30.
50,The Mandalay Bay never disappoints. I love the way it smells the atmosphere is pleasant the rooms are spacious the food is wonderful and the Beach pool is great! I always stay at the Mandalay Bay when I visit Las Vegas. Great times and memories!!
50,Enjoyed my stay!! The wave pool and lazy river were amazing. The room on the 58th floor had and awesome view of the strip. The bed was very very comfortable! Dining was great with lots of options in the hotel and close by. Will definitely stay here everything I travel to vegas
50,My wife and I stayed in a Strip-view King. The room was large and clean. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was bright clean and had great water pressure. We enjoyed the pool area drinks in the Foundation Room and dinners at various restaurants. Mandalay Bay is a great resort for a long weekend with your significant other.
50,We enjoyed this place. all staff treated us well and surprised the other guest were all well behaved. I heard during covid there were so many poor people around vegas as rooms were so cheap that it was not a good place to be. Lot of scary people smoking all over. It has recovered and it great now!!
40,I’ve stayed at many strip hotels alone and this is one of my favorites to stay at. I always feel safe easy to navigate and great amenities  and great food and drinks. The spa is an experience and staff are friendly and professional
10,Terrible service booked room to check in early had to wait. Set up another room did not work. The new suite was nice however with kids there was a club under us so we just heard loud music until 3-4 am.
40,Everything with our stay was great  Rooms really should have coffee there is a coffee machine and we had to wait a couple hours to check in even though our check in time was 3 our room was available at 5. We had to change and rush the show
50,Staff was great for our 20th Anniversary celebration. great view from our room of The Strip. Excellent service. Michael Jackson One was awesome and dining experiences were great. Everything was perfect.
50,Mandalay Bay is a very well kept resort. Staffers were seasoned professionals who take their jobs seriously. They were accommodating and knowledgeable at all times. The common areas rooms and elevators were always clean. The key pods consistently worked. Although it was Spring Break there was absolutely no loud noise or parties on my floor.    This was such an amazing experience I will definitely return to Mandalay Bay next time I visit Las Vegas!!! In the past I stayed at the Hilton.
50,Mandalay Bay was super excellent will let friends know and and employers I work with the beach pool was super excellent and restaurant is super excellent the room I stayed in was super clean and super excellent
30,Shop worn rooms check in app worked great Towels are too thin. Beds are really good Food in coffee shop was good for breakfast Had a great server! Crap tables were all $25 minimum very cold all weekend
10,Our Sink was clogged upon arrival and filled with dirty water. The carpets looked like they had t been cleaned either with stains on them. Pretty sure we checked into a room which was only partially cleaned. Also we asked the hostess in front of Foundation Room how to get to the lower level valet and she was extremely rude and acted like we bugged her because she had to break away from her phone for 5 seconds. The front desk agent was also emotionless upon arrival. We didn’t feel welcome and have been staying with Mandalay for years and now we won’t ever be coming back there. We were celebrating our 5 Year Anniversary and I don’t know why they asked if they didn’t even mention it or treat us like anything more than another number when we got there.
20,We found a hand full of hair in our bath tub. Cleanliness was not up to our standards. Room doors do NOT keep much of the hall way sounds out of the rooms this made our baby keep wailing up at night. No space in mini fridge at all. We were not able to enjoy our room because of these. Pool area was enjoyable.
30,The hotel costs about $300.00 per night for an average room. For that you get a clean room with average sheets and pillow cases. The sheets at Comfort Inn are more comfortable. There’s no free coffee in the room. If you use it it’ll cost you $4.00 a cup. The hotel is nice clean but they nickel and dime you to death. The costs of all food or drinks are high and the pools are nice looking but not what you expect from reading the description of the hotel. The wave pool generates one small wave every 90 seconds and if you want to use a raft on the lazy river you have to buy it for $30.00 each. They are your average donut raft you can buy anywhere for $6.00 except for the fact they’re purple and have the resort name on it. I think it’s an overpriced hotel for what you get.
40,We booked at the Mandalay for the last night of our golf trip returning to Las Vegas the night before our flight home. I had never stayed there before. The hotel was clean the staff were great and the rooms were bright modern and clean. The bathrooms were large with a soaker tub and an oversize walk in shower.  The restaurants were very good and they had a really good live band playing in the casino in the evening.  The pools were amazing! I will definitely stay here again when we have more time to explore and relax.
20,They overbooked rooms and were rude even though it was their mistake. Instead of trying to upgrade us to rectify their mistake they were trying to give us 2 queens or an accessible shower which would have been cheaper for me during the original reservation but I specifically paid more to reserve a king room . Receptionist didn’t care and was extremely rude. Bathroom kept making weird noises all night and they never cleaned our room.
50,Loved the Mandalay Bay. Great place to stay. Fast check in. Beautiful rooms. The restaurant at the House of Blues was great! Will stay here again! Easy access to other hotels via tram. Pool is beautiful
20,The check in person provided no information. Conflicting information was received in regards to room cleaning. Most days I had to make more than one call to in order to get fresh towels and some days the room was never cleaned even though it was requested. The last night of my stay the hallway was lined with bags of trash and dirty linens and unopened beer bottles.
50,"Enjoyed the food and the casino. MB has it all. Second time here and we'll back again soon. The staff was always accessible and willing to help with any type of question or concern. They made for an enjoyable and comfortable stay. (The slots could have been a bit ""friendlier"" lol)"
30,I wanted to spend a good time with the family at Mandalay Bay but to be our 1st time at this hotel we are not impressed. We had stood at Green Valley Ranch Casino for a cheap price of 200 dollars and the suite was much bigger and better with complementary water and coffee and a great view of the pool and city. Here I have to bring my own water and own coffee because each water here at the room is 20 dollars per bottle and 12 per coffee. Do not open the fridge because it will automatically charge you 50 dollars. not happy for a 700 dollar room.
40,I was here for a birthday dinner with 30 other friends that was great. I found the rooms to be average but there were soooooo many options to eat; to be entertained; to gamble; to hang out; and to even enjoy the outside.
50,I had a great stay at your hotel. The staff was friendly and room service was fast. My daughter loves the pool there were so many of them. The food at the sea breeze was great as well. The hotel was clean and I felt right at home.
50,The entire atmosphere of the resort is what we have come accustomed to. This was our 3rd visit to Mandalay Bay. It is a perfect mix of laid back classy but not stuck up atmosphere. Good entertainment at Rhythm and Riffs. If your an 80's kid see Swipe Right Band if they are playing.
30,The hotel apparently allows dogs. And once one starts barking non-stop the other just join in. I got no sleep one night because of so many dogs barking - it was truly like sleeping in a kennel. Otherwise a nice hotel with an outstanding staff!
30,I don't smoke but there is smoke in the casino which you have to walk thru to get to conference or restaurants. So there was that and then you can't use the fridge in the room because it's part of the MB's ploy to get more money from you by charging you for any of the items in the fridge or on the counter. Everything co$t$ money. We were there for conference so we already had that expense flight food etc. The rooms are nice; bed comfy. Because of security you can't go to the top of the hotel to take pictures of the landscape at night unless you happen to be staying up there. We were on the 3rd floor and had a nice view of the roof of a building with all it's vents and industrial things that are on roofs. It seems like our room should have been deeply discounted for that reason alone. All the rooms are a long walk to the conference center. Like 15 minutes. Wear comfy shoes! I didn't eat breakfast at any of the restaurants because I brought a loaf of banana bread with me so that was a savings but lunch would be more than $20 for one person and my friends spent over $100 for dinner for just the 2 of them. This is not a place to stay if you're not the kind of person who doesn't like to blow money.
40,The hotel was very nice and clean. The pool was great and the staff was beyond friendly. My only issue is that it's basically in the boonies. It was a pain in the ass to get anywhere because you have to take a cab or Uber instead of just walking.
20,We reserved 2 rooms a day apart. One for us and one for our daughter who was arriving after us. Our flight had got in late so we didn't get to check in until 130am. While checking-in for our room we asked if our 2nd room could be on the floor as us. The front desk clerk sent our request to his manager and it got approved. He advised us that his manager had put a hold on the 2nd room that was right next to us and to come back at 9am for the keys. We had gone back for the keys at 10am and was told by the new front desk clerk that there were no keys waiting for us. I asked if she sees anything in her system for our request and she didn't. What a disappoint from the previous clerk and manager of all people for lying to us. Moving forward the new clerk was extremely helpful and found a room a door away from ours but said that we'd have to come back for the keys once again. I didn't believe her and was ready to just cancel both of our reservations and find somewhere else to go. But she had re-assured me that the room was reserved for us and had the system text us that the room was on hold and will text again when the keys are ready. We decided to take the Tram and explore Luxor and Excalibur while waiting and got a text 2hrs later for the keys. The rooms are in need of a deep cleaning. The beds were comfortable but the hard water build-up on the faucets are extremely gross. It looked like green and white gunk that's been sitting there for awhile. Yuck!  If you're brown skinned or of asian decent like myself don't bother eating at Stripsteak they'll seat you at the back of the restaurant in a semi-private room and forget that you're there. I didn't take notice until my very asian-looking daughter had observed that the room we were eating in only consisted of dark/brown/asian colored skin. There were many tables available in the main part of the restaurant but they were cramming us all in one room. Service was extremely slow. Tables that came in after us that were sitting on the main side were getting their food before us and leaving before us. If you're looking for breakfast check out House of Blues. They're very welcoming and food is point. Rhythm & Riffs is a 24-hr bar. So if you get in late like us and in need of a drink check them out. Grab a table away from the bar and just people watch. Trust me you'll be entertained while sipping on your cocktail. Libertine Social is also good for a quick drink and appetizer. They're ceviche was delicious.
40,Mobile checkin was a huge time saver. Rooms are nice. Restaurants and food outlets are very pricy. I purchased the room rate that includes a $50/night food credit. That helped with the dining costs - paid for 1 lunch for 2 at the Seabreeze cafe
20,Loud concert ruined calm oasis. Just didn’t have the The quiet get away we were lookin for. Also wouldn’t let us have late checkout on a Monday. Some staff were rude some were very sweet. Just not the usual from MB
30,The pool is a draw for families with kids. It is not smoke free BUT it was free of rowdy drunken guests working girls and the smell of pot. Food expensive and sub par. Room very clean and comfortable
50,Several staff members seemed to go out of their way for no apparent reason. Property looks beautiful. Great choice of restaurants and the pool can't be beat. When was the last time you were in a lazy river? Exactly!
50,Everything was great but the room sink drain. It drained show. The food was good customer service was good and the towels smelled good. The room smelled good too. The view of the pool was great! Everything is a bit pricy there tho. An if you smoke bring them with you.
20,The hotel is dingy and old. The room was not well cleaned with hair found on towels and in bathtub. Poor acoustics between rooms - could hear guests and tv through my entire stay.  Digital key cards wouldn’t work. Multiple trips required to fix cards. Checkin staff not polite.
10,They charge: Umbrella and chair (you can’t get the umbrella without the chair)- 200$. If you use their refrigerator in YOUR room- 50$ Floater for the lazy river:30$!! And the room was 500/night! Save yourself a ton of money and go to Harrah’s or The Flamingo.
50,Extremely impressed with the MLB. We were treated like valued guests from the moment we entered the resort. Our room was a King on the 27th floor with a strip view. Good sized room with a comfortable bed and a well appointed bathroom. All the employees were friendly and helpful. Every restaurant we tried had great food and of course Las Vegas prices. Most of our days were spent at one of the resorts wonderful pools. They were never crowded and we had no problem finding chairs. Be sure to try a Miami Vice drink from the pool bar. Also take a moment to walk outside to the front of hotel and see the Valley of the Falls! The casino was very nice and I also won some money. Slots are very tight. Just keep in mind this resort is on the far end of the strip and is a long trip to the center of the strip. I will definitely visit this resort again.
40,Exploring Vegas for the first time I noticed the mandalay was the cleaner than all the other locations on the strip was very satisfied with the staff and the swimming pool other than the long line of people which is common everywhere I think this is a great place to spend your whole stay vacation/business
50,Went here for our 19th anniversary. Absolutely loved the property. Very clean along with friendly staff. Beautiful property with plenty of options for dining entertainment and shopping. Highly recommend and will definitely stay here again.
50,Celebrating my daughter’s 21st birthday with my mom son sister nieces and nephews. We always stay at the Mandalay and enjoy the resort. Just wish you all didn’t close so early. Overall we had a great time!
20,Another major corporation nickel and dimes your stay in Vegas. We have to stop rewarding these companies for high costs (Parking? LAME) for mediocre service. You'll stay here a maximum of one time. I loved that the in-room service fridge and counter is very sensitive! Touch the fridge and you'll be charged fifty bucks just for looking! SERIOUSLY???
50,Great value for the price. We had a great stay at Mandalay Bay. Property as well cats staff is polite large pool area that is large enough to accommodate all hotel guests. It’s convenient to take the shuttle from the hotel to Luxor or ex caliber. Many activities and restaurants to choose from.
50,First time staying at Mandalay Bay and it was a great experience. Citizen Kitchen and bar gave excellent service as well. I’ll definitely stay at this hotel in the future. Valet and room service gave excellent customer service as well.
20,Do NOT recommend. Will NOT stay here again.    I booked my room through Hopper one month before a couples’ birthday trip to Vegas. Upon arrival I was told that they were completely booked and they needed to move things around to find us a room. We were given a $100 voucher to use in the hotel as compensation for the wait. Once in our room (about 2 AM at this point) we discovered FRESH blood-stained sheets used glassware and missing toiletries. I called guest services and they told me they would comp my resort fees. Since the hotel was fully booked we were unable to switch rooms. When we checked out my bill was $163 (the correct amount). However two days later I was charged $363 without notice. I emailed three different accounts called their customer service number (which was closed both times I called) and disputed the charge on my account. After hearing nothing back for a week I called the hotel directly and they looked up my bill. They confirmed the credits were supposed to be on there but somehow weren’t and I was now being charged $263. They did not apologize for the incorrect charge on my account nor did they apologize for the abhorrent conditions our room was in. I am still waiting for the $100 refund three days later.
20,Our room was left unmade. On 2nd night at 9 pm we tried to call front desk but phone system was not working. Went to desk and received apology and 75.00 credit. Next two nights….no room cleaning again. I don’t want 75.00 I want a clean room. That’s 2 drinks at the pool. Clean the room please.
20,No garbage can wash clothes or glasses in room. No bible in the drawer. Hear plumbing from other rooms 24/7. Low water pressure in shower. Lots of kids in the hot tub. Far end of the strip. Spend more and stay at a nicer hotel in the middle of the strip.
40,Used more of the amenities at the hotel and was very impressed. my only complaint would be the air quality in the casino. Would be more fun if the smoke could be filtered off. Too many ashtray laying around with ashes. Empty beer and drink glasses around slots.
50,Great place to go for adults and young children. So many things to do at the resort especially the pool. Also lots of close sister hotels you can travel to fast using the free tram. Makes it easy for the kids and adults.
50,The resort was very well maintained. The guest rooms were large and the bed was comfortable. I enjoyed the Shark Reef and the other on site amenities. The Tram was a great source of transportation to cut down on some of the walking.
50,Terrific experience. Mandalay Bay had it all. Quality service comfortable rooms terrific atmosphere. Loved the food and service from Boarders. No wait time. Beautiful open floor plan not crowded. Highly recommended.
20,The rooms are nice and the location is great however the essentials charge at $100 a day we will ruin your trip if you are not prepared. I stayed five days on a comped trip and no one mentioned the essentials fee. So when I checked in I was charged over $500 and it was taken out of my bank account leaving me no money for food or gambling. I only had my free play resort credit and fortunately my twin sister was there with me.
50,While it was a bit further away from the main strip I don’t have anything bad to say about my room  Check in was so smooth. Casinos were clean and maybe not a Smokey as some of the others I went too. Main drawback to casinos for me
50,Hotel was excellent friendly staff great location. Rooms were clean and up to date. The beds are soft and comfortable the pillows are soft and comfortable. The check in and out very simple and the digital room key is amazing
40,We stayed here with kids for the pool/beach. The area is amazing! Great wave pool and lazy river. Bring your own tubes to save $. Only issue is they only allow 1 outside beverage/person and wasnt allowed to bring ice. They want you buying food/drinks from resort. Rooms were very large and clean!! Tram to Luxor and Excalibur is great then close walk to NY NY. Food court is a tad far away IMO. We ate at Luxor or Excalibur more often. Casino floor is open and spacious. Service was ok. Nothing special but I feel it's prob on par with most casino floors. Overall good time and would stay here again.
50,Outstanding service friendliness and value. Great location. I would 100% stay here again. From staff to management very customer oriented. We all enjoyed our stay. I would recommend this resort to anyone whether a family trip business or couples trip. Lots to enjoy at Mandalay Bay.
30,Our room was very dark...we were put in a hearing impaired room... Our bathroom light didn't work we had to have maintenance fix... the lights next to the bed had a short or something...and the other lamps outlet for charging didn't work oh and the police were called on our neighbors who were verbally and physically assaulting eachother all day and night... it wasn't our best stay with Mandalay bay unfortunately we were there for 6 days
50,Everything was great except the valet fees and resort fees. Need the old Vegas back to where they took care of your guest. Room was awesome. Moorea was amazing. Great place for couples to go and unwind.
50,We usually stay at the MGM but the prices at Mandalay Bay were fair. The experience was great. The hotel is far more compact than MGM but has ample if not more amenities. The rooms also are nicer and the hotel cleaner. The night scene is much better as well. Good band at Rythm & Rifts. Food was good and the pool area was great. Would have given 10 but the pool is full of kids. Would be nice to have an area for adults.
50,Great stay rooms were nice and big. Housekeeping cleaned the rooms everyday. Bellhop was very friendly and helped keep our bags safe until we left for the airport. A lot of great dining options at the resort.
50,Nice resort to relax at. A little noisy at the pool but not as bad as some of the other resorts. Recommend a high room and extra pillows. Contactless checkin through the phone was nice but I didn't have internet access at the door so couldn't use it. Had to go to the lobby and wait in line.
50,Check in was really easy and fast. The room was clean and we had a great view! The only problem would probably be the location its a little far from the strip but nothing an uber can’t fix! Overall this was a great resort! We were really happy with our stay.
50,The property was awesome! You ready don't need to leave the hotel for anything they so much right in the hotel to do and see. From multiple food court to 3 daiquiri shop 2 up stairs one down. I had a great time.
40,Mandalay bay is awesome place to stay the room we stayed in was beautiful and had a big tub and a shower it's kn the strip so plenty of things around Def worth while  The pool is awesome as well  The check in staff could have been mote helpful with wiifii and suggestions of what to do or restaurants but other than that it was a great stay
10,We came here for a conference and what a mess it was from start to finish  When we came in to use the valet we almost got hit by multiple passing cars as it is very far away from the entrance of the building check-in was confusing with the multiple lines that lead to nowhere the clerk attendant gave us sass about our emotional support dog even though we were willing to pay and did pay the $100 pet fee  There was no directions except the QR code which was in 3D map and no 2D map to compare it to  The whole hotel smells like a tobacco factory with old rooms which a good bathtub but nothing else  They are a pet tolerant hotel (definitely not pet friendly) as there was only one area that was shown to us as a place for her to be in made the room almost to the very far end of the hallway and not close to the elevator for easy access to the one pet area or even to the convention center  The convention center was also very old and the staff didn’t even know our conference was going on  Most of the staff was friendly with the one exception being the clerk but as we were checking out it took the bell hop 70 minutes to get our bags  I would avoid this hotel at all costs and I will not be going back ever in the future
40,Nice hotel clean rooms. Service and knowledge ability of staff was lacking. My wife is asthmatic and the walk through the smoky casino to the monorail was not pleasant. In addition the Xpress line was not running. The food at Della was good. Great location to go to the Knights game!
20,Avg. room. Poor service. Very high prices for every possible item. Low value. Ashes or dirt in sink that backed up while we were out. No response after reporting. 50 bucks service fee.and 15 dollars for room coffee from the tray. 13 dollar small soda. 20 dollars boiled burger at the pool. Wage pool a disappointment for the kinds.  Not.a.good value at all.
50,It was an amazing stay and the resort pool experience was awesome. Location was great even though it was at the end of the strip. I was here on business but will come back with the kids and spouse. The property is amazing!
50,My husband and I just got back from a fantastic trip in Las Vegas! The hotel was OK if you’re seeing a concert on the beach I would suggest not drinking too much there are only eight women’s stalls so be prepared to wait in long lines.  The highlight of our trip was a bartender named Ryan. We saw him at a bar named Hazel’s and then a few days later at the center bar in the Mandalay Bay. He remembered our names our drinks and genuinely seemed interested on what we were doing and suggested a great venue for dinner! With Vegas being shut down for eight months in 2020 you can tell the service industry is very excited to have people back. Also if you’re not staying at the Mandalay Bay but you’re popping in for a drink prior to a show or a concert I would suggest tracking down Ryan; he will make your day or night!
30,Aftera long day of softball tournament we decided to stay here to relax and be rested to come home the next day.. Getting there was very exciting beautiful hotel. Very helpful employee’s was able to get my room very quickly. Rooms were very clean restrooms was very beautiful just the toilet was leaking from the bottom  Part other than that was good. No complains.. wondering why i gave 1 star well after a long day we were very tired my family and i got woken up by screaming moaning and everything you can think of my kids woke up very scared it went on for hours we didnt get any sleep literally you could hear everything
30,"We had a great stay at Mandalay Bay but we were very disappointed with the ""water park"" no chairs no shade people eating on the floor not enough staff to order drinks. We left after looking for place to sit for an hour same thing next day. I'm sorry but I am not waiting in line 1 hour before the park opens to get a spot also the pools close at 6 so forget about night swim. Make sure to bring your own tube they sell them for $30 at the park."
20,Room large. Staff friendly. Food poor to average; Pricey: Breakfast burrito and coffee $49! BUT casino was abysmal. In 3 days WORST payout I’ve seen in 45 years in Vegas. Gambling?you win you lose. This was non-stop losing in various games. It wasn’t the amount lost; it was the stunning lack of ANY-winning plus shockingly low payouts. I play for fun not to win a jackpot. But this was neither. Don’t mind losing; this was a crime. NEVER going back.
30,I’m very disappointed with the room experience both television and phone not working and we spend another 30 minutes in line to check out where we could have done it inside the room and the room itself is not fully clean see above comments.
20,Rooms were not clean when we did mobile check in. Elevators hardly worked . Not a great experience. Mobile check in had issues when checking out and room card on app hardly worked. Definitely disappointed
40,The hotel was built back in late 90's so it definitely shows its age in some spots here and there but overall they still keep it in pretty good shape and I am sure part of the establishment has been renovated throughout the years. We were check into a strip view double queens room on a high floor and it is spacious. It looks and feels clean as well. We have requested a separate frig since the one that come with the room are all stocked up with drinks. I was told once any drinks are removed from the frig for more than a few second it will get charged to your room assuming you have consumed it (same for the mini bar with snacks and water at the table top so better off leave them alone). Having a separate frig for your own definitely comes in handy. One gripe that we have is the room really lacks in some basic amenity. It provides you a k-cup coffee machine but no coffee nor tea is provided not even some paper cups in case you buy your own k-cups or tea bags for your own consumption in the room.  One of the selling points of this hotel is the swimming facility. This is the only Vegas hotel that offers a wave pool and lazy river which are great for family. However the wave pool leaves a lot to be desired. First the waves are so weak and second you have to wait more than two minutes in between waves instead of the waves coming in succession. This seems to defeat the purpose of having a wave pool that can mimic the beach.
30,Website offers lowest price guarantee or price matching plus 10% . I pulled up a third party website that offered the same room same time frame for much cheaper. The person at the desk seemed lost and said that they dint offer price match. I pulled up their own website and there it was in black and white. Still didn't honor the request.  I was tired and wanted to rest so I refused to continue to argue.  Not honoured
20,Nice hotel but very expensive for what you received. Pool only open 9 to 6. Anything you wanted like food or coffee very overpriced. They charge $50 if you put anything in the mini bar fridge and charge you $400.00 up front as a deposit on top of making you pay your entire bill up front. They claim the $400 is credited quickly after check out. I hope so.
50,Room was very nice and clean. Unfortunately every drink or food in the room were sooooo expensive. When we had a noisy neighbor security took care of it promptly. Animal scratching noises in the ceiling--kinda creepy.
10,"We reserved a double queen but when we checked in there were none available. We had to wait an hour to get a cot delivered to the King (for three people) we still had to pay the full price and even though they said they would take of one day of ""resort fees"" for the inconvenience at the end the did not. The bathrooms smelled of urine and there were stains on the floors of bathroom and chairs of the room. Impossible to reach guest services by phone"
50,Everything about this hotel was great. Rooms were clean beds were extremely comfortable service was excellent room service was yummy check in/out process was a breeze especially using the app. Rented a Beach Bungalo the pools were clean and food/drink service was fantastic! I visit Vegas frequently for business and pleasure and this was by far the best stay I've had yet!
40,The only problem on this hotel was that I needed more amenities in the room. Like an accessible fridge and coffee machine with complimentary drinks. I understand the purpose of have a fridge already filled up. But I have my own preferences and didn't have the chance to enjoy them in this room.
30,* Room was ok for price shower was one of the worst we’ve ever experienced - tiny with plastic shower curtain and terrible water pressure.  * Shampoo was horrible - literally felt like we would have done better picking something up at a dollar store.  * Absolutely shameful that to even touch a bottle of the water in the room I would be charged $20.  * No in-room coffee or microwave was very inconvenient (and no I wasn’t going to spend $5 for the in-room instant coffee).  * Pool chairs were literally on top of one another with little shade anywhere unless we were willing to spend $650 for a cabana (again shameful).  * Parking garage was the only convenient appropriately priced “extra” item.
20,The Mandalay Bay is too far from the action on the strip for walking there were too many kids at the pools and the dealers had zero personality. Lastly the rooms are nice but they charged you if you put anything in the room fridge and they don't offer complimentary water or coffee in the rooms. They even charge you if you touch anything on desk or in fridge even if you don't use it because it's all weight sensitive. This hotel seems more interested in making money then it does in guest satisfaction.
10,I Had a reservation for 2 rooms booked through a conference for Delano; I am an educated profession doctor and Executive VP for a company. Our Reservation was not honored at Delano and manager Ruth Gomez was absolutely terrible and out of line on so many levels. Does anyone give these supervisor customer service training or problem resolution skills. She did not have the ability to resolve the issue instead she said she would cancel the reservation and call security - which she did. Your security person Heather seemed to be more sensible. Neither person rectified the situation in the manner that it should have been resolved since we are at an MGM property.    The other female African American agent stated that if they are oversold they honor the guest by placing them in the 4 seasons. That did not occur. I explained to Ruth that we did not want to stay at Mandalay due to the shootings and murders that occurred in August of 2017 at the Route 66 concert. She was not empathetic nor had any concerns for my stigma in staying in a hotel where a mass murder recently occurred. Her response was cancelling a valid reservation that showed Delano Hotel and calling Security. HOW UTTERLY DISRESPECTUL IN EVERY WAY!!!    Finally It took over 2.5 hours to get a room. The first room at Mandalay Room 17-104 smelled like dog urine upon entry. Even your security agent Heather said that the room was not habitable.    My colleague and I were finally given 16-215 and 16-205 at 12 midnight on 4/22...205 was horrendous & had coffee stains on the bar & balls of hair and MOLD in the bathroom. I have pictures of all these items. The hallway had guests that were having a loud part on the night of 4/22 and smoking marijuana.    Lastly we were reluctantly offered a food and beverage credit that never occurred. I would like to talk to the General Manager of the Hotel. The experience and resolution were pitiful and disgusting - no one should be treated like this.
10,Upon our arrival my husband and I wanted to take a nap as we were exhausted and were in Vegas for work. I noticed there were two large stains on the sheets and pillowcase so I called guest services at 11 am to ask for new bedsheets and for the bed to be serviced.    2 hours had passed and still no one from housekeeping had shown up. I called back and guest services said “This request has been marked as complete.” I informed the young lady that I’ve been in the room the entire time and no one has been by. She said she’d ask housekeeping to come by. Long story short I called a total of 5 times and had to get VERY FRUSTRATED before someone finally came at 6 pm. My husband had already come back from work at this point and was so exhausted that he fell asleep on the couch. I had to miss out on the first day of my conference because I was so tired I couldn’t attend.    We later noticed that the rooms just generally don’t get cleaned after guests leave and they’re just made to look like they have. We found some old trash and a pair of socks behind the curtains as well as a lot of hair around the drain in the shower.    Speaking of the shower the water doesn’t drain and takes about an hour before it does. So while you’re in there you’re ankle-deep in suds and whatever filth is on the shower floor.
30,Had hair in my shower and called and no one never came to take cate of this problem so I had to use tub instead of shower shouldn’t have to do that at a room that I stay at also had to send food back three times at pool area ..
20,Family vacation: Pool pics sold us so we booked! Lazy river: You have to buy inter tubes for $30 each! Wave pool is a joke every 10 minutes one baby wave and you can’t just sit at the edge to wait for wave. Casino has weird smell. If you get food drink voucher good luck using it since everything had shortened hours. Neighboring casinos had more open. Keep looking!
20,Room hadn’t been cleaned couldn’t reach a human to resolve. There were food scraps and something white and sticky on the floor next to the bed. Clearly the room hadn’t been cleaned. I called the front desk and guest services and it just rang and rang. Couldn’t reach a human. I went downstairs to complain I’m person and there was a line of 50 people that I wasn’t about to wait in. We had tickets to see a show so we were forced to stay in a gross room. So disappointing. And $50 to store water or food in the room fridge??? What a crime. And a surprise “resort feel when the website advertises that the pool is free for guest use. Total scam.
30,We stayed Sunday to Wednesday. The hotel was too crowded it was impossible to find a place to sit at the beach area people were lining up from 8:30am at the beach entrance. Lazy-river and the hot tub are also exaggeratingly crowded. Coffee lines in the morning were sometimes over 30 minutes and don't dare touching anything in the room because they will automatically charge you ludicrous amounts for stupid things like moving the coffee-kits (without even opening or using anything).Location is a bit far from the strip center but that can also be an advantage. I found the bed and pillows not very comfortable.
50,Awesome pool loved the wave pool and lazy River. Great customer service. Room had a great view of the pool. Shark reef aquarium was fun but a little pricey. Overall a great experience. Loved the poker room.
50,From check in to the room casino food and staff everything was top notch! Take the monorail/ train to Luxor and Excalibur. Them walk from Excalibur to many different casinos. So much fun. Would absolutely stay at Mandalay Bay again!
30,If you check in and try to use your mobile key card to access the elevator good luck he will most likely have to go get a physical card to scan in the elevator so you can get to your room. And even sometimes of cards work and sometimes they don’t
50,Rooms are nice and spacious with plenty of table/counter space. Beds are comfortable as are the pillows. Bathroom is spacious and nice. Its a good overall hotel with plenty of restaurants and entertainment options. I will say the pool should be open later than 6pm but other than that my stay was quite nice.
30,I stayed at The Mandalay before in August of 2020 and thought it was such an exceptional hotel. This time not so much. There was less staff available to assist in certain areas of the hotel and the quality of my room was a little sub par. There was noticeable hair in the shower that was there upon arrival and the windows in my room were visibly dirty. Also someone actually took a dump in one of the pools and everyone had to get out while the pool was being maintenanced. This definitely left me feeling uneasy and not wanting to return. Too packed and under serviced.
50,We chose Mandalay Bay for our first stay ever in Vegas & we weren’t disappointed. Everything you could want is right there. You don’t have to leave the hotel to find great food shopping or a dance party! We will be back!
50,Have stayed here many times and will continue to stay at mandalay bay in the future  we have stayed at many other resorts on and off the strip and by far love this resort the best  just entering the building you can notice the aroma of a well kept place that makes it inviting again and again
10,We had a 2 king panoramic suite very nice room and great view. Picked the hotel for the great pool. $32.00 for a Mojito though? Coffee shop type restaurant off casino was fine. I was reviewing my bill mid stay and was surprised to see a charge from housekeeping for$150.00 plus $20 in tax. I inquired and was told the room was excessively trashed. I got mad said that it was not and they removed the charge and tax too quickly. Could they just put the charge on and hope you don't see it?    On our first night housekeeping came into the living room in the middle of the night 2am - 6 am. We never heard a knock but both rooms saw a light go on and then off and assumed it was each other. We were surprised to find a pile of towels on the ding bar.    Our last night I went to flush the toilet in the middle of the night no water. I rolled my eyes and went back to sleep. In the morning we only had cold water. We had to take cold showers before flying home. No explanation just again a real quick offer to remove the resorts fees off the bill. WHATEVER! We left more than disappointed.
50,Stayed 7 days with my daughters and husband and it was all amazing staff was great and friendly.. all in all awesome place to stay for the whole family... Great places to eat stores to shop in and even events on a daily basis
50,Beautiful and clean resort. Beds are so comfortable and staff is very helpful and friendly. The pool area is amazing as well. Nothing bad to say about this hotel. Kid friendly. It is a bit pricey but well worth it.
50,First time staying at the Mandalay Bay awesome room clean spacious quiet beautiful view. Love the bathroom. And housekeeping was incredible. Came to the room every day always checking to see what I needed. Love daily room service unlike other hotels.
50,Clean room and very spacious. friendly staff  great view. Great restaurants good gaming. Easy parking and I could find my car. Over all  great experience. Come see for yourself you wont be disappointed.
30,Then when it comes time to check out all kinds of extra unknown charges appear and the host won’t even reply back to you. Been waiting 6 days now and still no answers. When you’re there on site they can’t do enough for you. Not a great way to get you back that’s for sure.
50,Mandalay Bay Resort is always fun comfortable safe. Many great food choices. Wonderful pool areas especially the lazy river. We ate at Stripsteak great service and perfectly prepared steaks. Noodles also very good. Staff very friendly and check-in was super fast. Used the MGM app to check in in advance and our room was ready when we arrived about 1:00.
50,We were able to enjoy a beautiful outing as a couple in order to sightsee and go to the awards ceremony for the Latin American music awards at the Michelob ultra Arena which is part of the MGM Mandalay Bay entertainment area.  The staff was very helpful throughout the stay and always acted in a professional manner.  Extremely quiet to rest and also continuous attention to details by the staff and the cleaning group.
50,The view from our room was an extra treat for our kids. The view overlooked the pools and airport so the kids got to see the planes land & depart every 5 min. The hotel was overall clean. Our room was pretty nice for the inexpensive price of the room.
50,Stayed here for the BTS PTD concert at Allegiant. Was on the higher end price-wise but was worth it since was a celebration and special treat for myself. The hotel is incredible and was so convenient to the stadium. Also was so cute all the little BTS details that were around.
50,Our stay was wonderful. Beautiful clean very spacious rooms. The bathroom was so nice with the double sinks separate shower and tub. All the staff was so friendly. We loved the pools the only negative was that they didn’t open one of their pools so if you were waiting in line for 45 before the pool opened if it be difficult getting a chair at the pool. We will be back!
40,I absolutely love this resort. With Vegas being known as an adult entertainment hub this resort was family-friendly and not so over-the-top compared to other resorts on the strip. I had a wonderful experience at this resort and I'd come back here again.
40,bang for your buck at $169 when we booked it. The room was spacious and clean and up to date the bed was very comfortable however the bathroom was out of date but functional. check out at 11 but still able to use their amenities. Pool area was amazing like a beach. If you want the free beach chairs go right when it opens at 9am and if you want the cabanas book it waaaaay it advance because it’s always sold out a head of time.
10,Having just visited the Cosmopolitan and Bellagio service was everything.  Have just checked into this hotel with a late checkout request to be told at the point of check-in that this is not possible.  Had I known this in advance I would never have booked this hotel.  We have a late and very long flight home and the fact this hotel could not accomodate a 3pm checkout is very disappointing.  That’s OK -will not stay here ever again or spend any money in this resort.    No tissues in the tissue box not enough USB ports.
20,I really like this hotel but on this occasion our stay was not pleasant there were several situations of racism. and they only offered me some drinks as a reward I have money to pay for my drinks I only demand fair treatment
30,We stayed for 5 nights in April. The room had a great view of the Las Vegas strip...but the strong smell of pot in the hallways in a nonsmoking hotel was enough to make us think twice about returning.
30,Hotel room was fine but the conversations in the next room were quite loud. It was not an issue as it did not go on all night. If it did I would have requested a separate room with more soundproofing if there is such a thing.
40,The coffee/water refreshments in the room is not free. Doesn't even have a coffee machine that can make hot water. We need hot water to make milk but no way to obtain. Everything is room service required at a cost.
30,first room given would't unlock. went to front desk and was upgraded to different room 17402 to be exact. room had hair in bathroom and door looked like some one tried to pry open on back of door. not impressed but doable. heard lots of wind and whistling at window area entire stay assumed it was a/c and it was very windy those days at 17 stories it could be blowing on building hard. on day of check out my son discovered window was not connected to steal beam and there was a gap between pane and beam. at 17 stories that's scary and very unsafe!!
50,Checking into the hotel on the a app without taking to anyone. App worked on the elevator and room key. Pool was crowded but just went down and swam in the lazy river and wave pool. No need for beech chairs or sun loungers because none were ever available due to crowds.
50,We were completely satisfied with our stay. Everything was perfect. Our room was clean and large. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend Mandalay Bay for anyone staying in Las Vegas.
40,Stayed for 3 nights for my son's 21st birthday. The hotel itself is beautiful. The rooms are large and clean we just got a standard room and could not have been more pleased. The pool area is one of if not the best in Vegas.    Check in was easy with the app. Would highly recommend using the app for check in instead of waiting in a long line.    Only a couple issues:    1. The location is the very north end of the strip. You really have to Uber/Taxi to get to the main part of the strip. Would recommend this hotel if this really is your home base and want to stay eat pool gamble etc. there for your trip. Not the greatest hotel if you want to spend a lot of time on the strip.  2. Played Backjack and the table are right in front of a bar called Eye Candy. At night the music is blaring. Even was annoying to the dealer. Not the greatest setting when gambling when you can't even hear yourself think.  3. Everything is super expensive. Bottle of water - $6.50. Energy drink - $8.00. Vodka soda - $15. To be fair this seems to be everywhere on the strip nowadays - so just be prepared. Tip: Across the street is a Shell station and liquor store. Go to the Shell station and load up on waters and drinks. Go buy a bottle at the liquor store. You'll save yourself a ton of money.    But all in all great hotel and we had a good experience.
40,We had a very good time. We enjoyed our room  the food court restaurants and pool . Everybody was very nice!! I left my phone next to a computer while printing our boarding passes. A couple found it and gave it to James the guy at the convenient store in front of the computers and he returned to me . Grateful!
40,Overall good stay and nice pool/beach that other resorts don't offer. Minor issues like weak WiFi connection that causes issue with phone app elevator and room access. Some areas in the bathroom (worn floor tiles) are a bit dated.
10,There are more friendly and clean places to stay in Las Vegas. They only care about your money. Very challenging to navigate the building with limited signage. Food court was dirty and over crowded with no where to sit. Very difficult to use keycards in the elevator as it did not register 3/4 of the time.
10,I reserved 5 rooms I was not told that there was a late arrival charge when I called a let them know that I was returning late because of a plane delay.  Also we had to sit on the concrete because one of the pool was closed and there were no chairs even thou they had the opportunity to use the fence that they used to fence off the entrances to fence off just the pool and let the people sit in the chairs.  And one of the biggest waste of time was the Mlife rewards membership counter service where there was a average wait time of 20 to 30 minutes and the Mlife cards didn't work properly so I had to go back 3 times to wait and have new cards made.  And the housekeeping was way below average I was there for 5 days and they only cleaned my rooms 2 days out of the 5 days.  Also online check out was a joke I think they want to penalize you for not checking out of your room.
30,Watch out for the 3rd floor rooms on the roof level they have half a window. 11am guaranteed early check in didn’t mean “guaranteed” so many kids running around at the pool and no adult pools open durning the week of our stay.
50,Mandalay was very nice. The staff friendly and helpful. They really try to accommodate for everyone during high traffic times. When asked to check in well before normal time they didn’t hesitate to help find a room that was ready early. Highly recommended.
50,We had a great time with our friends in Vegas. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The pools and lazy river made for a nice relaxing day and a break from the casino. All of the restaurants that we tried were clean and the staff were all polite and accommodating.
50,Great Hotel! Friendly service the room was clean it is a little far down on the strip though. The staff are very friendly the check in and check out process was very simple. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
40,We asked for an upgrade and I was told half off and we had paid already on line and then I was charged 400$ more. It ended up being no discount. I felt bait and switched. I won’t stay there again due to this. Also the Strip steak restaurant was very slow with the food even though they were not super busy.
20,Very noisy rooms (right next to airport and busy road) horrendous cold and bland breakfast way overpriced food and drinks and casino devoid of any atmosphere.    The beach area is the only saving feature of the hotel but on balance it just doesn’t make up for how poor the rest of the resort really is.    Too many other far better options in Vegas so I’d avoid.
50,Booked Mandalay Bay room and was so grateful for the location being super close to Allegiant Stadium and the airport!  Super friendly staff at front desk and housekeeping.  The beds are so comfy and they have a separate tub! Friends loved the wave pool but I literally stayed in the lazy river for hours LOL
10,i was ignored over charged failed to deliver a invoice check out was impossible room service was late 2 hours and failed to show up altogether the following night. i needed a cart and they would not give it to me
50,Place is really great. Walking distance to our concert venue. Lots of things we can do during our stay. Great food a little pricey but everything is delicious. Would recommend to everyone. Love our 2 nights stay.
40,Stayed at this hotel to attend the BTS concert. Great location and walkable to the stadium. Hotel is very nice clean and the front desk at the priority check-in was quick and efficient. It was very airy inside hotel and the air was fresh not stale or smoky.  Room was clean and comfortable for 4 people for 3 night stay. Walls are thin though so you can hear conversations next door.  Shower water pressure was awesome. We had in issue with the sink but they fixed it right away. No complaints except the overpriced food at the Cafe for the BTS-themed menu which was average tasting and the manager kept trying to rush us out to clear our table for the next guests but it was fine because I had a good time with friends. This will be my go-to place when I come back to Vegas. I love my MGM rewards!
40,The pool was terrific the ranges of the restaurants were great. However the rooms and the casino floor both need some attention. It appears that they have been outdated and are in need of refurbishment. They beds are very soft but not in best way. They were uneven with some form and some soft spots.
50,We chose MB for the pool this was a family trip with 10 & 6 y/o kids plus 2 m/o baby. Pool area was great fun but very crowded with almost no shaded areas. Lounge chairs and daybeds were sold out on a Monday even though other online reviews said there is no need to book in advance. As for the hotel we loved everything about our stay at MB from easy check-in upgrade to a high floor room huge room and excellent dining options. The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable and I slept very well. Room and bathroom were spotless and updated a big deal for me. The only down side is location - the kids got worn out from walking to other areas along the strip. The tram was helpful but you still have to hike quite a distance to use it!
30,We understand that most businesses had to make up for lost money during covid but there has to be a limit. We’ve never stayed in any hotel where the crappy coffee in the rooms weren’t free. $12 for 2 disposable cups with who knows what in them was ridiculous. I’d rather pay at Starbucks than pay for that. There should be clear signs in the rooms for guests to see the prices of all items. $20 for a tiny little bottle of Titos is insanity too. Digital keys is a great idea but that’s only if the wifi and or internet connections to your cell is good.
50,The room was very nice the casino was fun and had a large selection of machines and tables to play on. There was a good selection of places to eat that offered very good food. I will definitely stay there again.
50,We absolutely loved our stay at this resort. They had everything we needed or wanted great restaurants very comfortable beds nice big windows clean everywhere friendly and helpful staff an amazing pool and a very fast and efficient elevator system. This is the perfect LV resort offering everything a family needs without feeling too big. We had such a great time there.
50,Had a great time staying at the Mandalay Bay. The hotel was beautiful and clean/ The staff was very friendly.  I also really enjoyed the contactless check-in/check out process as well as the virtual keys. It made everything super easy and stress free. Definitely will stay here again if I have another event at the Allegiant stadium. The convenience of the proximity was a major plus!
30,TV was not working operator staff was not friendly at all. Waited 3+ hours for the tech to come and fix the TV. Also was charged for the coffee $12 each twice when we never use their coffee/tea because it was too expensive.
10,Music at the pool was so loud I felt it in my chest on the 15th floor! My room was so far from the elevators I didn’t want to leave to go to the casino or to get dinner. I couldn’t sleep until after midnight due to the music (which was awful) at the pool.
10,My wife had a massage at the spa shop by the pool entrance. She liked it a lot so I made another appointment for her on the following day. We requested like we did for the first time massage a female massage technician since my wife and myself as well didn’t want herself to be touched by another man. My wife went to the appointment only to find out her masseur was a man. She ended up getting the massage from the male masseur with huge confusion due to lack of explanation from the staff what was happening. I found out what happened when she came back to the room and immediately called the shop with little bit of anger. Apparently someone in the shop changed her masseur to the male from the female very last minute on their own. First they tried to lie to me the appointment was originally made with preference of a male technician. I didn’t get fooled then they lied to me again it was a mistake on their end. I’m sure although not admitted or confirmed by anyone yet they did it so they could get another client and they knew exactly what they were doing. I brought this incident up to the hotel and was disappointed that the hotel didn’t want to be part of the situation.    The spa staff did what the manager told them to do. What makes me even more angry is that the spa manager didn’t care a bit to show us very little effort and respect to take her or his fractions of time and talk to us.  My wife and myself are Asian whose English is second language. I can’t stop thinking they took advantage of us because who we were and how we were. I feel bad the hotel was great but I don’t think we’ll be back because what happened in the spa.
30,Know that you need to purchase a lazy river pool float…they have no rentals. They are $30 on site. Bring one with you. Room was fine. Paid for early check in. Room wasn’t available until 1130am. Not a huge deal but I guess I was hoping it would be all ready when we arrived from airport. Found out if you want a place to sit at pool you need to get there by 730am. No thanks! Food selection at pool was very minimal. My 10yr old did play in the sand part by the pool and loved the wave pool. Lots of kids. Would I stay again? No-I’m going to try somewhere different.
50,Line at front desk check in went quickly. Michael was amazing. I’m a local and we were treated wonderfully. Room was gorgeous overlooking the pool on the 28th floor. Pools were fabulous we love the lazy river that’s why we come back. Check out was easy and parking was taken care of. Thank you Mandalay Bay we will return asap.
50,We will be back for sure!  - The room was clean.  - Aquarium  - Lots of restaurants and in-room dining option  - Pools are fun. Need to get there first thing in the morning to get chairs.  - Free Mandalay Bay Tram - Access to Excalibur and New York New York Arcades M&M museum and more dining options
30,I am a loyal MGM customer I particularly like the Mandalay Bay staff they are friendly and engaging and most seem to have worked here a long time. Few things I noticed this trip and I don't want to seem ungrateful for the hospitality of reduced rate or comp rooms. First the rooms are tired. The shower had mold in the corner that was caulked over and the walls were absolutely not clean the soap looked unwrapped and used. Kinda picky but also in a word - gross...and come on we are barely comfortable traveling to begin with cause covid. There is nothing in the room that doesn't cost - like is coffee in the room or a bottle of water too much to ask ? Who wants to get dressed and ride the elevator just for a coffee ?The slots are not paying like at all. We gamely pumped $100's night after night and yes I realize slots are regulated but you know the feeling when just can't win. Food and beverage is well insane. Yes yes yes it's Vegas but bottom shelf one ounce of Vodka - $12 ? Couple drinks at the pool $40 before tip ? What happens when prices are ridiculous is people are driven to bring in their own food and beverage and that does not help the hard working staff - or it sends people to Fremont Street. Not quite sure how a family of 4 comes here any more. I noted the prices are the same regardless of level of MGM property. The pools are obviously a big draw but be warned shade starts at like $375 for a cabana so while I guess you can feel like a rap star the rest of us normal folk may not last long in the sun....and you have to fight for a chair. The moment you stand up 10 people rush you asking for your chair haha. Not sure how long loyalty can last MGM and if you design the experience to keep people trapped into paying for literally everything they will get tired of it.
50,Really clean lots of stuff to do and great service. The room service was really good and the staff for the room service was phenomenal. Naturally in vegas the night life gets a bit a edgy I would love to see a little more security around the hotel.
50,stayed here for 4 days lovely hotel great beach with wave pool rooms are clean and spacious everything you need can be done on the tv to checking out and checking flight status it is located at the end of the strip opposite the airport great if you are a plane spotter you can walk to luxor and excalibur hotels or there is a free tram which stops at both casino is not really my thing but if it is there is plenty to choose from the hotel also has a shark reef aquarium which is worth going to see there are lots of resturants at the hotel but didnt use them staff was very helpful and housekeepers did a great job would stay here again
50,Second April in a row we stayed in a one bedroom penthouse on the 60th floor. Arrived shortly after 1600 and our room was ready and clean. The coffee maker wasn't working but we quickly got a replacement and $50 credit.  Staff is absolutely amazing. Tons of great restaurants. Trams are up and running slot machines are paying. Could only use the pool one day before the wind storm came. So nice to be back to a maskless vegas. We LOVE the location of mandalay bay and we love needing a key card to access the bank of elevators up to the super high floors.  The view of the Delano tower and allegiant stadium plus the extra bathroom is a an extra PLUS. See you soon.
30,A family of four comments nice property and kid friendly. We enjoyed the aquarium very much and is well suited to young children as it is a 30 minute experience. We paid extra and got the strip view which also had views of the airport mountains and desert in the distance. We appreciated the view from the 13th floor as being on the end of the strip you get the feeling of being away from the craziness. As for sleep quality our room was part of a suite and we had a fair amount of noise (at times) but nothing outrageous. Staff were generally friendly and some very helpful which was appreciated as we had an infant and young child in tow. Not all policies were clearly stated and we had baby items delivered to the hotel from a local retailer which went to the bell desk and were lost and one staff at the bell desk were unapologetic and cavalier inviting us to help ourselves to other guests items which were left at the bell desk and was heard complaining about tips. I did tip deserving staff regardless of this episode. Another negative was the pricing which was event driven and so on one night our rate was in excess of $600 and the following night in the region of $200. It easy to see why service suffers when the swings in pricing means you have differing expectations from night to night. We also found a lot of 'nickle and diming' with various charges for basis items such as US $35 per night for a mini fridge rental or parking not being included which again is  I think attributable to the events crowd. Overall we had a great trip the Mandalay Bay was only about 50% of our experience as we were busy exploring the Strip Las Vegas and the region during our short 4 days. Overall a cool family friendly property which did the trick for us.
50,I come to Vegas specifically to stay at Mandalay Bay. The pools are amazing absolutely love the lazy river and the wave pool. It’s such a beautiful property and you truly feel those vacay vibes. The atmosphere is inviting and the rooms are great!
50,We loved this hotel it had everything you needed. Big rooms comfy beds friendly staff several outstanding restaurants and shows. The casino was great and so was the pool/beach area. It felt safe and was clean. Wish there was an empty fridge to put your own drinks in. Overall a great place to stay.
40,The hotel was inviting. Restaurants in the buildings were amazing and the staff were very kind and understanding. Only major complaints are the jacked up minibar prices lack of fridge and restaurants closing too early. The wave pool was uneventful launching only one wave a minute. Lazy river was amazing though so worth it for that! Just bring a inflatable with you as they charge you 20$ for one. Would recommend if you bring a cooler!
50,This was our first time to Vegas and it was to come see the BTS concert. We had a room on the 11th floor and we were really pleased with how clean and quiet it was. It is definitely a resort because there are high costs for everything: water in room coffee snacks food pool innertube etc. but having to been a resort before this was expected. We were looking for inclusive and fun experience like you would get in a resort setting so we had a great time. If you are traveling on a tight budget with a family this probably isn't the best place since there are no fridges or microwaves in the rooms and you would have to bring in a lot of water food etc. and a cooler. It was the best location for going to an event at Allegiant since they close the over crossing to cars and let everyone walk across making it so easy to get to and from the hotel to Allegiant.
30,The proximity to Allegiant stadium is the primary reason why we booked Mandalay Bay. The facilities and rooms are nice and clean. This hotel is expensive. There is small sign that we missed regarding the ref and stuffs (water cup etc). We were charged even if we did not consume the water alcohol or soda or did not use the cup because we did not see the small sign that says we'll be charged even if we move things around. I complained about that daily extra charges so they canceled it. So do not bring any medicine that requires refrigeration coz you will be charged for putting it in the ref.
50,Room is vey nice we had a very nice view. Will definitely stay here again. Staff very helpful helped us with our room keys right away. Just wish they had their coffee as complementary as before would be great.
50,Wonderful only pitfall was the WIFI. I was on floor 27. End of a hallway. Signal was shoty. Everything else was exceptional. Room was quiet bed was great. Huge bathroom. Double sinks. Nice desk space for working. 2 comfy chairs to watch outdoors.
10,Nickle and dimed for mediocre rooms. Floor to ceiling windows were nice but that's about it. Charged for the minibar when it wasn't touched - guess using the glasses in the bathroom were the cause.... Had to sit in the sand with bottle caps and glass due to overcrowded pools. Don't let the 'stadium walk' fool you - it is simply an exit from the hotel onto a street which you 'walk' on and across the bridge to Allegiant Stadium. Smoke smell is strong.
50,We really enjoyed our recent stay at Madalay Bay. Stayed there with my parents wife and two children 8 and 16. Lots to do for everyone. Good food great beach and very friendly staff. This property has lots to do for adults but also is one of the best family spots on the strip. Best insider food suggestion. Irish pub between Luxor and Mandalay.
50,First time in Vegas... I loved the facility the service. The room was quiet for my autistic son. The Michael Jackson show was prepared with booster seats and ear protection for my son. This place is sensory friendly. My son had a difficult time when it was time to go home
30,Reservation got cancelled upon arrival for no reason and check in was long. Elite king suite view was terrible. The window bars covered everything and was disappointed not what was advertised. Beach/pool had zero chairs available even though plenty were not being used. People can leave a towel for a long time and we spent over an hour looking for a spot to sit. Finally gave up and put our stuff down in a corner to go into the pool only to be told we can’t leave our stuff there. Completely overcrowded. Housekeeping didn’t show up until 7pm even after multiple requests throughout the day. Staff was kind and courteous though.
10,We reserved a two bedroom suite with a panoramic view. We ended up with two adjoining rooms with a terrible view. Unfortunately we were stuck because our conference was at this hotel and we were exhibiting.
30,Staff was fantastic easy check in and check out rooms were great pool areas looked great but I caught some bad weather! It was just hard to overcome the smell of smoke and whatever they use to try and hide the smell of smoke.
20,During my stay and while were sleeping someone was able to walk into my room with a key that was not issued to me or any employee. They came in not sure how long they stayed but left leaving all their left overs on the table. The sound of the door closing woke me up. Totally bad experience this time around and feels like an unsafe place after this.
20,Location is too far off the strip if you really want to be where the action is. The hotel/resort had a strange smell to it and I had issues with our room with lights not working one morning the hot water did not work and could not get a hold of the front desk. Given the many options I would not stay here again.
30,I made my reservation over a month in advance and confirmed my check-in the day before my arrival. I arrived at 4:30pm and was told my room was not ready yet but it would be shortly so I waited almost 5 hours and finally got a room at 9pm. Worst check-in experience.
10,Service was terrible. I did not even have towels in my room. TV did not work and it was 40 minutes to get hold of guest services. All this for an extra $40 resort fee a day YEAH. There is a coffee maker in your room but you have to pay for the coffee why isn't that in the resort fee. The mobile app does not work well you have to have internet service for it to work and when the elevator door closes there is no service... which means it won't activate the elevator to get you to your floor. So you still have to go to the desk for a key. I was not the only one complaining about that issue when I went to the desk.
40,The Mandalay Bay provided a memorable experience while attending the BTS concert at Allegent Stadium. Event was within a safe and easy walking distance. Restaurants closed too early for family diners and amenities at market shops did not list prices and were expensive.
10,They held an event the weekend we went shunted us in the back way gave us no direction and then our digital key didn't work! The staff was rude and unhelpful. The whole experience was the worst stay we have ever experienced at a hotel. EVER.
30,Reported that I got stuck on elevator multiple times due to card not working they replaced card still didn't work. A maintenance man had to let me off the elevator. Hotel price was reasonable but the surrounding general stores were ridiculous and staff rude.
50,It’s a beautiful hotel and you should definitely experience it at least once.    It smells like the beach and you can find anything you need inside.    I was treated amazingly by every staff I encountered.  I got a pool view and it was amazing until the last night they had a pool party with a dj and I could feel the vibrations all the way to my 24th floor. Luckily it ended at midnight.  Visited the shark reef and for $30 I didn’t think it was worth it we went through it in about 20min.  The food court closes early the only think opened was subway and it was about 10pm.  Visited citizens and seabreeze. Has amazing service and food was incredible also at good prices compared to resort Vegas meals. Citizens had delicious and strong cocktails perfect place for solo dining.    About transportation I’m so used to traveling and Lyft/Uber has become a commodity but Vegas is really made for taxis. So I recommend taxis to go around the strip and airport it’s way faster since the pick up is always at main entrance and there’s already a line waiting outside hotels/airport. Also the rides share at most hotels are hard to find and all the way to the back something that sucks since you’re most likely avoiding to walk more than needed. Also there’s a tram from mandalay to Luxor use it! It’s free.  The room was spacious and comfortable bed was amazing and pillows not too soft nor hard just perfect. And it had a huge tub!    I’d say cons are that is the last hotel of the strip so more walking if you’re planning to go out. But if you’re going to the allegiant then it’s the best option since bridge is right there and you can walk easily.  Oh and I noticed more cocktail servers during the day than at night for some reason.  On the first day after checking in I left and I always place my do not disturb hanger but at night I came back and house keeping had come in I don’t know if the hanger fell when I left or if it was ignored but made me feel very cautious after that it didn’t happen again tho
50,Great hotel for families there are many amenities and restaurants available. The pools are the best for if traveling with children compared to other hotels on the strip. The only downside is Mandalay is a bit far from the strip and you will be paying $15 cab rides to and from whenever you want to leave the hotel.
40,My sister and I decided to stay at Mandalay Bay for our visit to see BTS in concert. The location could not be beat. The room was also very comfortable and the staff were all very kind. A really great experience overall.
10,Pool closes too early and staff aren’t too helpful or friendly! Pool concerts are ridiculously loud couldn’t sleep and ear plugs took 2 and half hrs to be delivered. Never again! Not worth the excitement!
50,Attended the BTS concert and it was a really quick walk to Allegiant Stadium over the Hacienda Bridge. The hotel was really nice and modern and staff was friendly. The app was easy to use to check in digitally and notifies you when your room was ready. So never had to stand in the check in/check out linges. I wish I could have stayed longer!
50,Just stay here and check it out for yourself. Go stay somewhere else and then you will know why you are better off here! Great food great service great rooms? great class of people that come here and expect a little more since you pay a little more.
40,The room is very nice and very clean.  The bathroom is exceptional. The lazy river and wave pool also nice my family enjoyed our stay. Staff are very friendly always smiling. We’ll definitely coming back🤓
50,We had a great time as always at Mandalay Bay. We really love the location and the variety of restaurants and other activities available there. It was a little too cold for the pool this time but we'll be back.
20,We arrived at Mandalay Bay to check in one of the rooms was not clean and no one could give us a completion time. The food was over priced and under whelming there were no vegan options. The hotel check in staff were not very helpful in getting anything resolved and phoning from the room was about a 5 minute wait for someone to pick up.
10,We booked 2 reservations and asked for them to be combined so we don’t have to check out twice & move rooms.. Craig at the front was very nice and helpful & said since we had a suite for the first night we could be upgraded if we give up our suite since it wasn’t available for the rest of our stay. We had a larger more comfortable room for 2 nights then received a call on the 3rd night saying that we had to evacuate our room due to a engineering problem the same day as our concert was scheduled. I called the front desk and they said there’s no way we can postpone it and so we had to rush and pack everything up and move rooms then had to wait in line for hours to get into the concert and ended up being late for our concert and missing the beginning. And when I asked about the room being upgraded she said it was the same square footage but it was obviously smaller. Having to switch rooms turned into a really inconvenient trip and I was highly dissatisfied with the service. No one even came up to help us move all of our bags and the elevators to the room they moved us to on the 29th floor were ridiculously way longer than the elevators to the 60th floor we were originally on. I really like the hotel and we have stayed there numerous times and would love to stay there again but if this type of service is being offered then I’m afraid we may have to look elsewhere for our next trip.
50,This hotel once again delivered for myself and family. The room and services and especially front desk and all pool area staff were great. The Hotel was very clean. Pool area is awesome and well maintained. But if your looking for quiet this is not the pool area for you though. Fantastic Stay Highly recommend
50,The welcome at the front desk was warm and friendly confirming for me that I had indeed made the right choice of hotel. I had arrived two hours early for check-in and expected to have to wait for my room but I was told it was ready and was given the key right away. Awesome!! The the hotel itself is beautiful and my room was very nicely decorated comfortable and pristinely maintained. Even casual encounters with staff were quite pleasant. Perfect location for attending my event (BTS!) at the Allegiant Stadium a very easy fifteen-minute walk. I was super happy with my stay!
30,Housekeeping was maxed out and skipped us assuming because BTS was in town so it was packed and they told us we were not the priority - Sunday priority is turning over rooms. Also a band at the pool Sunday night kept us up all night even 58 floors up the windows rattled. If you prefer a quiet room ask to face away from the pool. Overall a nice resort be prepared to walk or drive if you want to go anywhere else on the strip as it is at the very south end.
50,We stayed at the Mandalay due to its proximity to Allegiant Stadium for the BTS concerts. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the standard king room and the layout of the bathroom. Everything about the room provided a frictionless experience and we had tons of restaurant choices without having to go off-property. Signage through the casino was plentiful and helpful. The only time smoke bothered me was when standing next to a person with a stinky cigar. Nothing but good things to say about the stay.
50,Room had a marvelous view and was very comfortable. I just wish the staff told us more about the hotel and the amenities. Everyone was super helpful best service came from the bell hop when we stored our luggage after our stay.
50,Close proximity to allegiant-walked to our event lots of good eats and several convenience stores best sleep friendly & helpful concierge housekeeping and floor staff the phone app is a great plus checking in and out is a breeze.
20,How disappointing is it to come back late evening to the room just as I left in the morning. Trash can is full bed is unmade wet towel still on the floor and no fresh towel. No housekeeping service was made during whole my 3 day stay. If you are wondering I didn’t have “Do not disturb”sign on the door while we were away.  We were only happy about the swimming pool and the size of the room. Shower didn’t feel clean.
50,Was quick get away trip was great for my first time at Mandalay Bay went to the Moorea pool had a great time got a little sunburnt though oh well all in good fun. Will definitely be coming back to Moorea for my birthday in July
50,Good Customer Service Nice room. A Great Rewards Program Beautiful Resort. Good Selection of Restaurants and Live Music at night is Nice! 2nd time staying here and will be my go to spot from now on when we go to Vegas.
30,Beds are very comfortable. Food court should be open later on a saturday night. they closed earlier than 9pm except for Subway. Pools are great and that is the main reason why we come back to Mandalay.
40,My family including 3 kids ages 1 3 and 5 stayed for 6 nights in 2 adjoining rooms. The hotel and grounds are lovely and our room was very quiet for the most part so there was no issue with sleeping kids. It is nice to have sand on the beach however lounge chairs cover most of it. It was a little disappointing that the pool closed at 6:00 p.m. every night.  The tram between Mandalay Bay and Excalibur is great when you want to get out to the rest of the strip however it would be nice if on weekdays it would start before 10:00 a.m. since kids tend to get up early.  Be aware that going to the central part of the strip involves a lot of walking if you have little ones.
50,Excellent time and so ease to get around and everyone helpful and nice  Not crowded and very easy to get service and quick elevators and nice maps to get around loved it  We didn’t get to go to the pools but we will be back and was close to all things and trams back and forth
40,Nice place but beware of hidden fees. If you pick up a bottle of water that is supplied in the room and put it back immediately without drinking it you will be charged. They are on weight sensors. Don't use the fridge either the same applies. And service fees at checkout are ridiculous especially when you don't use the stuff they are charging for weight room shuttle etc.
30,Biggest drawback is lack of functional refrigerator. There is one in the room but useless as it has bar items for only and no room to put your own things. They charge extra $50 for alternating the setup.
50,We had a wonderful time and will definitely be looking into staying here again. Not only Mandalay ready for the influx of people but they managed to contain and help all of the people that entered the hotel to get to their final destinations
50,A great value!! Nice large room good food options and great pool area for family!!! We knew it was at the end of the strip…. But still gets tiring to get all the way back at the end of the night. I recommend taking advantage of the two free trams! One from Mandalay and the other from Park MGM.
10,They called the bride and groom 9 days before and said they couldn’t honor their reception because they couldn’t justify operating costs with their $2000 minimum. Once we checked in they gave them the wrong suite. Once they arrived and called down saying they were in the wrong room they were told it was double booked and they couldn’t get in- which lead us to have to switch rooms one hour before we had to leave for the ceremony. Once in the suite- we were charged $1 per cup and per plate because they didn’t provide anything despite it having a full kitchen. We went to the new reception site at the foundation room and nothing was set up- it was basically half of the patio roped off. No water drinks food. The server only gave us the bottle service menu. I could go on and on. Never again- I’m seriously shocked at how poorly the wedding party and guests were treated.
20,They only thing I found great was the front desk staff and the location. Everything in the room was very smelly. bathroom was not as clean as I experienced before. NO MAGAZINE IN MY ROOM! Bedding looked like it wasn't washed so I had to ask for new bedding. Room was so loud. plumbing was not great and the shower had so much build up. Not a 4 star value on this stay for the price.
40,We stayed at the Mandalay for 5 nights from 06 April 2022. Loved the hotel vibe and felt at home there staff in all restaurants were fabulous and this made us feel welcome. Our room was fine very functional and practical but we felt it needed a spruce up to make it top notch. The air conditioning was faulty and we had to call the engineer twice in the middle of the night to replace the thermostat he was Rony and again  a fabulous guy and couldn’t do more to resolve the issue. That said the maintenance is lacking to keep up standards we lost a night’s sleep due to the air conditioning problem.  We would chose to stay here again excellent for access to the Allegiant Stadium but hoping the hotel will fix the problems to up their game in a very competitive market. Loved Vegas and will be back.
30,Keurig coffee machine no coffee cups creamer sugar no garbage bags no wash cloths Kleenex holder had 4 tissues stuffed inside not a box of Kleenex cheapest tp. Could have contacted housekeeping or front desk but I shouldn't have to gone are the pre arrival checks at this place.
50,Had a great time at the Mandalay Bay Resort—-plenty to do right on-site. Amazing family friendly facilities—wave pool lazy river hot tubs and pools were all top notch. The whole facility was very clean and beautiful.
50,Had an all around great trip. Our first room was ready yet but they set us up with another right away. Staff was friendly courteous rooms were clean pool was great an all around great trip. The rewards program kicks in right away too. (Comps for next trip ready for booking).
10,Room lacked basic amenities like bathroom trash shower soap and free cup of coffee. Staff were rude and unhelpful. Signage confusing and parking was too far away had to walk through the entire casino.
50,This is 1 of 2 favorite hotels of mine here in Las Vegas & I've been coming here 2-5 X per year for over 30 years! This resort is excellent: beautifully designed in & out great casino with multiple game choices good food excellent air quality (unless a smoker is right next to you!) beautifully appointed rooms with great views all around (and for me the best yet: BIG deep bathtubs!). I have always found the staff to be efficient courteous & friendly . This is a place I recommend to friends & family.
50,This hotel is beautiful! I personally like that it is not in the middle of the strip because it did not feel as congested as other hotels . It is super clean  updated  remodeled and overall a great experience for families  couples or business trips. The spa area was remarkable! I loved my massage and experience ! The pool are was huge. I would definitely recommend to all!
40,I had to hunt someone down to get our food. It took an hour and forty min just to get our food at the pool area. It was cold.  Overall the whole trip was good just seems over priced.  Cabanas at the were $700 with no credit towards food not drinks.  We ordered room service breakfast for our little one and it was $70- it was All-American breakfast and ordered OJ Coffee for $70 plus a $10 charge for room service.  The day before my niece ordered a burger and a slice of cake for room service and it was $60 with the room-service charge.
50,Hotel is beautiful and well maintained. The pool complex is fantastic. I’ve stayed here several times and have always enjoyed it. I will definitely come back my family enjoys this hotel every single time.
40,This is a very friendly nice place to stay for a few days in Vegas. Self parking can be hard to find but everything else was above the bar. Food options are many. Staff is very helpful. Food was great. Price is fair. I will stay here again.
50,Loved the spa and the shops and the tram service between the 3 other casinos there. The food options are great. The check in and check out and guest services are great and staffed with helpful friendly staff. Other hotel staff (pool and spa) were younger adults and could use some training in friendliness customer service and professionalism.
50,The hotel gave great convention rates since we were staying multiple days and the convention was already quite pricey. The rooms were simply and eloquently decorated and there was no Vegas odor which is my biggest thing. There is no more complimentary coffee and it might take you a while to get in touch with the front desk but those are my only extra thoughts. I had a great stay.
20,I get it- it’s a casino. But it’s one of the casinos in Vegas that are marketed more for families—the aquarium the their well known pools. Well rooms don’t have fridges just a mini bar (even post COVID!) no changing tables in bathrooms gaping door seals between connecting rooms so you’re welcome to hear your neighbors shower was slow to drain with mold on seals and door and don’t even bother with mobile check in or mobile key- you’ll spend many a times on line waiting for customer service.    On the bright side their pool area was nice (lazy river was not heated though) and their aquarium though small was one of the better ones we’ve visited.
20,Told to “Roam” because our room wasn’t ready close to 5pm day of check in.We we’re exhausted from trip and couldn’t and didn’t want to roam. Wanted to check in for what we paid for for the night. Pool area needed more staffing too.
50,The same tropical smell greeted me that I remembered from my last trip here after 13 years at the entrance. The rooms are nice but not too expensive. The pool area is the best on the strip. I do plan to come back.
50,I've been to three conferences held at the Mandalay Bay/Delano and the location is an excellent venue with everything you need to have a successful conference with a comfortable stay with excellent restaurants and enjoyable activities nearby.
50,Room was quite clean and very comfortable. The pillows were great – helped me sleep like a rock after long days. I also appreciated the level of quality in the furnishings. Didn't feel cheap or dingy.
50,Great pool great room! Not the best location on the strip if you want to be accessible to other locations on the strip. Also not many late night eating options. This place is quite family friendly with the wave pool and aquarium.
40,I would have given 5 Stars but we had no housekeeping on our final night of our 3 night stay. After a morning and afternoon out we went back to refresh for dinner and our room was not cleaned - I called and was assured someone would clean the room after we went back out (after 6:00 PM per my request). We went out for a fun night on the town and got back to our room at 1:00 AM and it never was cleaned. When I called they said sorry and asked what they could do so I said send up some clean towels for the morning - they said it would be a few minutes - they arrrived at 2:00 AM. We had to be out of the room at 11:00 AM with NO late check out an option!
50,This was very enjoyable. I had never been able to stay at Mandalay Bay before. The room was beautiful. very clean. The hotel staff was very friendly. In the casino the machines allowed us to play. Thank you for such a great time.
20,Rooms have paper thin walls. You could hear everything next door. Restaurants close early from 3-5 and then 10pm. Starbucks line was over an hour. Food options are limited. Digital key/WiFi didn’t work.
50,The hotel was excellent. The room was beautiful and they have an amazing staff at this facility. The pool area was amazing as well. We had great food and a great time gambling at their casino. The hotel is very quiet and keeps problems away. You are far enough away to avoid Vegas bums but not too far away to the action.
20,Only option for coffee in the room was to use a pod type system that cost $12/cup. No robbers in the room. Housekeeping did not refill the empty tissue holder. The thermostat was very unreliable. Mandalay Bay needs a major overhaul.
50,We were enjoyed our stay at Mandalay Bay. This is our third trip to Vegas and first time at Mandalay. We will definitely stay at Mandalay the next time we return. The room was clean spacious and comfortable
10,Worst staff ever  They dont answer to any questions  Messed up my complete stay  Had to pay parking at every mgm property even after staying and paying for valet service  Later got to know other mgm property parking was free
10,I booked a room for the bts concert initially through booking.com. When they announced the bts rate I decided to cancel my booking and book directly through mandalay bay. When I checked the rates there was an mgm rate which was cheaper than the bts rate so I debated whether to go cheaper or get the photo cards. In the end I went with the bts rate to get photo cards and booked. Immediately it spat out two bookings. I quickly cancelled one and checked the other one was fine. Didn’t think anything more of it until I check in and there’s no photo cards. I ring down to reception and they said I did not book the bts rate I was on and off hold for over an hour and had no resolution. Thoroughly disappointing they didn’t even agree to reduce to the lower rate since I missed out.
40,My stay at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino was great. The staff was very helpful and the rooms were nice and clean. The parking was very convenient because I was able to park at other MGM resorts on the Las Vegas strip.
30,too big and too smokey. too many kids and just too big to get around easily. smelled of weed a lot. long lines at restaurants for breakfast...make a reservation. we were shocked at the DAILY resort fee. that should have been included in the room rate.
50,Got a comped 2 bedroom suite through the rewards program. Check in was all electronic never had to go to the lobby. This hotel sits optimal at the beginning of the strip so there’s less foot traffic than Normal. A tram is available to take you all the way to the Excalibur to save some walking time. Plenty of places to eat and games to play. I will return!
50,Two-bedroom suite was great with a beautiful view! Very clean and quiet and the staff were quick when needed.  Nice to be able to choose go-green for housekeeping.  Pool was open and had awesome weather
30,Mandalay Bay has been our favorite hotel for many years. But this experience was sub par. Appeared the hotel is cutting down on many things to save money. Rooms not as clean. Terrible water pressure in the room. They didn't even provide a shower cap! I only saw one woman doing house keeping for the entire floor. Prepandemic you would see multiple people. It just had a different vibe that this is not the 5 star hotel it used to be!
30,This was our second time staying at Mandalay Bay and this experience was a little bit better than the first but we did see inconsistencies throughout our time there. Our room was the one thing that had the most inconsistencies upon check-in. When we entered our room we could tell that the room was not completely cleaned or they were rushing when they were cleaning it. When we arrived there was milk in a refrigerator that was left behind by the previous guest there was water still in the ice bucket with no new bags there were glasses missing from the ice bucket area one of the beds was not neatly made there was hair in the shower and the front door was ajar when we got there. We didn’t complain about it because we could fix those small things ourselves but it was disheartening when compared to the other mgm properties we’ve stayed at on the strip. We had a great time at the beach and in the pools. We had excellent service with Dee at the Mlife rewards desk. She was so kind helpful and really explained everything to us. We had a couple issues with our bill and although we were checked out yesterday and everything should have been fine with our bill I’m still receiving charges on my account from our stay. I had to call down to the front desk twice while there during our three day stay rectify issues on our bill and it’s a little frustrating that I’m still having to address this after we have checked out. We are hoping that this was just something that happened with this stay because we really liked staying here with our kids. So hopefully things will get rectified correctly and we can have a another chance at staying at Mandalay Bay with a more positive experience.
50,Excellent service as always at Mandalay Bay. Our room upgrade was spectacular! The casino is always the cleanest on the strip. Although it's a walk from the middle of the strip it is 100% worth it. Beds are comfortable sheets are great quality housekeeping is spectacular. Check out the Foundation Room when your there for a great view of the strip and cocktail.
50,My husband and I were there for the Culture Tour/New Edition Charlie Wilson and Jodeci. Amazing concert! Mandaly Bay was more than what I thought. Sooo much to do at the hotel and so many amenities.
50,This was our second stay at Mandalay Bay and both times we were not disappointed. Good atmosphere and very clean. The staff are very helpful and kind. Citizen is our favorite restaurant in the hotel for breakfast.
50,As always your staff or kind and courteous at all times. Your cleaning staff did a great job cleaning my room. Your casino staff were friendly and did a great job. I enjoy the new Slots. I also enjoyed Tim McGraw concert right seats and great show.
50,Staff was awesome. Great stay. Check in was simple the ap on the phone was awesome. Staff was excellent and the hotel was very clean. Tables are a bit high priced but overall a great visit. Thank you for such great service.
50,Love Mandalay. Going to be hard to not stay here every stay. Resort is amazing and staff was great. Tram to Excalibur made it super convenient to access all Southern properties. Stripsteak was one of the best meals that we have had while in vegas. Loved MJ ONE.
50,Nice hotel nice shops good food nice shows I don't gamble so tried to find a place to go dancing I really don't have anything more to say so will not take another survey if this is required so this part probably needs to be changed
50,All the employees were so nice and helpful. The room was clean. The whole building was clean. Wish they would have told us ahead of time that all the coffee and water in the room were on a sensor and you were charged for just picking them up to look at them. They were very nice about removing the charges though when we brought it to their attention. Had dinner at Fleur and it was wonderful.
30,Nice room but having the insanely priced mini bar taking up the only fridge offered is enough to make me look at other options closer to heart of the strip. Not sure what the scent they're pumping into the hotel is but it smelled liked burning rubber to me.
40,Easy check-in (via mobile). Nice size room. Enjoy staying at the resort. One of my favorite places to stay at while visiting Vegas. The only knock is the location. Great pool area with lazy river. Nice restaurants. Plenty of variety.
50,"Mandalay was beautiful and wonderful but everything was EXPENSIVE!! I wish food was more affordable. EVERYTHING was pricey and we could have done more if things were a bit more realistically priced. Slots EVERWHERE were tight. I don't know I'd grade our visit a solid ""C""."
50,All good. Good value. Happy employees. Nice room. Good location. The only other thing I can think of is that I wish I could have won more. I basically just broke even. I don’t know what else to add.
50,It was good. The Hotel is always great. The rooms are clean. Room service was amazing! I only had one issue with check out when I requested payment be on one card and was assured but that didn't happen.
50,Very enjoyable !! My sons and I had a tremendous time. Maid service was excellent we did even know they were around. Everyone on the hotel staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. This was our 4th time staying at your establishment and that won’t change. To much fun!
50,The room was perfect and the staff was kind and helpful. The property has so much to see and do. And the tram between casinos was so helpful. We stayed at the Luxor for one night and the Mandalay Bay was hands down worth the price.
20,"My husband and I stayed here in November 2021. We decided to come back with our kids this time and enjoy the pool Shark Reef etc... We rented a cabana on the day of check in. I can't imagine I'm the first person to ever rent a cabana without having a room #. Despite showing our QR code that was emailed to us we were pushed to the side and told to wait while they validated us. I could see the desk ~ 20 yards away but they wouldn't allow us in. Once they validated us via our name over the walkie talkie we were allowed in. ~ 2pm I received the message that our room was ready. My husband left the cabana went to the parking garage and retrieved our luggage. Someone had already pressed floor 10 so he didn't need to use the ""digital key"" until he got to the room. That is when he found out the ""key"" didn't work. He went back down to the extremely busy lobby and decided to put the luggage back in the car. He then waited in the line to get ""real keys"". He went back to the car to get the luggage for a 2nd time only to find that the key didn't work for a 2nd time. Back down to the lobby and a phone call to me since I was the main person on the reservation. I had to leave my kids in the cabana alone while I went to the lobby to get this sorted out. I asked the customer service agent Alex to get a manager. He told me they were all busy and asked how he could help. I explained the situation. He made another key and told us they should work. I asked him to take us to the elevator to make sure. I also asked that a manager contact me regarding this upsetting situation. We were able to get into our room. However I was never contacted by a manager. They don't care about their guests or the troubles they have. You're just another number to them. I signed up for the MGM Rewards card after our last trip and was supposed to get free parking with my Pearl status and they still charged me for that too!"
20,Over rated 2 bedroom suites . Never buy the VIP lounge . Get early check in  IN writing when traveling from out of state. We were stuck for hours with my 3 kids and preganant wife. We rented a cabana and spent more money than anticipated just to have a home base to chill . Arrived at 8 am no early checkin on suites even though we paid for it  and couldn't check in till 4
50,the pools were amazing there’s different pools and area the bathrooms was spacious the bed was comfortable. great view any room that you get. i didn’t have to wait long for check in i can’t wait to come back
10,Checked in at 3:00 and the room wasn't ready. Was told it would be prioritized and I had to wait. Finally at 7pm was able to get into my room. Not able to use the resort at all bc they wouldn't give me a key to get into the pool area until room was ready.  Room hadn't been cleaned well at all hair in the tub and along the moulding in the bathroom food and crumbs around the bed. Had to call the front desk and have them come clean the room again.  Joined MGM Rewards in order to apply the discount to the room rate. When checking out I noticed the discount was not applied. Had I not spent the time to review the statement before checkout and speak with a manager it would have gone unnoticed.  Terrible experience.
30,Do not touch any drink or food items in your room. If you even knock something over or pick something up and put it back down it’s an $18 charge each time. Location sucks far from everything. food not that good.
20,Mandalay is a great hotel but there are a lot of kids running around the property. It boggles the mind why parents would expose their children to adult Vegas behavior and entertainment but for some reason Mandalay Bay encourages children to stay here. They roam unsupervised playing on elevators. If you’re not bringing kids choose someplace else to stay.
40,Great staff check in terrible. The parking is confusing it says  Delano there is no clear sign to turn for Mandalay Bay parking and the person could not tell us how to get there. I had to ask a Vallet for directions.
50,My husband and I went for our 18 year anniversary with our friends abd next time we would love to bring our kids with us to enjoy the pools and all of the amenities such as shark reef with them. Thank you for a wonderful mini vacay! I wish it was longer but maybe next time and hopefully we can get a big suite and experience the luxurious hotel rooms that we cant get back at home.
30,Mandalay Bay has been a great hotel in the past. We’ve stayed many times. This time around it’s really showing it’s age and the quality has gone down hill. Our room wasn’t as clean as it should have been. We found boogers throughout the room. Hair in the shower & dirty towels with black stains on them not to mention the towels weren’t soft either. The biggest frustration was the air quality. The smell inside is really really bad now. The cigarette odors are overpowering to the point that all my clothes worn inside the property stink. We wanted to gamble but the air quality was so bad my sinus’ couldn’t take it. They were immediately swollen from the time we checked in and stayed that way. We had to find activities off-site because the odors were just too much. I know this is a popular family resort but I wouldn’t want to take my kids here with how bad the air quality is.
10,No toiletries. Tub didn’t work. Awful black stains on sheets. Casino crowded and no drink service. The woman who checked me in was fantastic everyone else could have cared less. Pool still great and saving grace.    Nuff said!
50,Stayed in MB and it was great. Friendly staff and great customer service .. Been comin to Vegas since the eighties and this is the best I have seen. I always enjoy MB and will stay here next time in Vegas!!
20,The cleaners did not put any sheets on my bed. I didn’t realize until the morning I was sleeping on just the mattress. I didn’t think I had to look before falling asleep. This is something that should never happen. Absolutely disgusting.    Everything was overpriced and there was no place to get water other than the room unless you wanted to spend $35 for a bottled water.
50,Rooms are beautiful and comfortable views are amazing pools are fantastic. Lots of food options only wish things were open later. Prices are high but you get what you pay for. This is my 3rd stay on this property and I will keep coming back.
50,Added an extra kid to our stay. They were out of roll away beds and very crowded at the hotel. We had a fun time and had lots of other parents with kids and had a great time. It was also perfect weather
40,Mandalay Bay is always very accommodating and very pleasant. It may not have the glitz of some of the other premier properties. However the staff are very friendly and work hard in the casino hotel restaurants to make your trip enjoyable. I usually stay at Mandalay Bay in the summer to enjoy the water features but this trip was to attend the BTS concert. It was very crowded due to a volleyball tournament with 700 teams but it never seemed overwhelming. The restaurants were decent but have yet to return to the standards and quality that were present pre-pandemic. Hopefully things will continue to improve at Mandalay Bay and in Las Vegas general. I definitely notice that the current status of all the properties have yet to fully bounce back from Covid.
50,Attentive employees clean rooms tons of shopping & restaurants without leaving the hotel. Had a great getaway with friends! Spa services were top notch as was service at our pool cabana! Can’t wait to go back!
40,First night was a little rough. The air conditioning unit was banging each time it turned on. The next day it was fixed and was quiet the rest of the trip. Some of the staff we encountered were rude. We expected better service for the price. One thing we were not aware of was you had to buy a tube for $32 for the lazy river. Not great to have to pack that for the plane ride. We did rent a cabana for a day and that did come with two tubes and we were able to get a couple more for all the kids.  Overall we enjoyed the resort and had a great week.
40,The suite size was nice but there’s no lighting within the room. The phone didn’t work every time I needed to order room service front desk or concierge help I was unable to. That became annoying. I called days ahead to arrange my room request and they were not met. Employees were great and friendly only reason for a very good score.
40,We booked one of the bigger rooms a two-bedroom suite. Coffee wasn’t even included! There was a coffee maker but if you used it it was extra. It didn’t even have a mini refrigerator! We booked the bigger room because we brought our two teens. We figured we would have a mini frig considering the size and price of the suite but we were disappointed. The snacks we bought we had to throw away. That was re biggest downfall of our stay.    The location is amazing! The hotel is HUGE! There are so many restaurants and choices from fast quick marts/stores coffee shops ice cream cafes and high end restaurants. The casino is clean and very nice. It’s in the heart of the strip and you can take a tram to nearby casinos.
40,The property was fabulous the views the room and restaurant are great. Beach restaurant proximity to the beach and pool area provides great relaxation and good food. My only complaint is not having the room cleaned on Sunday my last day before checking Monday
10,The charge for EVERYTHING here to use the fridge ($50) coffee in room ($20) etc. Ice machine for entire floor didn’t work. Was offered a bucket of ice but never came. Was not significantly impressed with room accommodations for the price paid. Will NOT stay here again. Friends stayed at Circus Circus for a LOT cheaper and had better service. Ridiculous. Felt taken advantage of and just wanted to charge us for every little thing.
20,After booking the room with a brand new never been used credit card (that being the only charge) the next day there were several fraudulent charges to a go fund me account.  The floor we were on had no ice.
20,Cons: lack of elevators room was dirty concierge was careless air quality in the rooms was very bad pool is crowded cafe overpriced food court closes at 6pm. Pros: non. Last time at any MGM Hotel
30,The staff is great. Location restaurants shops etc. are all great. The rooms and hotel need to complete makeover badly. Dirty the bathrooms are not clean and the doors do not operate without squeaking
30,You need to know about the minibar! Do not open it. They will charge for opening it! The only coffee in the room is charged when you take the plastic off the cups. So if a child were to open this you are charged. Bring pods and cups as a work around.
10,Paid for late check in did not get it. Used mobile check in was told to wait around with no estimate of time. Went to front desk to get room. room lacked essential (no shampoo etc.) hand towels had to request. The $39 per night resort fee is high way robbery. The hotel seems dark and dingy.  The 6th floor room facing Allegiant Stadium sounded like there was a helicopter over your head at night. I think the noise was from the air condition units on top of the concert or convention roofs.
30,The Self Check In process needs attention. It's slow and we had to wait for a text to get our room. What am I supposed to do in that time? I want to check in and go to my room. Not have to wait in the lobby for a text. Then my room card keys were disabled twice once when we reached our room and second time at the elevator. Both times to get them re-programmed we had to stand in line with the other customers. What a waste of time.
50,clean rooms. easy mobile check in. was not able to purchase pool chairs I was told they were sold out but I saw a ton of chairs not being used. I wish there were enough chairs for people to sit on while enjoying food and drinks.
50,Clean spacious tropical I booked a stay well king room. It was very clean open had plenty of storage. The only downside is that you can’t use the fridge to even store personal items without being charged $50. I like the extra amenities that come with the stairwell room like air purifier aromatherapy and the water infusion.
30,I booked directly through Mandalay Bay but upon arriving was told that they did not have the room I boked. After a long back and forth with email proof of the room I booked they finally got us in the right room.
10,Room service for two: coffee breakfast burrito bagel with cream cheese oatmeal. $110. Brought to the door in shopping bags served on disposable tableware and plastic utensils.    The food was cold and the coffee was bad and served with the kind of disposable creamers you get at Denny's.    $1200 for two nights and some of the furniture was damaged the mini-bar was not fully stocked and someone else's hair was stuck to the wall of the shower. Were there supposed to be robes? There were no robes.
50,Business trip where I brought the wife along. Always tough to get time between meetings and work but was able to experience a lot of what Vegas has to offer since Mandalay has so many venues to chose from and easy access to the Tram.
50,We had a wonderful stay during a volleyball tournament. With as many people that were staying there the hotel was well run and clean. We didn’t have to leave the hotel at all. They had everything on site. Thank you!!
10,Check in was not what I expected at all. We didn’t get in one of our rooms til 9pm was told to stay close but no one informed us it was available. Was told we 100 credit but we had to double check for that as well.
50,The wave pool is a must for kids despite the long lane to get in the morning.. and there are always seats in the afternoon. The place is clean and safe and there are shows everywhere. good food and rest.. excellent spring break vacation!
50,If you want the feel of a getaway to the islands stay at Mandalay Bay! Beautiful relaxing and everything a resort should be.  There’s something for everybody. Everyone who works there had a pleasant customer service attitude! Good help is hard to find especially nowadays! Thank you for making a vacation a wonderful memory.
30,Drinks are horrible in casino. All mixed drinks are flat and pure syrup.    Rooms are dated and breaking down. The restaurants are understaffed and food itself is very bland or overcooked. Staff is ok not excited but they will help you.
50,We stayed at Mandalay Bay because it was the closest hotel to the Allegiant Stadium which we had tickets to see the BTS concert. Every staff member was very polite and helpful. We really enjoyed the many different pools. The sandy beach was amazing for my two little girls. We brought our beach toys and they played for hours. The lazy river and wave pool was an exciting sight to see. We would definitely stay here again. It was a much needed vacation after a long hiatus due to covid-19.
20,I stayed at the Mandalay Bay on a Wed-Sun trip for a bachelor party. The beds are really comfortable and the shower was very nice. The staff was friendly. My WiFi stopped working on Thursday and my TV stopped working Friday. I called the front desk to report the issue and no resolution was offered. My in room entertainment was Netflix on my phone using my cellular data. For a hotel to charge a $40/night resort fee you should make sure your systems are working. Very frustrating.
10,We paid almost $400 a night to stay here there were no towels in the room. We picked up the room phone to dial the front desk only to find it broken. There was no number listed anywhere for us to dial from our cell phones. So we had to go 14 flights down to front desk to ask for towels and a working phone. One hour later still no towels or a room phone. We go back down to the front desk to ask again and we are treated badly by the front desk staff. They basically just tried to send us away telling us housekeeping take care of it because they were too busy. The service at this hotel was despicable. We will never go back.
10,This is a great place for a party not for a good night of sleep hotel does not have sound proof Windows and it is next to the airport you can imagine that. Rooms next to ours were having a sex party  We could hear everything until late hours of the night ( or morning you could say) hotel staff does nothing about those.  Go to party and find another place  To sleep.
30,Checked in through the app provided all that was requested. Did not get a room until 2.5 hours had passed. No ice during my three day stay at all. Also you will be charged $12 for the privilege of making a cup of coffee with the kit provided in room. Staff was nice though not their fault. Room was not bargain rate I expected better. Wave pool was nice.
20,Understaffed overbooked lines of 50+ people at every coffee kiosk and quick serve restaurant. The food was horrendous at almost every place we ate at the service in the restaurants was horrible. It seems as if they raise the prices when an event comes to town. One of the only hotels on the strip to charge for parking
50,I’ve never stayed here before this trip but from now on this is my Vegas hotel. The rooms were awesome the service was great and the food was great. I love that they had an app and we can manage our parking and our check-in and our rooms and our check out all on the app!
30,Very poor return on price of room. I felt the price was over inflated because of local venues. Everything was also extra including coffee and tea. Dining options extremely busy and expensive. The food court was very dated with few food options.
50,Great resort. Clean. Superb amenities. Easy to connect to other resorts trams etc. Staff was very attentive and friendly. They were handling guests in town for a volleyball tournament day before we checked out and it got a little crazy and wait time for our elevator section was a little lengthy but overall would return to this resort in a second!!
40,We stayed in a double queen strip view room. It was spacious and clean. Love the double closets. The bathroom is larger than any other queen room I’ve stayed an in Vegas complete with separate toilet area double sinks shower and soaking tub. Not my first stay here and won’t be my last.
50,We stayed on the wellness floor and the infused shower was lovely. The air definitely felt clean and the mattress was great. Check in was a breeze. We were excited for the aquarium and it was so much more awesome than we expected!!  Great customer service- we kept running into issues with our key card leaving the parking garage and staff was there to help immediately.  We didn’t get a chance to try out the restaurants or bars but we’ll definitely be back!
50,We had a comped suite for this trip which was fantastic. The hotel has a fantastic pool area. Get a cabana for the day it's worth the money. The service at the pool was wonderful. The only negative is that you are at the far end of the strip and it's a lot of walking. Use a taxi or Uber which is cheaper than the monorail if you have a group.
20,Stayed from Tuesday to Saturday and was struck by how crowded the hotel pool and common areas felt . There were so so many families with young children it resembled Disney World not Las Vegas. That’s fine if you expect it but I was unprepared. Every place you went it was no separation. Very uncomfortable. Won’t stay again.  Rooms were average view of the parking lot . Generally it feels old and passed by .
20,Reserved room at (MGM) Delano. Received confirmation email. No physical destination address on email. Drove to Delano. Downloaded & set up MGM app enroute. Bought prepaid self park. Entered Delano/Mandalay parking structure. Prepaid QR code for parking didn't work. Called contact # on app No person answers calls recorded message said closes at 5. Gave up on self park effort as no signage to indicate where we could enter Delano or Mandalay. Friends arrived Delano 10 minutes earlier told it was sold out & MGM had changed our reservation to Mandalay but didn't notify us. Decided to valet & request our $15 prepaid parking fee be applied to our bill. Seeing how bad service has been we decide to drag our bags to room. Friends who used bellman didnt get bags for several hours and then only after callung asking at belldesk tipping asking again. Bags went to Delano. Finally make it to elevator surprise digital keys don't work. Anticipating errors I also go hard keys. Fall back belief is that no one and nothing here works. Elevator frustration felt by all. We get off at wrong floor and decide to use stairs to go down 1 flight not to be all doors under red EXIT signs ( to stairways?) are locked. All emergency exit doors are LOCKED tried key no luck. We go back to elevator and hope someone would get out on friends floor so we could take them snacks for diabetic daughter whose cooler was stuck in baggage limbo.
50,I was very satisfied with my recent stay at Mandalay Bay. The reason I gave the score of the five because my dog was able to stay with me on the resort. I was treated very well. I will stay again at Mandalay Bay due to the service I was provided.
30,Everything besides our $350+ hotel room and MGM rewards for military members was great. The hotel ceiling was leaking from above and for the amount we paid for that shouldn’t have been there. For being military members the mgm rewards did not reflect that we were pearl members.
30,Not much of a party During the week.  No food options after 9p. Beach dance party was not happening.  Fees: daily parking resort fee.  Pool insanely busy before 9:30am.  Rent a pool space for convenience: high  price.
30,The walls and windows are too thin. We can hear the airplanes from the airport and a ambulance from the street. That’s considering that we were on the 13th floor. We were there on a volleyball trip and my daughter and I did not get to rest much.
50,The Mandalay Bay provides the best customer service I have ever experienced! Staff will always go above and beyond to make sure there guests are comfortable plus the Mandalay Bay has an amazing view of the Las Vegas strip! I gave location a 4 star because it is all the way at the end of strip but there are amenities that make up for it! The Mandalay Bay is so worth it I look forward to staying with them in the future!
50,Stayed for a recent volleyball tournament - which was held at the hotel - very convenient! As always the staff was super nice and grounds/hotel were awesome! This is always are go to when in Vegas (especially for tournaments!)
50,From the moment we entered the experience of checking in either by mobile or face to face with a representative was pleasant. The room was beautiful and so was the view dinner at the Strip Steak excellent and breakfast was excellent too. Checking out was easy and fast. No problems. Will go back someday.
20,Waited over 3 hours for bedding to be delivered for the pullout. 12:30am. My son was passed out on the couch and I could not go to sleep waiting for the delivery. Room phone was defective and could not call down. Could not call the front desk using my cell phone since it was after 9pm. We were in an “elite king”. Mattress was horrible and sagging.
50,Got married here 12 years ago and this place always has a special place for Gina and I. Kids love it and with the tram it makes it super easy going back an fourth to the hotels without needing to walk.
50,This was my first trip to Vegas and the entire staff at the Mandalay made it a great experience. I Would definitely recommend this resort for a family or individual who’s in need of a little get away.
30,Nickled and dimed for everything ... no in room free coffee no mini fridge VIP lounge very lacking in amenities! did not like the overall layout of the property just not for us. So close to airport there was significant airplane noise as well.
30,It was a nice place to stay but the pool we wanted to attend was closed.(found out two days before our trip) we got charged extra for items we never used on top of another fee from the fee already paid in our bundle package. Very disappointed about that.
50,Clean safe and has great amenities. I have stayed at Mandalay Bay a few times and recommend this spot. It’s at the end of the strip so not as crazy with foot traffic and the casino is a bit more chill however the pools food and entertainment are fantastic.
50,We loved our stay at the Mandalay Bay. The hotel was clean including the rooms. Staff was very friendly and informative. It is located at the south strip but we were perfectly fine with that we actually preferred it that way. Would definitely return to Mandalay our next trip.
50,Had a wonderful time staying here at Mandalay Bay. From the pools and lazy river to all the other perks the hotel has to offer there is no doubt anyone who stays here will love it. I only stay at Mandalay when in Las Vegas.
50,Mandalay Bay is a great Resort and Casino for many years for my family beautiful location and special rooms to enjoy to rest time and good protections services good restaurants  nice shows and great swimming pools to have beautiful funs.
50,Over all I have great experience for my 3 rd visiting at the hotel I feel valued as a guess and I like the diversity of food concepts that the hotel provides so I was very happy with my family and definitely I will come back
50,Clean hotel and service was wonderful. But the wait for coffee in the morning was long. The elevator wait is terrible especially during check out times. If you can work around this it’s ok to deal with. But when you check out 11 am good luck with getting into an elevator with being packed in like sardines.
50,The hotel was clean the staff was very responsive and helpful. And the check in/out was very easy. The price of the room was great but that's because we went at the beginning of the week. Overall very good stay!
50,It was phenomenal great experience. One of my best friends recently got married and so we did a bachelor party trip and stayed at the Mandala Bay and it definitely met all of our expectations. I would recommend it wholeheartedly.
50,I tell all friends and family it’s the Best of Las Vegas has to offer  Convenient Affordable Location  Cleanliness Great atmosphere Shows and Restaurants!  No other hotel can compare in my opinion.
50,highly recommend this resort! Very Family Friendly!!  kids swam in the wave pool all day and got to make new friends !!!  Cabanas were comfortable we could wither hang out inside and watch tv on a comfy couch or sunbathe on the sand outside our cabana. Fast and friendly service !! Food was fabulous and delivered in just minutes !! Highly recommend for either families or singles. Something for everyone!!! Cant wait to go back !!!
40,Would be better if you offered coffee that didn’t cost do much if you use the coffee it charge d you the refill free on the snack cupboard????? Free coffe would be nice or at least cheap enough that you feel you can afford it
30,Cocolini-  I was here around 6:15pm on 4/6/2022.  The girl who took my order was obviously racist and was incredibly rude while taking my order. I asked her if there was any sugar in the cappuccino or mocha latte. And she was short with her response and looked super annoyed. When I paid she didn’t even tell me where to wait for my drink. So I walked to the front of the store and I heard her tell the lady who was behind me to wait for her drink on the right side. She made me feel bad for even coming here for a cup of coffee. Worst coffee experience of my life.
50,Beautiful resort! Great restaurants! The Noodle was a great restaurant ! The aquarium was also a great experience! Valley of Falls were beautiful outside! Great to take pictures by the Falls! Great weather! Beach pool was fun for my adult kids!
50,Great place to stay and play! Location is great with a walkway to Luxor and a tram to other locations! Friendly staff and food was great also. Beach area is beautiful! Rewards program is exceptional!
50,Mandalay Bay has everything you could possibly want under one roof. Gaming galore with the most space between games in Vegas. It is so nice not have a cramped feeling. Inexpensive meals to fine dining it is all there. Free entertainment to prime shows. Its all there!
40,It was our second stay at your property the first was about 20 years ago my have things changed.  We were attending The Pac 12 women’s basketball tournament. Staying at MB was absolutely ideal and we’d certainly do it again.  Our only negative was we had to ask for a second bar of soap. Transferring from shower to sink seems unreasonable.  And when we asked for wash cloths we were told they didn’t have any. That seems very odd.
40,Very much enjoyed our stay. The staff was very friendly they also kept the facility very clean. It was easy to navigate around the building. Very much enjoyed the food we ate. We were not there to gamble but everywhere we walked through the casino it was somewhat busy. The larger video machines separated really had the look that the rooms were bigger and you were not on top on one another.  We would return on our next trip.  Thanks!
40,Nice rooms and service. The sports book during March Madness was incredible. The atmosphere and service was exceptional in the sports book. Table games were a little expensive wish they would have a few lower limit tables added. All in all it was a good trip and I’m ready to hopefully go back soon.
50,Great elegant place to bring your kids to - they have a beach & pool area for the kids to do. They have great restaurants & shops. The room was clean staff are professional and helpful. There’s a Tram line that takes you to 2 other casino . No disappointment here - thank you Mandalay
30,Beautiful casino. The room was the 2nd to last at the end of the hallway which sucked but it was full that weekend so I understand. The bathroom has no fan and I wasn't staying alone so you had to smell everyone else. There is no way to prop the door open because it is so heavy (smashed my fingers!!). Also you cannot use digital key even though it is offered because even with the wi-fi you lose service in the elevators and then you cannot pick a floor without the key. So you have to get a physical key anyway.
30,Fast check in. Machines weren't paying anything. Lots of walking. Ice machines didn't work. No adult pools/spa. Too many kids! The restaurant we had dinner at was great! Casino very spacious. Signage for self-Parking not clear. Hotel room windows dirty on the outside
50,Great accommodations. Housekeeping staff very friendly and rooms were clean. The $100 meal credit and $120 slot pay was a great perk. I did lose my travel bag. I turned it in to security but it was never located.
40,I usually enjoy our visits here. the only thing we didn't care for were the changes to the M Life program. Our room was top notch and all of the staff were great! You can always count on cleanliness and comfort.
50,we had an AMAZING TIME. service was incredible surroundings were beautiful entertainment was top notch and i won some money to boot. i was worried there wouldn’t be enough for my kid to do but he was obsessed with the wave pool and the aquarium. the tournament of kings and blue man group shows may have helped ;) WE LOVE LAS VEGAS
50,Love everything about Mandalay Bay. We stay there whenever we visit Vegas. The lounges are great. The restaurants very good. And ALL of the staff from housekeeping to parking to front desk were always ready and willing to help us.
50,Great casino hotel and staff. Hotel check in staff made my birthday awesome with a room upgrade for a small cost. It was worth it the room was awesome. Great bartenders on the casino floor. Casino was clean and spread out. Even won a little. Would like to visit again soon
50,It was a excellent experience. Great room excellent choices of places to eat within the hotel good room service clean not smoke filled like other hotels/casinos. Easily accessible to other casinos and activities via tram or Uber (designated efficient Uber area). Check-in was so easy using my phone and obtaining access to my room without waiting in line. I highly recommend staying here. This will be my go to place to stay while visiting Las Vegas.
40,First stay at Mandalay Bay (after staying at adjacent Delano previously). I like the quiet south end of the strip as I can drive to other casinos and restaurants further down or off the Strip. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Also love the huge pools on the beach. I'll definitely stay here again.
50,Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino is one of my all- time favorite hotels. There are so many great restaurants and music venues in the resort. I loved having lunch at the House of Blues eating dinner at the French restaurant and listening to music at the Irish pub. Mandalay Bay is a real treat.
40,The view of the strip from our room was awesome! The bed was comfortable. It's absolutely ridiculous that there is not complimentary coffee in the room. You should have something to ride around. It's too big.
50,Just wonderful! I only stayed one night and I will be back! The room was comfortable and large for a regular room. The bathroom was large as well. We were on the side that hod a view of Radiers Stadiun. It was a nice view.
50,Spent 5 nights at Mandalay Bay - we booked for the pools and were very happy with the pool areas! Had a great time at the lazy river and main pool area.    Room was very clean and featured a great view of the Vegas Strip. Didn’t hear airplane noise despite being close to airport. Slept very comfortably in the hotel bed.
10,i should never have waited until 11:45pm to receive my room after cheking in at 700pm. I should have been put in another room or offered to stay at other MGM hotel. reservation should never have been accepted if mandalay could not honor it. terrible experience. i travel to vegas often for trade shows and work with many large companies. I will be sharing by story and not recommend Mandalay
50,Something I did for myself for my birthday. I enjoyed the space of the room. Despite us not having a remote in the room it was nice and the beds were comfortable I was able to relax and be able to use my bath bomb ❤️
40,MB is a cool place and if traveling as couples highly recommend. Families is a good place pool is cool but everything is way overpriced there IMO. Good food options plenty of gaming tables. All staff I interacted with were friendly and very helpful.
50,Mandalay Bay Beach was a wonderful experience with a wave pool and lazy river. It was my first time renting a cabana and the quality and service was excellent. The conference rooms were very comfortable as well.
30,It was a nice place but they provide NO AMENITIES. Want to use the coffee pot in your room? That’s $12. Want to use the fridge? That’s $50. I hate being nickeled and dimed and that’s all this hotel did
50,We enjoyed our stay at a conference held at Mandalay Bay - rooms were great staff was helpful and the shops and restaurants there were wonderful. The location is great and access to the monorail  makes it easy to get around. LOVE the beach!
10,At 11 PM our room was not ready. were told they would call when it was ready. At 1:30 AM we went to the desk and it was still not ready so they sent us to a room not a suite which we booked on the other side of the casino. My daughter finally got to bed at 2:45 AM
50,I had the pleasure to be serviced by one of the best front desk clerks ever! Robert went over and beyond to ensure that my experience at the hotel was memorable! He assisted me in every way possible!!
40,So overall a really great stay. The hotel is very clean the cleaners do an amazing job in your rooms.  Can’t fault the room.  What I can fault though is the horrendous WiFi connection in the room. When we complained we were advised that yeah they know it’s awful but it’s fine in the lobby! We actually had a far better WiFi connection on the Deuce Bus!!  The other thing I would fault is the lack of cleaning away other guests room service trolleys. There’s currently 2 on our floor in the corridor and 1 of those has been there for 3 days!
50,Great service friendly personel clean facilites spacious luxurios hot servers great view from hotel room elevators easy to navegate and get fast back into your room. Top of the line decoratons and exceptional food.
30,Stayed for a volleyball tournament. Expect 20-30 min wait for EVERYTHING from calling the front desk bell desk housekeeping or anything else. Trying to wait inline to speak to someone is also 20-30 min.
40,This was a yearly family trip/ visit for a wedding. We always stay on MGM properties because the pool is great for our kids and lots of space to swim. The rooms are great very spacious. Haven't won anything big yet but outlet time is coming. I hope.
50,Loved this place the staff was great plenty of places up eat. My kids really enjoyed playing in their pools. Their favorite was the beach one which I really enjoyed as well. We were there for Spring break and roll plan to go there once again.
20,Long lines especially for coffee valet behind roughly an hour just to get your car brought around; room rate changed upon check in; told they were at full capacity yet friends of ours checking in the same day were able to upgrade their room?!? Much more accommodating hotels just up the strip from my experience.
40,Staff was all very helpful and friendly location was near what we wanted to do/see(Pinball Hall of Fame/Top Golf). Pool was amazing and would have stayed another night if I could have. Would definitely return.
50,It was you would expect from a quality resort. Good food comfortable quiet room and pleasant stay. Nothing else for me to say. We enjoyed our brief stay in Las Vegas and would recommend Mandalay Bay to anyone.
50,Great service throughout the stay! From when we arrived and were greated to the expediated check in to housekeeping and the amazing food. Great trip will definitely be back again very soon. Had a blast.
50,The resort was clean and love the multiple pool options (wave/beach pool lazy river and additional pools). Great for adults teens and younger kids. We love that you can take the tram from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur and walk a few feet to New York New York and MGM. You don’t need a vehicle to be right on the strip.
30,The hotel is clearly experiencing the same staffing challenges as the rest of the country. They should recognize this and be flexible with their policies and fees (resort fee). They are not fulfilling the expectations that the fees warrant.
10,over 15 years of coming to this resort and being the only resort I have every stayed at in Las Vegas let me tell you how disappointed I have been on this latest visit.  In previous years I always asked one of your colleagues help me out when booking rooms here (Brittany Dobson) but since this was a last minute booking I just did the booking via the app (and don’t getting me started on the app you need to sort out your programmers as the app is bad for non US citizens).  From arrival nothing was really ready queues were long and just could not book anything including cabanas I was told there was none available for the 3 days we were here and always told to come back tomorrow I noticed not all were full rash day (and I was by the pool most of the day so know it was not used). Even when enquiring about the empty one was still told there were none available.  Now to my son who is in a wheelchair multiple times when asking for tables for dinner we ask for a table and first thing that happens they look at my son. Next there is a 30 minute wait. This is not a problem as there is a queens any way but because we stayed near the entrance others of 5 or more were asking for tables were going straight in. Because this kept happening I enquired why these people were going in to the answer these tables cannot accommodate him. I stayed he could walk a short distance but was ignored. This is discrimination and I hate this. When we did get in to the restaurant we were stuck in the corner away from everything if not for my wife I would have made a scene but I am fed up of this.  I could go on about a few other things but I think I will need to think hard about coming back here again as I had planned for twice next year in the summer and in November for the formula 1.
50,Excellent from top to bottom!! Check in was a breeze staff was fast friendly and efficient rooms were flawless and staff in all areas were very friendly. Cannot get enough of Libertine and Border Grill but really all of the food venues were at the very least very good.
20,The staff clearly needs more training on how to speak to guests. This was a comped trip via my MGM rewards card and we had nothing but issues with the comps were we given since day 1. Even though they were quick to fix some of the issues most they were not and did not even offer an apology when confronted
50,We chose Mandalay Bay because of the pool area since that is the most important thing to our teenager and they did not disappoint! we rented a cabana by the East Pool and it was great totally worth the money. We spent the entire day at the cabana by the pool swimming in the East Pool and walking over to float in the Lazy River (which was a little crowded/busy with little kids but OK). Our hotel room was spotless and the deep soaking bathtub was a great plus. There was another loud family in the room next to us and their kid kept rattling the door that adjoined the rooms in the middle of the night but they left after 1 day and all was well.
40,I love the Mandalay Bay. I do not like the forced use of mobile check-in nor the new ticket service they use (AXS is AWFUL). Also I don't like having my comps not show up on my account taking extra time at check-out to guarantee I am not overcharged (this should be automatic not requiring the guest to ensure it happens)..
50,This weekend was our first stay at Mandalay Bay. We knew it was nice but we didn’t know it was THIS great. We booked the cheapest room but it was amazing! The room was absolutely beautiful; it has definitely been refurbished recently. And it was spotless.    We normally don’t spent a lot of time at pools in Las Vegas but this was an exception. We had a great day there.
30,After spending thousands on gambling we couldn't get a $12 room charge covered. Unacceptable. The Casino Host gave a thumbs down. It had nothing to do with $12 charge. But it soured the entire trip and made me so mad. Basically ruining the trip over a lousy $12.
20,Bad check in- digital key didn’t work for many people had to wait in line to fix even after having to download app too smokey throughout main casino rooms had ok cleanliness (light bulbs were out). It would also be nice not to have to be in room for bell staff to deliver luggage. Otherwise awesome location.
50,Rooms are large and the beds are comfortable. Housekeeping does a great job! This is our favorite Mlife property! It's a little out on the strip but they have trams that take you into the Newyork Newyork area
40,Luke everywhere somewhat short staffed but the staff from housekeeping to convention area to front desk were all very nice. My only tif was the bed was a little lumpy and I wish there were more $1 machines that I normally play and they did not have complementary coffee. Other than those minor issues I enjoyed my stay.
10,Had to pay $65 for my two kids to use the lazy river. I can't believe tubes weren't accessible for free. There were NO umbrellas for shade by any of the pools unless you paid for VIP seating. I found this to be insulting and discriminating. I had to pay over $100 to see the sharks. I thought seeing sharks was included in the stay. Food was terrible at Citizen. Beds were uncomfortable. Couldn't use the refrigerator- I've never heard of that. $20 bottled water in the room that wasn't even marked with the price. Overall I felt like I was treated like a second hand citizen they were trying to scam for every dollar possible. Frankly I'm 49-years-old and of all the hotels I've ever stayed at this was by far the worst.
20,The service at the restaurants was terrible (Citizens & Sea Breeze). It seems to be this way for only people of color sadly. The room was dusty. You could hear noises from the faucet AC and hallways. Will not be my first choice moving forward.
50,We were completely satisfied with the Mandalay Bay. The slots were not as loose as other casinos but I did manage to hit a 1400.00 jackpot in my last night!! Yay!  We ate at Stip Steak and it was absolutely delicious! Our waiter Glenn was amazing! Can’t wait to come back!!
40,near the airport well organized for conventions mostly friendly staff. Wave pool is nice but annoying that you need to reserve seating that is close to the pool. Like most of LV the food drink and toiletries are very expensive to buy. Nice restaurants with above average food
10,Unbelievable the hotel wanted to charge me $ 50 because i put one can of coke inside the small refrigerator inside the room. so unacceptable. The size of the rooms for Las Vegas is small. Not very clean or update.
40,The rooms are gorgeous and clean. Restaurants are wonderful. Staff are great. But casino cocktail service non existent. I played for 2 hours at the same bank of slots and was never approached I would have gladly paid 15 bucks for a beer as I was so dry but no one came anywhere close. there was a convention with a closing party and the servers were focused on the tables where these participants all dressed in white were playing. The rest of us were not important I guess. Even though I played a ridiculous amount of money over my stay. That's ok. I'll stay here again as the hotel is amazing but I'll play at Bellagio or MGM next time.
50,As a seasoned world traveler my go to in Vegas will no longer be the Bellagio. At the Mandalay Bay pool towels were handed to me with a friendly welcome instead of being reprimanded for arriving earlier than opening hours. Front desk personnel escorted me to the counter instead of reminding me to watch for the person who is available yourself. The front desk agent did not discriminate me because of I didn't book a suite and still found a quiet high floor furthest away from guest elevator room for me. The housekeeper offered to come back at a later time to clean my room when I returned from my morning swim. She even remembered to vacuum the dusty floor when I only mentioned it briefly when I had to kneel down to plug back the twin reading lamp to its original socket behind the nightstand when I arrived the night before. I knew that it must've been another team member who did a sloppy job on 3/30 the day that I arrived. She never complained about any inconvenience on her part and took one for the team. After the 3/31 evening concert at the T-Mobile Arena I didn't have to complain to the Front Desk about my bill the next morning when I had to leave early to drive to the Disney California Adventure theme park back for the Food and Wine Festival. You can't get a better no-fuss stay for a decent guest like me.
50,Had a fantastic stay at Mandalay Bay during Shoptalk! The hotel and convention center staff were wonderful. Great rates considering the location. I'm excited to return to Vegas and would stay here again.
50,Definitely will be coming back soon! Professional check-in and cleanliness of the Mandalay Bay is excellent! This was a business trip for an event at the House of Blues. All staff went above and beyond! Bravo!
10,Get a key at concierge as a back up or suffer the consequences of thinking a digital key will work every time. We wasted a lot of time messing with failed system. Had to leave the elevator to get a physical key.
50,The rooms are outstanding and the bathroom is the greatest place of comfort after a long day gambling. The deep bathtub and the wonderful shower. We enjoy the restaurants that are in Mandalay Bay mainly the House of Blues. You won't be disappointed.
10,I stayed at Mandalay Bay for 6 days 5 nights. There was a leak on my floor throughout the duration of my stay. I had to walk through drenched carpet to get to my room and listen to vacuums and fans that were left out to help dry the area. Truly disgusting loud and a huge inconvenience! I wasn’t able to get proper sleep and was late to my conference because of this. Way overpriced and for this! Not to mention my shoes would get wet every time and I am now sick and experiencing asthma symptoms from being in this environment for 6 days! Not once was I offered a room change. Stay elsewhere!
40,We stayed here twice (beginning and end) during a 2 week road-trip. We couldn’t use the pool during the first stay because it was too windy but the weather was perfect the second time around. Rooms were clean and good restaurant selection like the Noodle Shop. The front desk always resolved any issues we had (esp Anthony) and even though we encountered a few grumpy staff (housekeeping and at the pool) overall we had a great experience.
20,Poor customer service. No one went above half effort. I asked what resort fees included for the $45 a night charge. I was told internet pool/ spa and fitness. I needed to E sign some papers for work and was unable to do so from my iPhone. I asked about using the computers and internet at the “business lounge” which is just a closet with 2 computers. They charged 40 cents a minute for internet usage.  Went to citizens restaurant to eat and was charged a 5% surcharge for my dinning. When I asked what this charge was for I was told because of Covid and for the maintenance of the QR code site for ordering. I ordered my food while in the restaurant using a reusable old school menu and did not order my food to go or as room service.  The room that I booked online was not the room that I received.  The rooms were very clean and quiet. The staff at the Noodle Shop were amazing. They went above and beyond during my dinning experience there. Even answered questions about things to do and see while at the Mandaly Bay. They were the only bright spot.
50,Hotel was very clean nice grounds  friendly staff great pool area room service was amazing and quick. All staff was very polite and helpful. Nice shows and aquarium on site beautiful stay. Would definitely recommend this hotel to others  only down point was how far it was from mid strip Ubers would be a great problem  Solve for this  cheaper then taxis
50,Great place. I love the beach and SPA. Very well designed and built. Good place to spend time with family.  The restaurants are great and you find all varieties. Things are well set and designed. It offers a magnificent view of the city at night.
50,The hotel is beautiful and the room was so nice and clean! The amenities were amazing as well. The casino was spacious clean and easy to navigate. There are so man food options and places to shop. There is so much to do!
50,We had an excellent stay. We came during spring break vacation with our grandchildren. We all had a great time. A room was wonderful. The food is great very tasty. And the shows were really good. The kids love the pool river. Waves. I would Highly recommend the Mandalay Bay
30,Let me just say exhaust vents. My room was on the third floor which was near the end of the hall and outside my windows were the exhaust venst form anouth Mandalay Bay building. They were very loud.
40,Lumpiest pillows I’ve experienced in a while. I even tried all 8 in the double queen room. All were super lumpy; made for a bad nights sleep. Also in room shampoo and conditioner were poor quality making user need to use more to even clean hair.
10,There was no staff to assist with issues. Our room had blood on the wall and hair in the tub. The check bag line at the end of our stay was an hour long and no one would assist us at Valet. I will never stay here again.
50,Excellent Experience I enjoyed my stay and the conference I attended. Everything was awesome 👌 this trip helped me relax and learn more information pertaining to my. Career. The venue was a perfect location
40,Out for a guys get away. Watch college basketball drink and gamble. Mandalay provided all that we were looking for and more. The Irish pub has a bread pudding that had me making multiple trips during my stay. Great long weekend and looking forward to doing it again.
40,Overall still our favorite casino. Would like to leave with some money on one of these trips. 😁 We love Vegas and plan on being there a couple more times this year. Wife’s 50th is in May so see you soon.
30,Enjoyable stay at hotel very clean great views and very relaxing. Some small issues such as ice machine being broken for our entire stay and not being able to access other floors (for good security reasons) meant unable to obtain ice. Did contact room service but not often succesful in getting any ice.  Liked that a coffee machine was provided in room but at cost of $12 a cup seemed expensive as did water at $20 a bottle and a charge of $50 if you used fridge for own goods.  Was not clear when booking with Expedia that self parking was $15 dollars a day.  A pleasant stay but 'extras' could soon add up.
50,I stayed at Mandalay Bay for a conference. The rooms were spacious and well-appointed. Check-in was efficient and rooms were very clean! The casino was huge and there were a ton of restaurants. Make reservations ahead of time we were not able to find anywhere to eat one night.
30,You will be waiting in line for everything restaurants are incredibly noisy (most are placed across from each other with open front designs competing for attention with massively loud music and from the slot machines).
30,Mandalay Bay didn't fullfil our expectations. While the pool area was fun especially the lazy river which our kiddos loved the room and other services are average at best. The walls are really thin and you hear everything that's happening in the room next door. the bathroom smelled like urine and the room wasn't cleaned everyday. There was a loud whining sound coming from the outside air vent in the window which woke us up at night.
50,My room was perfect clean and it had all the towels toilet paper and shampoo conditioner soap needed  the view was beautiful I had the stadium view the Luxor and the strip view in one waking up and sleeping to this view was an amazing experiencehad so much fun in the wave pool and the lazy riverThank you so much for your service
10,We live Vegas and precovid came 3-4 times a year. Coming back to Mandalay Bay we were so excited. Our room and floor had multiple issues that we had to take pictures and report. None of which were fixed or addressed. So disappointed.    Where should we stay next time?
40,However if you want to enjoy the resort get there early. Place was super crowded people were hoarding chairs. Everything else was fine. Room was super clean. Only complaint is that the hallway noises were a bit loud. You would think the walls would be better insulated. Easy check in and check out experience using the app. Never had to speak to a staff member
50,Our stay is and was exceptional and as expected from my previous stays at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino Resort! We didn't experience all we could have at the establishment but what we did do and experience was delightful
10,I stayed at the Mandalay Bay for the first time and I will not go back. As I originally got to my room it smelled like body odor there was trash on the floor in the shower and the toilet area smelled like urine. Then there was construction from 2 am to 5 am. When I called downstairs to understand what was going on customer service shrugged it off and sounded annoyed that I even called to ask. I got no sleep and had an important full day of work the next day. When I asked the next morning at the front desk if there would be construction the next night again the staff just acted annoyed that I was even asking and did not even apologize for the chaos the night before. Really terrible experience. I left exhausted.
50,Great resort with many restaurants and activities to choose from. Not on the strip but a quick walk to New York New York or you can take the free tram to the strip. Pool is busy but large with multiple swim areas and lazy river very fun.
50,The Mandalay Bay Resort is a great place to stay! The rooms were clean and I slept the best I ever have in a hotel. So many places to eat and shop. The casino is very large and the drinks are great! We were able to enjoy the pool service at the pool was fantastic. There are a lot of servers walking around to take your order any time. The walk to the convention hall is long so bring your walking shoes! Overall a great place to stay I will recommend to friends and family.
50,Stayed here for a spring break trip! Can I say this is the beat pool situation for kids. I spent many relaxing hours by the pool with a great cocktail while my daughter enjoyed the wave pool and the lazy river. The rooms are large and the mattress super comfy. The aux cord on the wall for the tv was a great addition not to mention the great smell of the entire place. We will return!
30,Beautiful and expensive. Loved the room furnishings and bed comfort Lighting was flattering but difficult to see. Would have loved some outdoor seating other than poolside. No lobby seating. I was longing for the sunshine during this stay and only could be found poolside. Long waits at the elevator and phone key app didn't work well. Gracious staff. Polite. Friendly.
30,I was charged for things I never touched. On top of booking online they charged my card 5 times! Not seeing it on their end.. workers walked in my room at 9am while I was naked. Knocked one time and came in. Never waited for a response before barging in
50,My wife and I had a great weekend at the resort. Check in was very convenient I was able to do it before our flight. There was plenty to do at the resort. We went to a pool party there and had a very good experience
10,Lost visa payment. Treated us like we were criminals even after proof of payment was made. We will never go back not a good atmosphere at all people being arrested in the Casinos. Pools. You have to pay $100 for a umbrella
30,"I ordered an omelet and coffee. $60 later I'm eating on a plastic plate with a plastic fork/knife and drinking coffee from a ""box"" of coffee all delivered in non-recyclable bags. Nothing in the ordering process (a QR code experience) warns you that traditional tray dishware silverware etc is not part of the deal.    I'm discouraged by the amount of plastic waste this one meal is producing. Not to mention the less-than-luxurious experience of eating out of a bag for $60."
50,Location is a bit off the main strip but the casino is huge ! It offers so many options to eat and the layout is exceptional. The casino offers an easy connection to the Delano and the Excalibur casinos without having to use transportation
50,Such an amazing experience at the Mandalay Bay! Our room was beautiful clean and overall amazing. The new security system with using your key to use the elevators made my friends and I feel safe and secure. By playing the MyVegas Slots App we received a Two Queen room for free and were stunned at how amazing it was! It overlooked the pool had a beautiful bathroom and was overall a great experience!
50,It was a nice getaway it was also really busy the hotel elevators were really packed and it was a hard time getting up and down to your room from the casino lobby and during check out Sunday afternoon it was really packed time spent getting down to the lobby about an hour
50,Mandalay Bay has very comfortable beds and very spacious rooms especially for the handicapped. One of my top picks on the strip. The hotel staff is very accommodating. If I called the front desk for something they were at my door in a matter of minutes.
20,Used to be one of the top properties on the strip. No it is run down dirty dank. Feels like a lower end downtown hotel now. Paper thin walls where you can here your next door neighbor snoring. Hallways and elevators were not clean
30,Hotel has not kept up for the price point and is worn and some out of date areas. Not terrible but just okay. The food outlets were not open when I arrived nor for lunch the next day except for a food court that was not appealing.
20,Out of the way location and severely overcrowded. Add to that the rooms are dated and subpar compared to other Vegas properties. Would put this hotel and its lackluster amenities way down the list of Vegas options.
20,Mandalay is well past its prime. The rooms are small and the amenities are on par with a La Quinta or a roadside Embassy Suites…. Except for free breakfast the mini bar has two paper cups and off brand coffee with powdered creamer for $12. No robes and tiny mismatched off brand shampoo and round out a very a unremarkable room. The pool is giant but chair to chair with very little room to move and the lazy river looks like the I-5 at rush-hour. Weird smells abound and the even the spa needs a retread. The upscale Delano Bathhouse was relatively small by Vegas standards and outfitted the Women’s lounge with a tv playing ESPN Rold Gold pretzels natural valley bars and again powdered creamer brewed coffee and Farmer’s Bros tea. More fitting for a crummy Conference snack table than a spa lounge.
50,This was my first time here and i must say i was super please. The rooms were great and there was no screaming or yelling heard down the hallways which was a plus. The staff were soo helpful. The wave pool was just awesome and the entertainment was cool. I am very pleased!
50,We took our two 17 year olds. We split our time 50/50 between family fun and an adult get away for the wife and I. The free tram and access to the entire south end of the strip at no additional fees was fantastic. The staff was very helpful directing us to the activities that two older minor children would enjoy. We had a family vacation and date night every night!!
30,We go to Vegas 2 to 4 times a year and even went during covid. We noticed this trip that the slot machines were really tight. Going so much and comparing it to other trips we really noticed this. Maybe we are wrong but we do not think so. The Grand jackpots seemed all lower that they normally are. Even during covid when we went and were wearing mask the slot machines seemed ok. We may wait awhile to go again.
50,I love staying here. The suites are always great. Staff cocktail servers slot staff everyone is always very nice to us. People complain that Mandalay is too far south. It doesn't bother me I don't even have to leave the resort. It's got everything that I need in one spot. The pool is the best on the strip. Nobody else has sand. The sand is one of my favorite parts.  And this is the only casino on the strip that I win consistantly. Every trip I have big wins on the slots.
50,Really enjoyed our stay at Mandalay Bay. The hotel was clean staff was friendly and the King room was great! The pool area was fantastic. They have a beach with sand a wave pool and a lazy river that you could float in for hours. My partner and I both love walking so the location was great however if you aren't a big walker you would need to use the tram to Uber to get to more central areas. The tram is located in the hotel so it is very convenient if thats the route you want to go. Would stay here again.
30,The property has a lot of potential. Once the vents get added to the bathrooms and the elevator key fobs get fixed it will improve the stay experience. Also once the charge gets removed for the fridge it will get improved as well.
30,Overcrowded everywhere during pandemic. Tram casino floor restaurants and even elevators. Lack of crowd control during pandemic. Not properly working app (door key) long time to get assistance at check-in counters due to crowd or lack of personnel.
50,Taveled to Vegas for a boys weekend with my sons. Mandaly Bay has a fabulous hotel and an awesome pool experience. It's at the top end of the strip but easy to get anywhere via taxi/uber. Staff is top notch and the view from the Foundation Room is just superb. Highly recommend.
50,Property is kept beautifully. Staff is friendly and curtiuse. Great restaurants. Pool area was exceptional kept very clean and a lot of fun. The slots were friendly . It is is a great place to stay at. Plenty of entertainment and things to do. Definitely coming back.
50,We were visiting family and needed a place to stay for just one night on a Sunday. We found a room at Mandalay Bay. They put us on the 15th floor overlooking the pool and spa. The nighttime view with the pools lit up was fantastic. The rooms were very modern and super clean and the beds were super comfortable. We will definitely stay at Mandalay Bay in the future. You should make reservations for dinner and breakfast.
40,The price is not cheap but the premises are incredible. Staff is well trained and there are a lots of sites to go within the hotel. The location is good also. there is tram lining Mandalay to 2 other hotels Very convenient. Shows store and restaurants are good.
40,I met at the hotel for a family birthday. Several members of my family came to celebrate. Everything and everyone that helped us was exceptional! I can’t wait to go again. The Boarder Grill staff really know customer service well.
20,The only positive during the stay was that the room was ready early. The rest was down hill from there. The room smelled of cigarettes. It was also likely to be above a kitchen cause each morning we smelled everything cooking and burning from there. You had to wait for everything. Also the fact that everything is nickel and dimed at this property. They can’t even give you free in room coffee anymore. Lame.
30,I reserved a room months Before arriving and they said they were sold out so they just gave me what they had. So I’m thinking it’s a first come first serve thing. Pool is nice great for families with kids
50,Best pools in Vegas! Love the band on Saturday night - good old rock n roll. Was charged $14 for something out of minibar even though I didn’t use anything - it wasn’t worth trying to get it reversed as we wanted to get on the road.
30,The property itself is beautiful. It is on the end of the strip so walking or taking the tram is necessary if you want to see anything. The Staywell suite is not worth the money. The room we stayed in did not have a usable fridge or coffee maker and it was still dirty even though we waited almost 4 hours before we could check in. SharkReef is not worth the admission price don't waste your money. The majority of the staff were friendly and helpful.
50,Had a nice stay during annual conference. Casino smell was ok considering people smoking but that was the only downside-having to walk through casino to get pretty much anywhere. Quiet clean room nice view on 60th floor.
50,We had a great family experience at this resort. It is a beautiful hotel with an exceptional pool and beach. There are so many restaurants and shops to choose from and the property has a lot of activities to offer for everyone. Access to the rest of the strip is convenient with the available tram.
40,Great Place - Great Staff. Nice Beach. Good Food. However stay away from their premier dinning\club - The Foundation Room. They completely screwed everyone on 3/22/22 when the DOUBLE BOOKED the Club!
50,We had a great time! We love the pool and the room was big and the location was great. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only thing we did not like is that we could hear everything from the room next to us. And it wasn’t good!
20,Terribly salted food at multiple restaurants— avoid! Large room with a nice soaking tub which we enjoyed because we brought our own Lysol wipes to clean it. Lazy river was fun but you have to buy a tube or use it without one— no rentals. One jacuzzi that was filled with over 20 children!!! Seems like it would be a great place for children of a certain age in the warmer months but I doubt I would return because of the location on the Strip combined with the poor food quality. I felt like we had to travel far to find decent meals. Room was overlooking the airport- not exactly romantic.
40,Nice hotel not the best location thought this would be ok since the tram that goes north to Excalibur a little surprised to find the tram stops at 11:30pm in Vegas. The Aria tram runs until 4am.If I knew this we would have stayed elsewhere
50,Mandalay Bay has many fine restaurants a nice wave pool and is extremely clean. Bring your walking shoes if going to a conference because it was 1800 steps from guest room to entrance of conference center. No need to use exercise room with all the steps you take.
40,Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino has so much to offer the entire family. The pool area and wave pool was a highlight for our son. We all enjoyed the restaurants and the entertainment and casino at night!
40,Spring break family vacation was a success at Mandalay Bay. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. Everyone from housekeeping to retail to cocktail servers to beach staff.    Our 2-Room Suite was perfect for traveling with our 5 year old daughter and 84 year old mom. Beds and bedding were very comfortable. Room temperature was consistent. Bathrooms nicely stocked. Views for days - although the exterior windows could use a good scrubbing to captures the essence of Vegas even better!    The room could’ve used a little maintenance - arm rests on the lounge chairs in the living area were easily popping off. One sink stopper was stuck closed the other sink was slow to drain. The large shower was lovely however the overhead rain shower head had so much buildup on it that it only rained half way. One of the 2 saves didn’t function whatsoever. Also if you’re going to charge THAT much for a suite and have a coffee maker in the room it would be nice NOT to charge for coffee to brew! And an actual refrigerator that customers can use would be helpful.    Casino floor seems much darker in feel than it used to be back in the day. Table game selection is nice but slot machines need an upgrade as many were quite dated. Not many BIG slot machines and very few love seat style chairs.. still love MGM but Aria and even Bellagio still get my business next time.
40,We stayed at Mandalay for a soccer tournament and stayed a couple extra days for fun. Mandalay is great for families. We love the pool area which has a wave pool lazy river and regular pools. It was packed for March Madness but fun. Service was excellent everywhere. Our best meal was at Kumi the Japanese restaurant. Highly recommend. The Michael Jackson Cirque de Soleil show was also fantastic. The MGM mobile app is the best for check-in digital room key and self parking. The app made everything so easy and no need to wait in any lines.
30,The VIP Package is definitely not worth it and we received terrible service on top of that and was passed around when trying to report the arrival issues. We also received a very inaccurate bill at checkout which we also had to waste time to get someone to resolve. The Concert Venue has small seats with no leg room and very small. The bright spot is that is has a great casino and club (Foundation Room) but is also very small. The food was average and of course pricey and not worth the price. The shopps was a disappointment but actually had better food.
20,I pre paid for a stay well room. Upon arrival they had no stay well rooms. Because I pre paid I had to accept the only room they said they had. They should have given me 50% reduction for not holding a stay well room.
50,Location was great. Taxis readily available all the time. Resort overall was clean along with our suite. Resort stores for shopping were nice! Pools and beach area fun for adults and kids too! Casino was just the right amount of busy!
50,Rooms are very clean. Couldn’t hear the neighbors next door or people in the hallways which provided for great sleep. Housekeeping and front desk staff were exceptional. Loved the shopping and food availability in the hotel.
30,Property was ok. Expected more for the price. Most restaurants were closed after our concert. Smoke smell was overwhelming. The staff seemed rushed whenever you had questions. I expected more from such a highly spoken of casino/ hotel. There were also no courtesies included
30,Paid parking was ridiculous for a classy hotel. The bathroom in our room was disappointing. Probably could’ve used an upgrade. Had to request for room service otherwise it’s every 3 days. The staff was friendly and I liked the Sportsbook
40,Mandalay Bay is a big Vegas Strip experience hotel. It is getting a bit dated. But the casino is lively our room was large clean and comfortable there are many dining options and the resort is a short walk to Allegiant Stadium. The sum total of Mandalay Bay is above average. You can stay at resorts with better rooms brighter casinos and better locations on the strip. But all-in Mandalay Bay should treat you well. I've stayed all over the Strip and when MB offers a good room rate I do not hesitate to stay there.
40,Upon arriving check was a little long but not to bad. Rooms are clean and beds are very comfy! Staff was nice and professional. Everything you need is available on the property. (except for adrenaline seeking activities). However you don't need to leave the hotel.
50,Friendly staff and always welcoming. Service was great in all areas and the pool kept my kids busy for hours. I enjoyed the casino and never had to wait for a server to bring a drink. Had a great time and will book my next trip soon.
10,Strike one- their app doesn't work. Forget using it to open your doors and access to the parking garage as it is unreliable and only works half the time.    Strike two- my room had a lovely view of a wall outside the window. I asked to move and was told no.    Strike three- I opened the fridge to see what they had inside did not touch anything and then closed it. $52 showed up on my account bill for 5 beverages. They reversed the charge but how many people are they screwing over? Nothing was touched and yet it was billing my room. I'm sure this has become a big revenue for them.    Strike four- No more using the spa facilities unless you also book a massage. I wanted some steam not a massage. Too bad.    Strike five- The morning of check out we waited 25 minutes in the hallway with around 35 other guests trying to get an elevator to stop on our floor that wasn't crammed full. They only had three working because they scheduled maintenance on the others. This place has gone down hill. I won't be back.
50,Great place for a convention never had to leave the hotel. It was ideal for all needs for the convention and easily able to get to my room on breaks and to change between events for the convention. I was very impressed with the staff and how friendly they were as well as being very efficient for setting up and removing catering timeliness.
20,Definitely not worth the money expected to be treated like I guess instead of a number very over rated .. not luxurious at all.. we will not come back.. wave pool only waves a little a lot of things closed.. tight gambling
50,I had several special needs and took care of all of them  Wonderful hotel nice pool good restaurants helpful staff  Room was very clean beds were incredibly comfortable didn’t want to get out of bed  Scooter friendly
50,I had a very spacious and clean room with a great view. Lots of food choices from the restaurants located inside the hotel. Lots of friendly staff and very helpful. A variety of slot machines and games. Would recommend staying at the Mandalay Bay to everyone
50,Great service great restaurants really great sports book. I have stayed at Mandalay Bay for the past 10 years during March madness week end. Hope to have the chance to go back the next ten years. Would highly recommend
20,The service was just ok. People didn’t really want to help you. I will say the best part was the check in. You got to do it on your phone zero people interaction. The keys only work for the floor you are staying at. So you can’t go visit other family if on different floor
20,Front desk very helpful and nice. The elevator key card system is awful - almost every time I went to my floor either our party or others couldn't access their floor. This is a persistent issue across MGM properties that is not needed if you'd implement a system like Wynn/Encore to have someone check before entering the elevator banks. Housekeeping also was inconsistent - one full day we had no cleaning despite calling several times and finally the came at 8:45 PM when we were in for the evening. Even when they came they didn't replenish toiletries or towels. This used to be a higher end hotel and the wear and tear and decline in service and amenities is apparent and we would not stay here again.
50,My stay was a great time there are no complaints just a great experience. I would recommend this hotel to friends and family in the future. The game floor was not to small and the restaurant verity was a nice selection.
50,I recommend while planning your trip to Vegas that you include a stay at the Mandalay Bay. My experience was exceptional & welcoming to someone who’s first trip to the “City of Salvation” left a lasting impression.
50,I love this town and the Mandalay Bay is a great launching point to see all the sites. The view from our room was over the top. The restaurant’s casino sports book and pools at Mandalay Bay are all top notch! Can’t wait to get back
40,Just spent the weekend in Las Vegas on a business trip. Would highly recommend staying at the Mandalay Bay. Staff was extremely courteous the casino was well taken care of extremely clean. Overall I had an outstanding time at Mandalay Bay.
30,First of all great initial impression. Check in was easy and the staff helpful at that point. The need for your card to run the elevator was a bit of a pain but meh. Music in lounge is too loud and the stench of smoke from the Casino (icky) but hey... it's Las Vegas. We were there for a convention and did no gambling. The pool (wave pool lazy river etc.) was REALLY fun! That is my highlight during down time. The room was just fine. My lowlight is having to pay $50 fee for touching anything in the room on the mini-bar (in the fridge or on top of the counter). We made two pod coffee's in the a.m. (thinking they would be complementary - as they are EVERYWHERE ELSE) but to our surprise they came with a $50 surcharge for touching them; darn expensive cup of two coffee's!    Buyers... beware!
50,Overall experience was great from check in to check out. My room was large and clean. Housekeeping was great. Several entertainment options within the hotel or walking distance. Looking forward to my next trip. I would recommend this hotel to friends and family.
50,My favorite pet friendly hotel. Staff at check-in and check-out are very friendly and knowledgeable. The housekeeper here do a fabulous job! Casino floor staff are wonderful! The casino slot are clean and not junky.
50,Fantastic stay at a top notch resort. We felt like we were in a tropical resort. Best pool area in Vegas. Highly reccomend this resort as it was well worth every penny. A very spacious resort and nicely lyed out floor plan close to everything. 5 STARS!!!!
20,I was over charged. I set up a time for housekeeping to come and clean up. They did not show up at the right time. So I had to call them back and tell them another time. When they changed towels they did not include wash cloths. Housekeeping did the bare minimum.
10,The elevators were really really slow. My keys had to be reprogrammed THREE times. The public restrooms in the casino were filthy. Not selling day passes in the spa and then making people buy a treatment ($60 minimum) if they wanted to use the spa is ridiculous. ROBBERY!
20,Poor room key card malfunctions unfriendly staff experience. The room was to be a King suite and was very poorly maintained and outdated. Numerous problems using their key elevator system. One key completely did not work. Black Jack pit boss was rude numerous times to entire table. Extremely disappointed.
50,Solid time at Mandalay Bay for a couple guys celebrating a friend and watching some basketball. Pool was nice as well. Daquiri's at the pool could of been stronger. I wish I didn't have to pay for a tube to float down the lazy river as a VIP guest but if that is the most I can complain they must of done something right!
20,keycards and digital key didn't work well. got stuck in elevator several times with no keycard working to simply go to the floor of our room. then the keycadrds or digital key wouldn't work with the door. back and forth from downstairs got frustrating. i couldn't find a parking space for 35 min once. 15 min a different time.
30,The elevator button was broken to our floor. Thought the hotel card key wasn’t working but it was actually the button (found this out later…since we were able to ride up with someone else after going up and down for awhile). We were sent to the wrong room (already occupied by someone else). When I went back to VIP check in they acted like it was our fault on not being able to get to the floor and into the room until they checked the computer and saw they wrote the wrong room number on the key card envelope. In the meantime my wife called and informed me that a guy came out of our room that we couldn’t get into. Told her that we were at the wrong room since they wrote the wrong room number on envelope. What a pain after a long trip and scared my wife when she was standing outside what we thought was our room. Upset that the desk acted like it we didn’t know how to use the key card on the elevator and room door until I showed them the envelope where they had written the wrong room number.
20,Room window was next to some units that ran all day and night. Unable to have a pleasent rest. Tried to make this known to staff however there were not helpful. Ice machine on the 11th floor also did not work
30,Mandalay Bay is just a bit above other hotels on the strip. Not as nice as Wynn or Bellagio better than MGM and Treasure Island. Unless you are being comped for room or meals Mandalay Bay is not worth the extra cost. Drinks and food was also overpriced. Staff was nice and the room was clean.
30,The rooms were nice clean and up to date but there was an issue with hearing people from the other side of the walls. There should have been more insulation added for noise. Also while trying to access the elevator to start our day we ran into a long line. For whatever reason 4 out of 8 elevators were working We had to wait 40 minutes to gain access to an elevator. I tried to use stairs only to find out the door is locked and my room key didn't open it. At this point I realized I have no immediate access to leave. My wife is type 1 diabetic and fortunately we weren't in a dire need to get her access to fluids to elevate her blood sugars. This is a safety matter that needs to be looked at. Not to mention there was no communication from the hotel explaining to the patrons on why they cannot leave.
50,Anniversary 17 yrs enjoyed the stay went for the New Edition Culture Tour the show was amazing.The food very pricey in casino.Took tram to strip it was nice. went to shark reef aquarium it was very nice really enjoyed it a must see
30,Need Key card to access room . The key card] works only 50% of the time on the elevator. You may have to get off the elevator to get on another elevator. The pool closes at 6pm and the wave pool is not heated. Throughout the hotel there are missing elevators button or buttons not lighting up. The room itself is clean but the lights flickers and the phone doesn't work at all.    I would only stay at this hotel just for the pool. Otherwise there are better hotels out there. Some staff are friendly while others are plain rude.
10,Prior to booking my hotel stay I contacted the spa at Mandalay Bay and was advised that the wet area including the steam and sauna was open. My first day at the hotel I went to the spa to use the wet area & relax for an hour or so only to be told that I would have to book an over priced spa service before I could not use the wet area. I wanted the manger to explain why I was told that it was open for use and I was not told that I would have to purchase an over priced spa service first.  Riley was the manager on duty (later I found out they lied to me and Riley was NOT a manger) the desk representative was texting and talking to Riley (the pretend manager) as Riley feels she is too good to visit with customers face to face.    Needless to say I checked out of Mandalay Bay as I will NEVER support a hotel that lies to their customers and I checked into Wynn a much better hotel with professional staff.
50,We stayed here for The Culture Tour 2022 concert with New Edition Charlie Wilson and Jodeci. The staff was very friendly and responsive. We did not have any issues. The room was clean and spacious. Don't move the alcohol in the mini bar - you will be auto charged but the staff adjusted the charges for us. We had drinks we wanted to keep cold hence the reason we moved what was in the fridge. That was the only downside - no refrigerator and no microwave in the room.
50,Stayed at quite a few different hotels during our recent trip! Mandalay Bay was the favorite from the trip the staff is great! Has a shuttle connecting you to other hotels and the staff went above and beyond! The sky fall at Delano is a must see some of the best views of the strip and some great drinks. Overall would recommend to anyone looking for a clean beautiful fun atmosphere!
50,Nice place and well kept. The staff was friendly and appreciative of your business. I was there for a business and everything was right where you needed it to be. Things looked clean and the smoke was not bad.
50,Excellent resort on the Vegas strip with all the best family amenities and really clean and comfortable rooms. Enjoyed the pools lazy river and the dining options. The casino and late evening music dancing were fun!
50,We were pleased that they were able to accommodate us with adjoining rooms and they were clean and roomy. However after booking I started receiving emails to check in early get the MGM App and get digital keys but the process to sign up in the app asked too many private questions I felt were unnecessary to check in early. It should have just needed my confirmation number name and maybe mobile number but it was asking way more than anyone should need to simply check in. It also didn't work I tried checking in early spent too much time trying to do so and it never worked and we ended up waiting in line at the front desk anyway. Since getting the app I have been bombarded with marketing in my email and with notifications on my phone so my account and the app have been deleted.
40,God experience not great. Did not get king size bedroom requested. Rewards program does not travel state to state. We had free play in Detroit but could not use it in Vegas. Room service was not available after 12 midnight Saturday. although the card in the room said it did. We even went down to the restaurant but closed.
50,We had a Stay Well 2 queen room. It was very clean and worth the upgrade. Fabulous view of the strip. Restaurants and pools were great. But this is not a EV hotel as advertised. I stayed here to have valet charge my Tesla I had to valet thru Delano to charge. Level 1 chargers very slow but it worked! Would stay here again.
50,Everyone that works here catered to your every need. The rooms were spotless the staff made sure that whatever you wanted or needed they made it happen for you. The hotel is huge be prepared to do a lot of walking. They had a wide variety of things to do and places to eat and shop. All in all it was a great experience a little expensive but you pay for what you get. PHENOMENAL
40,Would highly recommend Mandalay. We would definitely stay here again. Only complaint is not being able to use the fridge without incurring a daily fee. Everything has a sensor so if you take it out of the fridge you will be charged a daily fee of $50. They did give me a heads up at check-in. I would recommend bringing a good cooler if need be.
30,The staff were not very accommodating when I realized the stay well rooms started on the 51st floor and I am afraid of heights so I requested to be on a lower floor. I was offered a downgrade however no accommodation with the price difference as the stay well rooms were priced at a higher price. I was disappointed with that.
40,Very beautiful hotel. Comfortable rooms comfortable bed. I had the strip view so it was very pretty. A couple of negatives to consider. There is no free inroom coffee. Most hotels (even cheap ones) have some sort of coffee maker in the room. In the big scheme of things not a big deal however when there's no refrigerator or micro (also not in the rooms) to use and the closest coffee is 11 floors and half a world away through the casino it gets your attention. Yes there's a refrigerator but it is filled with hotel mini bar stuff so you can't even bring leftovers to enjoy in your room. There is no microwave to reheat anything either. The pool is awesome but you better know your neighbor because the lounge chairs are touching (i.e. there's no room to walk between them). It's set up to spend your day/night in the casino which I understand is their intent however it is beautiful just keep those things in mind.
40,The Mandalay provides some decent amenities for either with friends or the family. The pool is great live music near the casino floor Foundation Room on the Roof and some good shows to attend!    Also just walk on over to the Luxor without going outside and check out the stores along the way.    Rooms are decent. Beds are nice pillows not so much. Service is great!    Will stay again.
20,Registration asked preference for room and didn’t deliver. Key stopped working. FOB broke in elevator. Hung out in the spa which is always lovely but needs paint touch ups has broken shower handle in first stall and the carpeting in the spa foyer need to be stretched. At one point I heard two workers (maintenance techs) yelling and cussing just on the other side of the spa foyer. It was mind boggling. I assume much of the problem is related to coming out of the Covid down period as hiring Star employees is more difficult than ever but MGM needs to reinvigorate quality control at Mandalay Bay which is beginning to feel like the old Imperial Palace Hotel or business will go elsewhere.
40,Stayed there for 2 nights the check-in was fast and the room was spacious and compfy and has a big bathroom with a tub and a walk in shower. I don't there were hood restaurants at mandalay bay. The only down side that it is at the end of the strip so you have to walk quite a bit or take an uber.
50,This was by far the best hotel we have stayed at. The beach is AMAZING! Shark Reef Aquarium was spectacular and the room was gorgeous and clean. The only thing that was a little annoying was that we were given a room with 2 queen beds instead of the king bed that we booked.
50,The resort is clean and the customer service is impeccable. The casino had a wide variety of slots and plenty of tables to play craps/roulette/Blackjack. I enjoyed my stay at the Mandalay Bay. I will be back.
40,Bellboy took our bag as soon as we got out of the taxi & placed in storage until we could check in. Arrived too early for check in & declined the extra $40 to get our room at that time. They took my cell number & would send a text when the room was ready. Room was available early no problem making our own room keys. Booked the king bed with strip view nice room on the 19th floor. Comfortable bed & spacious room. Did not open fridge since it cost $50 to use or take any of the expensive stocked items. I did bring coffee k cups & styrofoam cups to have our coffee in the room. Large clean property & was able to use the pool one day. The wave pool was not open yet we were there the last day of February to March 2nd & it opened later that week. Plenty of restaurants at the resort but food & drinks were over priced. We purchased a 3 day bus pass to travel the strip & rode the tram too. Only complaint about room we had no wash clothes & asked the cleaning staff for some but never did get any. First night the TV was not working called the desk & the staff was there quick very friendly & took care of it. Just one day when we returned to room to shower there was no water called the desk & was going to be off a few hours. For the expense of the resort fee they should be able to give you a bottle of water & coffee in the room. Overall we liked the resort.
50,This was my first time in Las Vegas and was for a work trip. The property was exceptionally beautiful. The casino was convenient for random play between work and dinners. The restaurant’s on property were delicious. Overall a great experience!
20,Casino dealer are very rude I ended up playing at the aria much better. I usually enjoy talking with the dealers or making conversation while playing but the dealer was nasty with her responses and just asked me if I would like to start playing and not talk wtf
20,In 9 out of 10 elevator rides some poor guest was stranded because the digital key didn’t allow them access to their floor. Once I got a real key I couldn’t get out of the parking lot even though I had prepaid for parking. A mysterious drink was charged on my account which I didn’t notice until after I checked out.
30,The TV NEVER worked  Phone in room never worked  Trash can in room was filthy  One of the bathroom sinks never drained.  Couldn’t even call the front desk because the phone wasn’t working. For $300/night definitely not worth it!
50,Clean hotel friendly staff great dining options convenient tram great on property entertainment (Michael Jackson One) and very nice convention center for my company function. I would stay here again.
50,Amazing room ! Beds were comfy  bathroom was large and loved the separate tub and shower. Pool was beautiful and loved that it was heated. Stayed for 4 nights and enjoyed how quiet and safe it was too. Thanks!
50,Was a business convention and my stay was great. Definitely would like to come back and hopefully it will be much better experience then the last time. The environment was pleasant this surrounding was great.
10,Too many issues to name and staff not accommodating. Was conned with a resort credit to solve problem but breakfast for one was $66! And credit doesn’t cover tip or $14 room service fee they don’t tell you about
50,Great service from Marianna at the front desk. Great hotel and lots of resto to choose from. Easy access to transport. Nice and clear environment. Nice facility. Friendly staff and housekeeping is great in cleaning my room
50,The staff was excellent and service was great. Those digital keys after getting the hang of it were convenient. Not a lot of smoke as other casinos and your night club was fast and sufficient to take orders when it was busy.
10,This place has aged like an avocado. It is so out-of-date with crunchy carpets in the room broken key readers that shock you when you touch them and don’t get me started on the smell! The whole place smells like a Porta-potty! They need to burn it down and start from scratch!
10,Terrible experience at check in. Check in at 3pm and had to beg for a room at 8pm. No apologies. No upgrade. Just we don’t have a room yet. Never had a hotel do that to guests and there were a lot of others in the situation like me.
50,"The Mandalay Bay hotel is one of the cleanest and easiest Hotels on the Strip. Great rooms great restaurants great pool. Always a good time! Even though it's on the end of the strip use of the trams makes it really a 15 minute ""walk"" all the way to Bellagio and Cosmo. It's a quieter casino but still has full amenities and I would argue some of the best restaurants on the Strip."
30,2022-March: We arrived via Lyft at around noon on a Sunday.    Not a fan of the check-in process. We went to the Check-in desk but before we even got into the line a staff greeted us and asked if we are checking in. He said it would be faster if he checks us in using his tablet. So we did. After he checks us in he said that our room # and further instruction will be texted to me and that we should wait in the lobby. While waiting another lady with a tablet asked if I have been checked-in. When she realized that I have and that I had a King-size bed room she said she can get me a room faster if I would change it to a 2-queen size room. I agreed. In 10 minutes my room # was texted to me with a QR code to make my key cards.    Our room was clean except for the ice bucket that was halfway filled with water from previous customer.    Flat screen TV with Hdmi & usb hookups. Limited channels. Mini fridge that is sealed and once you open it you will get charged $50 plus whatever you take what's inside. If you don't take anything inside the fridge you will still get charged for opening the fridge. 2 chairs 1 desk chair 5 lamps full size mirror 2 closets 1 safe 5-pc bathroom (double sink separate shower tub toilet) iron sade magnified mirror.    Bathroom was clean. Typical hotel sized shampoo conditioner body wash soap and lotion were provided. Water pressure was great. Shower head is outdated and could be cleaned better. Bath towels are normal thickness. They provided 4 bath towels 2 hand towels 2 face towels.    On the 1st day they forgot to provide a towel-bath mat. The 3rd day they took all our face towels and did not replace it.    Heating/AC is good.    Beds are comfortable. 4 pillows were provided per bed.    Electrical outlets were provided in the side table between the beds.    There were 8 elevators in the wing we are at so not too much wait when waiting for one.    Pool: Key card is checked in entry. All 14 and above needs to have their own key card. Below 14 yo needs to be accompanied by an adult. Towels are provided in ther entrance. Lifeguards everywhere. Beach pool was cold. It creates 1 wave every few minutes. Lazy river and the 2 other pools were not cold but not as warm either. Hot tub is always always full of people. Floating tunes are NOT provided. You may buy one at the store (inside the pool area) for $32 per tube that is already inflated. Hours of operation changes.  3/13 9am to 5pm  3/14 9am to 6pm  3/15 9am to 6pm    Daily housekeeping was provided.    Parking is $15/day  Resort fee is $39/day  Resort fee tax is about $5/day    Tram to Luxor then to Excalibur is free. It was closed @ 11:30pm.    Hope this review helped you in some way. Have a great vacation!
10,Too much to list but NOT a vegas style casino with Vegas style with terrible service and no vibe. Rude service. Wrong room when checking in. Couldn’t give upgrade after our correct room wasn’t available. Limited gaming tables with limited dealers. Small slot floor. No vegas energy here. Convention center with slots. That is all
10,Below is a copy of the key parts of the e-mail that I sent to the hotel's GM complaining about my awful stay. The GM - who definitely read the e-mail according to the mail receipt - has not bothered to respond. That in and of itself explains why this hotel is so awful.    The room itself was in substandard condition and it frankly looks like it has not been refreshed in the 23 years that the property has been open. And the room was missing many of the amenities that I expect from a hotel of this class. Indeed there were no glasses (or cups) in the bathroom and the only glasses available were the 2 wine glasses near the mini-bar. There was no laundry bag no bathrobe and no plastic liner for the ice bucket. And worse yet the room was not particularly clean and it did not appear that the room had been vacuumed after the last guests. I guess that the hotel worries about COVID when it is convenient (i.e. it saves the hotel money – see below); but not when it isn’t convenient for the hotel (i.e. actually spending time and money on proper housekeeping).    I note that the toiletries provided in the room were all mismatched as well. Indeed the tiny bottle of shampoo was a different brand than the generic squeeze-tube of conditioner which was different yet from the brand of the bar of soap.    The heating and cooling were also inadequate and it was clear to me that the thermostat was inaccurate. I like my room to be around 72 degrees but I had to set the heat to 80 degrees just to get the room up to that temperature. I suspect that this was in part because the hallways were absolutely frigid.    I was also disappointed to see that the hotel doesn’t have a real gym. I did visit the “cardio center” and found that it lacked the equipment that most of the MGM properties in Las Vegas have. I don’t know if I would have been entitled to use the gym at another MGM property and since there was no one working in the cardio center (and nary a staff member to be found in the entire area) there was no one to ask that question.    My biggest complaints however relate to food and beverage and especially to your mini-bar – the only thing in Vegas that is a bigger rip-off than the slot machines! Your hotel is not only engaging in price gouging but you are engaging in unfair and deceptive business practices as well.    There is no easily accessible price list for the minibar items. It took me several minutes first scanning through a website with very poor functionality and eventually by scanning through multiple screens on the television before I found the mini-bar menu and pricing (in type that was so small that I could barely read it). I know that older people like my parents (who do visit Las Vegas with some frequency) would not have been able to find the menu and pricing. Once I did find the pricing I was shocked that you have the audacity to charge $10 + tax and service charge for a can of soda (that probably costs you about $0.40 and sells at a convenience store for about $1.25) and that you charge $20 + service charge for a bottle of water (which sells for about $1.50 at a grocery store and around $2.50 at Las Vegas-area convenience stores). While you are certainly entitled to make a profit there is a difference between normal markup and downright theft. These hidden-priced items long crossed that line into theft.    The situation with the water bottles is perhaps the most troubling. I spend between 75-100 nights a year in hotel rooms and have done so for years so I am pretty familiar with standard practices in the industry. Most hotels provide 1-2 complimentary bottles of water to its guests – especially when the guests are charged a ridiculous “destination fee” “resort fee” “amenity fee” or whatever creative name you come up with this non-optional rip-off fee with nebulous benefits. And with your resort fee at the higher end of the range of fees charged at hotels across the country it would certainly be reasonable to expect that the hotel would provide complimentary bottled water. (And by the way what does this $39 resort fee purportedly cover? If high speed internet is one of the items I’d like a refund because the internet was spotty at best and I had only intermittent internet service.)    Furthermore standard practice in hotels when the bottles of water on display are not complimentary is to have a hang-tag on the bottle with the price. That allows the guest to decide whether or not it is worth the convenience of not having to go to a retail store on the property (or off site) to pay the over-inflated price for the bottle of water. My experience is that while all hotels mark up the price on these bottles of water the markup is generally between 200% and 300% of standard retail pricing – not 1500% as you charge. After reading some of the reviews of the hotel posted on various online forums today I see that many people have fallen victim to the hotel’s scam with these water bottles being utterly shocked to find charges of around $25 per bottle of water that they expected to be free (or in some cases expected to be priced in same range that most hotels charge). My review will be added shortly once I hear your response as – in the interest of fairness – I want to hear your explanation for why you believe it is acceptable to steal from guests in this manner before I do post my review.    In the same vein your charge of $12 for use of the in-room coffee maker is also utterly absurd and outside normal industry standards. Most hotels – from the nicest 5-star accommodations down to the tourist class chain hotels – offer complimentary in-room coffee even in Las Vegas. While some properties charge for additional packages of coffee beyond what is provided in the room (while most will provide you with as many as you request within reason) I have rarely found a property that charges for the first cup. And even in those limited instances where I have seen such charges it is usually no more than $5.    Finally let me share with you my (horrible) experience with room service. My rate included a $50 F&B credit. I used part of the credit for a snack at your Citizens Café and intended to use the remainder towards a room service breakfast.    After searching for your room service menu (which again was not easy to find and once located not easy to navigate) I found that you offered two types of room service: traditional and “to-go” style. I wanted the traditional style as I do not like eating from Styrofoam containers with plastic utensils – especially at those ridiculously inflated prices.    I ordered the “American Breakfast.” After going through the various choices with me (i.e. type of bread preparation of eggs choice of breakfast meat beverage selection) the phone agent asked me about which condiments should be thrown into the bag. This of course caused me to question whether she had mistakenly put down my order as a to-go order rather than for traditional room service. She responded by telling me that the hotel only offers traditional room service for orders over $100 “because of COVID.” My order was “only” about $41 plus any gratuity I chose to leave.    This was offensive to me on so many levels. First and foremost is there anyone out there who is stupid enough to believe that COVID could infect an order differently (or at all) based on the price of the order? Second your room service menu does not indicate that there is any minimum order for the traditional room service; indeed the only difference listed on the menu is that “to-go” style takes about 30 minutes and “traditional” style takes about 50 minutes. Both apparently bear the same ridiculously overinflated $9 service charge on top of the already inflated prices you charge.    When she told me that “to go” style was the only option I had I advised her to cancel the order as I was not going to spend $41 for a fast food breakfast in a bag. While I begrudgingly would have paid that amount for a “real” breakfast served on real dishes with real flatware a cloth napkin real salt and pepper shakers etc. if I wanted “to-go” garbage I could have ordered through UberEats at a fraction of the cost. Needless to say I was not happy. (And of course the remainder of my F&B credit was not used and so I lost that amount of money.)    All in all this was an extremely disappointing experience.
50,Beautiful hotel friendly staff clean rooms - and a bargain to boot! Convenient location for us to take our son to visit University of Nevada Las Vegas. Loved our Strip View room. I was so happy to find a large soaking tub for a relaxing bath after a long day exploring the city.
10,Dirty room and bathroom blood stains on sheets room key continually stopped working on various elevators. Do not recommend staying here. Hair left in tub hair in sinks dirt on floor windows dirty sheets also had grease stains on comforter.
40,Our first time at the MBR - beautiful property ended up with the wrong room but received a discount on our stay. We will be back - it was a short stay & look forward to checking out the entire resort.
50,Two business partners stayed in the two bedroom suite. Had dinner at Kumi. Room service in the AM was delivered at 630 sharp when placed the night before. Room was impeccably clean staff were timely.
30,Went to Vegas for our 32nd wedding Anniversary. Reserved a room at Mandalay Bay with a King Size bed. Got there and we were given a room with two queen beds. No apology no effort to fix problem just stuck with what they had. TV was broken and grabbed a water that ultimately cost $20! Cmon people. I am totally willing to pay extra for convenience but 2000% mark up is even over the top for Vegas
40,Stayed her this weekend with our kids. Fabulous pool area for kids. Wave pool and lazy river. Was heated so nice even when cool out. Only issue was found sexual items in couch so yuck so hope the rest is clean.
40,Fun in and out 2 night stay from Phoenix. Great resort showing its age but still top notch service. Good food options descent table play great sportsbook. Close enough to the hectic stripyet far enough to enjoy quiet time at pool.
40,Another great week of meetings during a big event at the Mandalay Bay convention center. The room and facilities were all as nice as you would expect. While Vegas isn't my favorite place this yearly event is always something to look forward to because the Mandalay Bay is so nice.
30,I booked a king but got 2 queens. I paid for late checkout but it didn’t record in the system so the maid scoured the room and took medicine that wasn't returned and a pair of shoes that were returned. I don’t know if anything was missing! Checkout was at 3 pm. At 2 pm I went to leave the room to go back to my conference for an hour. I wanted to leave my bag in the room but I checked to make sure the keys still worked and NOPE! I would have been locked out so I lugged my bag from the room to the conference center and then back again to the taxi stand! Very frustrating. They reimbursed the fee I paid for the late check out and early check in but that would have been covered by my company since this was a business trip. It was frustrating.
50,Very clean comfortable rooms staff is excellent willing to answer questions and very knowledgeable. Casino was clean not too Smokey and staff seems to enjoy their jobs! That’s rare these days it’s hard to find friendly customer service.  Didn’t have to stay in long lines. Loved that they have coffee makers in the room most casino resorts don’t.    I love that they have converted to virtual check in on your phones and keys on phone less to keep up with.  Resturants are good quality and value.
10,Title says enough. But the prices at this place are horrendous. 6 flags is cheap in comparison. They charge you $12 if you use the the nasty coffee in the room. Nuts. You’d think with how much money the casino makes they could afford to at least be reasonable. But no. They choose to break it off in you as hard as they can. ha! They even charge you a $15-20 ATM fee then have the audacity to ask if you’d like to donate to charity when you cash out. Why don’t you donate you theives!    Advise:  Before booking remind yourself: you can go to an island for a week in a vrbo and even get a rental car for less money.
50,A beautiful hotel casino and I really enjoyed my stay even though my stay was for business. Great location and staff.  Will be back when I get my vacation time to enjoy more available amenities and try different restaurants and experiences!
50,This casino resort is large and busy but very well laid out. The rooms are large and comfortable. Once we figured out how to get around this location was great. A plus in Vegas -- with few places to lounge at most of the hotels -- is the outside pools area. We enjoyed heading outside to relax in comfort in shade or sun as desired.
50,We have not stayed at Mandalay before but would recommend it to others! It’s very nice clean and fun! After missing out a couple of years of getaways we really enjoyed our time at Mandalay. The staff were very nice and helpful
20,I know these properties are aging and given their emmense size they are challenging to operate. Still facts are facts. First very friendly helpful staff checked us in. Can't get in the room 5 minutes later. Find out room has been changed after check in with no notification and no reason/apology/option? Moved from King room to double queen. No tissues. No wash cloths. You can only access the floor you're on and the only ice machine in it is broken. Otherwise clean comfortable (although worn bed with dips) room.
50,Great stay -- always clean and great staff -- a bit noisier with concerts going on at same time conferences in the hotel but overall a pleasant stay. I come every year ...sometimes twice and I always experience excellent service.
50,Casino pools food staff rooms trams the crowd shopping Covid testing sister resorts location are all top notch. Will definitely stay at this property again. Was clean didn’t reek like smoke and didn’t have an overwhelming fake perfume smell. My wife and I were super happy.
30,checked in with mobile check in. keys didn't work. reserved a king got 2 queens. room smelt like Marijuana.    MGM rewards got MUCH worse! A lot more competition now on the strip and MGM doesn't get it.
50,Resort staff and hotel is ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️We had an amazing time. Slept well it s was so quiet. My daughter loved the beach too! Definitely will return to Mandalay Bay! Every staff person was helpful and courteous.
10,Beware… the pool area is only open 10am- 5pm!  Parking is super far away making it very hard to run to the car for something.  Everything for sale at the stores and restaurants (including snacks drinks ect.) are WAY overpriced.  Mini fridge is stocked with expensive drinks that you’ll be charged for if moved making it unable to be used for your own food & drinks. $50 charge to use it for personal items.
50,Had a lovely time with my daughter and son-in-law. Everything was very convenient to access including room key and parking accessible through my mobile app. I will most definitely do this again. I will be recommending Mandalay Bay resort and casino to all my family and friends!
40,Great place to stay in LV. An MGM property. At the end of the strip. Close to Allegiant Stadium. Good wide array of food styles in the restaurants. Always something gong on at the House of Blues. RIRA Irish Pub has the best fish and chips. A quick tram ride gets you from the MB to Excalibur in just a few minutes. Rooms are well kept. Staff is excellent. Very professional. Wave pool and lazy river.
50,Room was great. Breakfast was awesome. We were able to sit by a window that looked out at the pool. Bathrooms are clean casino was clean and pool was clean. This will be a place we will stay again with the kids next time.
30,This trip was disappointing. Outrageous in price had to call twice to break up a party and fight in the hallways got attitude and the noise  Never stopped! The showers had zero water pressure such a  Disappointment for all that money
20,There is no gym available unless you book services at the spa. Most spa services are cancelled. It’s a really smoky lobby and you can smell pot smoke through the room ventilation. The rooms are nicely appointed but there isn’t a mini fridge for waters etc.
30,We’ve stayed here before and had a great experience. However this trip was different. The checkin line was sooo slow and long so I tried to checkin on the app however they had the wrong room listed. I was confirmed in a king room but they listed 2 queen beds instead. So I had to talk to someone in person. Once I got to the front they told me they were sold out of king rooms. They should’ve told me that and I would’ve stayed somewhere else.  Our room was very roomy and clean however there were no hand towels or places to hang hand towels in the bathroom and only 1 wash cloth for a room that holds 4 people.  Then on the 2nd night there was a huge loud party next door and we couldn’t sleep. So we ended up checking out at 1am and found another place. They said they would send security up to quiet them down but they never did.  The pools are amazing here and the rooms are nice if you can get your confirmed room but I’ll stay somewhere else next time.
50,We stayed 4 days with $250 food for free and $150 in free play. It was incredible and proves signing up for rewards pays off. Our strip view was incredible with a clean and comfortable room. Anything we need from housekeeping we got from the housekeeping on our floor cleaning or calling them and they brought it if you don't want them to clean the room. We ate at four different restaurants in Mandalay Bay and they where amazing. French onion soup at LaFleur was the best ever. Sirloin flat noodles at the Chinese restaurant open till 2:00 am was a great late night dining experience super delicious every meal. Sandwiches and flatbread pizza at the sandwich spot was delicious. Waitresses brought free drinks to us on machines was great timing and service awsome. My hubb even got a great massage by staff walking around offering for $2 a minute at $20 for 10 min. is all you need and was wonderful right at the machine. LOL kinda funny to say.
20,We reserved a suite and two additional rooms. When we checked in the person at registration desk tried to give us two handicapped accessible rooms telling us that that’s all that was available when we talked to a Manager two king bed regular rooms miraculously appeared. Very stressful check in!
40,Had a fine stay. The cost of parking is outrageous especially for a guest to pay. Cost to extend stay two extra nights was also very expensive and unfortunate. I definitely feel upcharged and will keep this in mind during my next stay in Vegas
50,This is an exceptional property! There is so much variety when it comes to food and entertainment not to mention the best pools money can buy. It is perfectly located near the airport and an easy first stop if you’re driving in from California. Luxury amenities and at affordable price. Can’t wait to stay there again!
50,I’m only typing here because they’re requesting me to I think the title says all that needs to be said. Friendly staff great cleanliness just wish it were more central shudda wudda cudda… albeit great price for a suite
20,Room and property was nice. Don’t waste your time registering for a digital key and trying to use the app didn’t work right. Just wait in line and have a physical key made. We used the app and it did not unlock parking or room as promised ended up having to call staff in both cases and wait for assistance. Save your time and skip their “technology” and just go to front desk.
30,Ice machine on floor broken since 01-01 per note on machine. Note said call desk for ice. 1 1/2 hours to get ice one night. Second they never showed up. $50 charge per night to use refrigerator. I’ve never heard of such a thing.
40,Good for the high roller and the family; whatever the situation there's a place. If your there for family the single groups having fun or celebrating if you want to escape for down time or if you are looking for a cool place to hang out with friends there is a place for you here. Jeans - tshirt leather or fur sport shoes slippers or stiletto heels or house slippers - it's a place to make your own for the time you are there. We enjoyed it.
40,Enjoyable experience overall. Room was modern spacious and clean. Casino was nice but still don't understand why smoking is allowed. Restaurant selection was very good in the hotel. Had dinner in 2 different locations. Food and service was good.
40,Room was beautiful but there’s a $12 fee for coffee in room also a fee for parking. Parking should either be free or be more reasonable for hotel guests. I loved the room very roomy and kept clean. Need to swipe the room key in elevator to get to floor but some of the swipe pads were not working and the check in personnel doesn’t bother to ask if you’re aware of how the elevators work (room key). Otherwise it would have been perfect!
50,Not really much to say except I was very satisfied with the overall experience. Location room view peaceful in spite of the airport. Close to everything and walking distance to just about any and everything.
50,This hotel is by far the cleanest and most kept up hotel on the strip the rooms are beautiful and very clean the countless amount of restaurants to chose from as well as beautiful pools shops and not to mention the aquarium. the staff is very friendly and accommodating this hotel will be my go to from now on.
30,Very comfortable bed and the pillows were great for someone with neck problems. Not a lot of choice for early breakfast and the food choices are very expensive. Be prepared to do a lot of walking if you'll be at the conference center.
40,My husband and I flew into Henderson Airport had great breakfast at the Landings (if you are a private pilot you may know about it). We were here for Brue Dickenson (Mandalay House of Blues) WOW great artistic show where a brilliant Metal singer pours out his life experience which teaches us a lot about life and musicians. Nice HoB bar for pre-event drink. We visited the Shark Aquarium and that was well worth it! Amazing animals : sting rays sharks jelly fish snakes a kamodo dragon2 crocodiles. Well worth $29.00! The new self checkin on your phone is AMAZING skip all the checkin lines. Room is spacious 2 closets bath and shower desk for working and comfortable bed. Clean classy decor. We had one drink in casino bar and waitresses were very friendly. Nice experience for a couples concert weekend get away!
50,Was a great experience for a first time Vista to this venue overall great experience. Pools where a bit cold but still an awesome pool setting the check in thru the app was an awesome experience made it very easy
50,Love the hotel and offerings. There’s a variety of food options within the hotel and things to do. You don’t have to leave. Large spacious rooms that were very clean. Smooth and speedy check in/out process.
50,Loved every minute of our stay! Room was beautiful! Staff was beyond friendly helpful and accommodating! Will definitely be back!  The Micheal Jackson one show was amazing! The casino was clean and spacious. The hotel had everything we needed and wanted! This was the perfect place for us.
50,Beautiful hotel. I was here on business. The rooms were very nice very clean and staff were great. The amenities are wonderful. Would highly recommend. The pools were great. Loved the restaurants the food was fantastic and there was such a variety of food.
30,"Encountered right away - dirty mirror shortage of towels & shower drain cover that didn't stay attached. Suite sitting couch hard as a rock & no TV in the area. Charged for items not consumed & removed by front desk only to appear on our card after checking out. This was removed a second time after getting home. Simply put just not up to the standards we're use to when staying here.  In fairness on the positive side great bed! Ruby in housekeeping came right away & took care of the mirror & towel issues. And good restaurants available close by. I would encourage you to check out their ""Rewards Program"" and have it explained. Sounds like there are lots of perks available."
30,Room wasn’t as clean as we’ve come to expect from MGM resorts in Vegas. Corners in bathroom were full of all of the debris from other areas. Hair on the sheets…something from a precious guest had been spilled and was in the gap between the glass countertop. Opened the drawer and was also in there.
50,I like staying at mandalay bay. It is one of the nicer hotels. It is not too crowded and you can get on the poker tables and games without too much difficulty. The sports book is nice and again not to crowded. Usually i like the pool but this time I did not go.
30,This hotel is showing wear and tear. It's clearly the hub of this end of Vegas but it's been used and abused. Carpet was pulling up in our room very noticeable as I'm in a wheelchair and that makes rolling around terribly difficult. The towels were paper thin. The in-the-room phone wasn't working. The roll-in-shower was too narrow for me to fit in with my small shower chair. It was almost too small for a standing person too. It just felt very cheap and worn out. The people were super friendly and helpful. Housekeeping people were wonderful and fun. I would have liked to try out the Luxor or possibly a hotel closer to the other end of the strip. Overall I wouldn't stay here again.
10,Room was dirty upon arrival with confetti on the floor. Fridge was locked and broken so it couldn't be opened-even by the staff. I found cigarette ash on my pillowcase one afternoon after housekeeping tidied up. There was significant water damage to the wall and moulding of the bathroom that had been covered up with wallpaper but was bowing. Dirty and poor facilities means I'm not coming back and I don't recommend staying here.
20,Gone are the days of customer appreciation. Can't even park your car for free if you're a guest here....$15 dollars a day. In room amenities such as complimentary coffee microwave or refrigerator? NADA. The name of the game is how much money can they price gouge out their customers. Unless you are lucky enough to have money to burn I advise you to stay elsewhere.
50,Always a pleasure when we stay at Mandalay Bay! Everything was first class from the staff to the casino to the room and the restaurants! Can not wait to come back in the fall! See you soon Mandalay!
10,This was the worst experience arriving and checking into a hotel I’ve ever had. Upon arrival no one greeted us opened the doors or said “welcome”. When we got to the desk at 3pm we were told our room was not ready. Period. No advice as to what to do with our bags no suggestions for lunch or drinks and no idea how long it would take to get a room. After walking around the hotel and casino for an hour looking for a spot for a bite to eat and a drink we finally settled on the casino bar as there wasn’t a single restaurant open. Additionally none of the shops were open. 3 hours later we went to check on our room again and received rude and snarky comments from the receptionist. She too could not offer any advice or suggestions. Should we look for a different hotel? Will we be waiting until midnight? No information… Absolutely the most miserable experience. I wouldn’t even expect this from a low grade motel.
50,This was my third stay at the Mandalay Bay. All three times were wonderful. Very clean establishment. Staff are very friendly. Expensive resort but it is a very fancy place. I will be returning... Hopefully in another 2 years for another conference
40,The resort is nice and the food is really good but expensive. The only thing that really annoyed me were the elevators and getting into the room with their key system. It wasn’t just me it was everyone. Sometimes the elevator key system worked and sometimes it didn’t. Sometimes you had to get off and get on another elevator to get it to work. It was constant. It needs to be changed. Also if you are not coming from an area where smoking in public is common it is an unpleasant surprise.
40,This was our first Mandalay stay. Previously we attended our conference and stayed at another property and shuttled over. I highly recommend staying here. Clean rooms attentive staffing great dining choices. Casino is a little more spendy but that is intentional. While not a non-smoking (Park MGM) it is less smokey than many of the others. If you want cheap go to Excalibur. Elevators are a little wonky with the key cards and digital keys. Will definitely stay here again.
40,First time to Las Vegas and now when I return I will only stay here. Room was beautiful. Staff was amazing helped me get tickets to shows and gave me idea of things to do. Room service late night was fantastic. Loved that we could go to adjoining hotels and the tram was perfect after walking around at night
50,From checking in to leaving Mandalay offers a great experience. The staff are friendly the rooms are spacious clean and comfortable. There are so many options for food and drinks. The casino is beautiful.
50,I really enjoyed my stay here. It was so peaceful and so relaxing. The room we stayed in was beautiful and so clean! I’ll will plan to come again with my husband. We liked how everyone that works there are so kind.
50,Great location and great staff service. The restaurants (Seabreeze and Lupos) were excellent for breakfast or dinner. Bell desk provided great service to store luggage and recommendations of when to come back to get luggage and get to airport
40,Staff all friendly and excellent. Rooms and common areas very clean. My room was very loud. HVAC good. Water pressure good. Dated rooms/bathrooms. The convention area is about a 15 to 20 minute walk. Vegas so no in-room usable fridge and no in-room tea or coffee. Comfortable bed.
40,Nice hotel. There are others more glitzy along the strip but they are further down so you'll need to take the tram and do some walking. Maybe it was just missed but inside my shower was an open bottle os Shampoo Conditioner and a used bar of soap. I just threw it away. A few people I met on the elevator had issues with the room key working on the elevator because you need to tap it on a module to be able to press your floor button. I used the digital key on my iPhone and I wasnt able to press my floor button on the elevator. Had to go back downstairs and get a room key. Which works sometimes
50,This was my 1st time at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas I was here on my birthday weekend. The room was amazing it felt like I was at home very spacious the staff was courteous very efficient quick. The room was extremely clean and I had a wonderful view of the Las Vegas strip.
50,A wonderful visit to Las Vegas. The resort was great along with the food. Friendly staff and great rooms. Plenty of casino game options. Unfortunately wasn’t able to go to a show but will definitely try next time.
10,Was sent here after booking at the Delano. I had a confirmation number and when I went to check in the room was not ready. I waited 3 hours for the text to come that my room was available it never came. I waited back in line and was told they ran out of rooms and I had to go to Mandalay Bay. The room was dirty and missing all the toiletries.
50,Staff was very friendly. Room was nice and comfortable. There was a weird spill under the sink before getting there. But didn’t today any mind to it. Had a great time with my boyfriend. Would come back again
40,We loved that Mandalay had everything you needed. Casino pool shopping large variety of dining options and large rooms. Be aware you need a physical room key to use in the elevator to select your floor the mobile app does NOT work in the elevator. So the quick no-contact check-in was not that simple.
40,The system charged me three times on different days during my stay for items I didn’t use.  During my whole stay( five day) the bed sheet was not changed. I think it should be changed at least one or two times especially if it is not clean.
40,All in all we are happy we stayed here but going forward I will try to stay in another property as I just do not see the value for the money from my stand point. I feel like the overall experience is not superb it's more mediocre at best. Local venues are nice and hotel has a few decent things to offer but I feel like there are better hotels at the strip.
50,Everything was clean and enjoyable. Great food and service at Lupo’s. The room was safe nice and I enjoyed the layout of the room  and the casino was very clean. There was plenty of food places to eat at in the casino.
50,It was great. We had a great time. The room was nice and everyone was great. The place was clean and tidy. The check in was great and easy. The food was good and everyone seems on top of everything.
30,I was given a 100 dollar voucher for food that was charged to my room by the citizens restaurant.  Not cool but other than that the vacation was a success for the most part I did call it in and the representative told me that I would get the refund but that never happened.
50,Awesome environment good food great customer service I love boxing I'll be back again soon. Cozy hotel makes you feel at home did a lot of waxing. Good memories for my 30th birthday weekend was awesome
50,Very clean and a great time had by all. Staff very friendly and helpful. Plenty of choices in restaurants to choose from. Casino is well keep and all machines were working. Everything was perfect. Definitely will return.
50,Very cleaned and organized. I stayed two nights and was surprised to come back to my room and the beds where made and all was cleaned. I thought because of covid that was not been done. I really appreciated that.
50,The Mandalay Bay did not disappoint with its comfy beds speedy room service and incredible amenities. We enjoyed the House of Blues restaurants aquarium and friendly staff all throughout the property. Casino was great too and onsite Starbucks was a big plus!
50,Check in was fast and easy  very friendly counter Representatives rooms are nice and clean very roomy  restaurants and all around service in the bar areas they were awesome very good customer service
50,Stayed at Mandalay Bay because we were in town to see the Metallica show. The hotel was nice clean and spacious. Room was excellent and had no complaints. The signage around the hotel to lead you to Allegiant Stadium was nice because navigating the Bay was a bit overwhelming for a first and short stay. Wish there was a bit more places to eat and open a bit later but it wasn’t too bad. Only complaint is that the spotty phone signal affected the mobile key working on elevator/room door (On a new phone and otherwise great signal) but we were going to get physical cards anyways once we left our things in the room.  P.S early check in was a god send and worth the extra money
50,Our stay at Mandalay Bay was great. Convenient walk to the new Allegiant stadium helpful staff comfortable and clean room with great view of the strip. Very happy with Starbucks and other restaurants at Mandalay Bay.
50,Our room was beautiful and very comfortable. During our stay we had nothing less than excellent service with a special shout out to the amazing check in staff - we checked in at noon! We expected to have to wait until later afternoon to get into our room but we were in the room within minutes. We will be back!
30,WE basically bought rooms at Mandalay Bay because we wanted to be on the strip and we wanted to experience the swimming pool. Everyone says the swimming pool is amazing. The hotel is just so so. I can't say there is anything spectacular about the hotel that sets it apart. The restaurants are just ok nothing blew us away. Actually Saturday night we had tickets to Ka which is in the MGM grand and the restaurant we went to eat there was by far better then anything we had at the Mandalay Bay. On the first day the wave pool was closed because it was still on winter hours (which I get) and the next day it was open but a cold front moved in so we couldn't really enjoy it all that much. What we would have really enjoyed was to sit in a hot tub but they had one tiny hot tub for that huge resort. I mean come on the pool is amazing but I just couldn't believe there was just one hot tub for that whole place. Next time Im definitely going to spend my money elsewhere.
50,Pools are very nice along with a very clean casino and great restaurants. Great views of the strip with perfect location at the end. Love the FREE tram that takes you to the main part of the strip. Overall great experience
50,I recently had the opportunity to return to Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas for the first time since 2019 it felt good to be home Mandalay Bay is an exceptional Casino away from the hustle and bustle close to the airport connected to other properties that offer a variety of experiences and attractions as well as world-class gaming rooms are spacious and clean with great views wonderful pool incredible restaurants and bars and lots of wonderful shops I can't wait for us to return in June
50,Our stay at the Mandalay Bay for the Western Veterinary Conference was a extraordinary visit . My wife and I enjoyed every moment . This was our first time staying at the Mandalay Bay . The Hotel personnel where very professional  knowledgeable  friendly  courteous and their efforts deserve to be placed on center stage . Thank you from my wife and I to your very efficient staff .
50,I had never stayed at Mandalay Bay because it’s not necessarily in the center of the strip it’s rather at the beginning. However I went for a veterinary conference and everything was well organized. The staff was kind polite and helpful. When I gambled in the casino the staff was nice as well. My room was very nice and comfortable. I would definitely come back
50,Highly recommend the foundation room can't beat the view! Micheal Jackson one was a great show! Lupo is their best restaurant for Italian! Wave pool is great! Highly recommend the aquarium and shark reef!!
20,I was shocked that the mini bar was not stocked there was no bottled water in the room whatsoever. However it was really gross when we laid on the bed and saw that pillowcase with stand and another had something gross stuck to it. We ordered in room service dining equality was low the only thing we could eat was a cheesecake. And it was very expensive. More expensive than the Foundation Room for comparable food items.
50,rooms are clean and staffs are friendly. I come here every year for a conference. it is very convenient to stay at the hotel where the conference is held. it is always satisfying with food and environment.
50,We have purchased season tickets the Allegiance Stadium and found it's quite easy to walk over from The Bay property. The people are most easy to work with very helpful bell desk folks and the rooms are clean. Housekeeping quite helpful.
50,If you want the “party” of the Vegas Strip then this casino is a little too far from the excitement. The rooms the staff the casino and the pool are all amazing! If your looking to stay away from cheesy then this is the hotel for you!
50,I traveled alone for work and stayed once again. I always enjoy my time at the Mandalay Bay. A great property with lots to do good staff clean rooms and nice amenities. Can be pricier than some other properties but always works well for my needs.
40,I had the stay well room and we weren't given instructions on how the aromatherapy machine or air purifier works. There was dust build-up on the air purifier. The closet had splashes of liquid that hadn't been wiped down. You can't use the frig for your personal items. Aside from that everything else was nice. They have a tram that goes from mandalay bay -luxor-excalibur or you can walk through to all 3 without having to walk outside. There's two clubs the foundation room and light. Light was better and bigger; the foundation room was a waste and too small. All in all I enjoyed my time and my mom did as well.
40,I always enjoy staying at the Mandalay Bay Resort. Early check in and convention center is conveniently located in the same resort. They also have a good selection of restaurants. I would recommend this place.
10,Subject: Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino    Location: Las Vegas    Title: Simply Horrific -Women Beware!!!    ID#: 830387512    Text: II was on a solo staycation I booked a room Feb 12-14 .On the night of the 13 th I went out of my room to look for something to eat .I was wearing a small long sleeve dress white sneakers- I apparently slipped and got knocked out or was assaulted upon coming to there was an ambulance personnel violently pulling me into the ambulance I was terrified as I had no clue what happened.I told them I was a guest and I was ok (because I had no idea what was happening. No witnesses to help me no security nothing they strapped me down on the germey and proceeded to take me to the next nightmare SPring valley hospital.My review of them is on yelp. The next day after my nightmare hospital stay I took an Uber back to hotel where I went to my room to try and sort stuff out. The hotel has no record of anything - they treated me as if I was a prostitute- I believe they are covering up due to potentially being sued.No security no witnesses.I also believe they are in partnership with hospital to immediately remove me off premises before anyone could witness. Please women if you are alone beware no one is going to help you if anything happens to you.They give no bucks Legal action against them is impossible but I have my records from my horrific hospital stay.I’m a disabled female veteran and this incident has left me completely lost - Women Beware
50,Clean well kept and fully stocked rooms with all the bells and whistles. Staff is friendly informative and always willing to help. Parking is secure plentiful and easily accessible. Check in/out was easy smooth and pleasant. Plenty to keep you busy entertained with lots of shopping and food on the property!
50,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Mandalay Bay. The room the staff the restaurants the pool were great. It’s a little south on the strip however the free monorail and easy Uber pickup made getting around super easy. We’ll return.
50,The property is located at the end or the beginning of the strip depending how you look at it. Pools are great. I have no reason to choose any other property. Like every property wait staff is limited. So drinks take a while but that's my only negative comment.
10,I reserved adjoining king rooms to double rooms. When I got there they dont me they had no adjoining rooms and the best they could do was give me double bed rooms next to each other. I had little kids so this was unacceptable. They moved my family onto 3 different floors. When I got into my new room the carpet was soaking wet and we had holes in the ceiling and water coming out. When my oldest daughter got into her room it had what appeared to be blood on the walls and stains on the sheets. All I got was a good voucher for $150.00
50,Was able to get King Room overlooking pools after checking in early am then went to spa. Rested before leaving out to get 12am flight departure after FRONTIER’s 3 hour flight delay that caused 24 hour layover before we could catch next leg of our journey to ChicagoO’Hare.
40,Great location if you have tickets for events at the arena or a conference at this property. We enjoyed the food at the Border Grill and Citizens. The cardio room has nice equipment but can be busy at peak times so plan accordingly.
30,They need to really improve on the restaurants times that they stay open and also the pool area staying open later than 4 PM and the housekeeping needs to make sure that they stock up all items every day and change the sheets daily other than that it was an all around nice hotel
50,This was our hangover hotel while we waited for our flight. We just wanted a place to relax and enjoy a pool since it was 70 in Feb. This was perfect for a nap and then relax before our red eye flight back to Ohio. I recommend it 💯.
30,We love the location and resort amenities. It doesn’t feel as chaotic as the other casinos down the strip this was our 2nd stay here. That said the app with electronic card was rarely working to let us onto our elevator to our room. Elevators were dirty and the private room hallways smelled terrible and our water pressure and heat was always low in our room.
30,I have been going to the Mandalay for over 15 years now. My most recent visit was disappointing. Staffing levels cleanliness and all around quantity of service has degraded noticeably. Long lineups are frequent. Our room was not cleaned until after 8 PM. Overall we were disappointed in what used to be our favorite hotel in Las Vegas
50,Enjoyed my stay at Mandalay Bay. The resort and room accommodations were very nice. Staff was friendly. Resort is a bit far from center strip but manageable with the tram and good walking shoes. I’d stay here again and would recommend it to others.
10,Where do I start- I went to celebrate my 50th birthday. I reserved a King room. Got there and was told they had a water problem and all they had available was 2 queen. No washcloths At All. Was given hand towels. Housekeeping said they didn’t have any. Just unbelievable. How can you say your a High End Hotel and you have no washcloths. It was so tacky. Bathroom door squeaking noise was LOUD. it was just a bad experience. No mention of the $100 a day incidental charge prior to booking. Not worth the price- many other better options for a fair price.
40,Stayed at Mandalay for the Silk Sonic Concert on Friday 3/4/2022 and was impressed with the speed of check-in cleanliness of the room and the friendly staff who go out of there way to help. Highly recommend Mandalay.
50,Incredible staff. So friendly and provided great service. Beautiful hotel and pool. Great food at all the restaurants. Love the mobile check-in. Will stay here every time we visit Las Vegas. Highly recommend
50,For whatever shortcomings there might be in the hotel the staff more than makes up for it. I’ve been going to the Bay since it has opened. The hotel may look a little tired but other than that everything else is perfect.
30,The bathroom door had huge squeak and no water pressure in shower- towels the opposite of plush. The mini fridge if used for personal items will charge you 50 dollars per time- notice about this is not on the fridge but on tray on counter! This is s gotcha!!  Ordered 40 dollar room service items- bill was 62 dollars!
30,I was really excited about the resort and had high hopes. But the other guests banging on my doors at all hours of the night and the human trafficking van in the parking lot with no license plate and all the seats down with comforters covering them was frightening and upsetting.
50,We thoroughly enjoyed our time together at this resort...it was the full package and we loom forward to staying again... the only mishap we encountered was a slow leak in both the tub/shower but that was it
30,Daily issues with elevator due to card reader not working in elevators. Also multiple charges for minibar without actually taking an item but just looking at what was available. Will be back to Vegas just probably not to this property. Not the greatest experience for a first time in the city.
50,My hotel room was clean and comfortable the food was excellent location is great And the staff are always friendly. I enjoy the casino the sports book and the location to other hotels is great. It is very easy to get from one hotel to another through the use of the tram or walkways.
30,No ice maker on our floor. Elevator keys only allow guests onto there floor. Keys frequently failed and required replacement. Windows we’re dirty. They had to turn water off and didn’t inform guests. Doors are load. Staff slow to respond.we were also promised a credit for the water shut down and never received it.
30,Room lighting was too dim.  No room in the refrigerator for anything other than their over priced items.  Parking fees even if you are a guest.  For the price and the name..I definitely expected a lot more.
40,Loved the hotel. Clean everything was really nice. Did not like the smoking in the casino. Also found it hard to find pool chairs with not all the pools being open. Was very crowded at open pools.
50,The staff was very accommodating. I bought my room one through a third party and they didn’t charge me for parking and so when I went to check in the casino honored it. The room was very clean. Clean enough to not feel uncomfortable with bare feet touching on the carpet like you normally would at hotels
40,We stay at Mandalay Bay when we are attending an event at Allegheny Stadium. The location is excellent. Use the MGM Rewards to book and manage your stay and you’ll be glad you did for the convenience and perks.
20,There was an emergency water shut off. We were told the water would be back on by 5am but it was not back on until closer to 7am. No compensation was offered for this inconvenience. Having no water for hours after returning to the room was extremely inconvenient as we could not wash hands shower or flush the toilet. Hotel staff was unhelpful and rude at times. Normally I'm a very patient and understanding person.. but this was probably the worst hotel I've stayed in Vegas in regards to the hotel staff actually caring about guests. The only pleasant experience I had with hotel personnel at MB was at the MGM Rewards desk at the very beginning of my trip. It was downhill from there.
40,It’s been at least six years since I stayed here. Room was as expected clean and well kept. Mobile check in makes it so much easier to get in and out: the self making room key kiosk was a little challenging to locate. Would have been nice to not have only $25/$50 crap tables on a Thursday night.
50,Beautiful hotel clean casino lots of choices for shops and restaurants. Quickly able to get a cab. The location and view was amazing. My entire party was pleased and we would definitely recommend any other team members from our office to stay here.
10,I have been charged for a snack of a beef jerky and my room didn’t has any of that there was only one package of cashews and one of m&m’s you keep stealing the people and don’t even offer a single cup of water to ur costumers… I’m planning to get back to Las Vegas in one month and guess what I am going to stay away from anything related MGM
50,we got an upgrade and it was fabulous! Great view huge room with seating area ! Bathtub even had a tv built in the mirror. The bed was a little mushy but overall great experience. The prices for things in the mini bar were expensive.
20,"Several weeks ago I booked a stay at the MGM Grand and the rate included a $50/day food and beverage credit. Despite following all of the rules for this package MGM incorrectly overcharged me on three of my five days. They claimed these were just random one-off billing errors and not symptomatic of bigger issues.    Yet after staying at Mandalay Bay this week I had another overcharge on my room again for food and beverage. And once again they explained it away as a ""one-off"" error. But it's not: it's a systematic issue and if I hadn't been reviewing my bill closely I would have easily ended up paying the additional charges.    Be warned: if you book a room rate that includes a food/beverage credit you may have problems with it as MGM seems to have ""issues"" with this. You should check your bill carefully each day."
30,I really enjoyed my stay however I was misinformed about the 50$ credit I had to spend on the resort. Be careful if you opt to spend extra for the room in order to get that credit on the resort. There are a lot of exclusions and they don't tell you about it.
30,We were upgraded to staywell the bed wasn't very comfortable and we didn't sleep well. they tried to charge $9 for a spoon to be brought to our room and they also charge $15/day to self park your car when the other hotels self parking are free
30,The room was nice the price was right and the strip view was definitely worth a few extra dollars. However there were some serious negatives.    The water was turned off for the entire hotel for several hours on Tuesday 3/1. I called guest services and got an apology. Later that same day water started dripping from the light fixture in my bathroom. I called guest services and got an apology and a new room. I had to play elevator roulette since my card key would only let me get off at my floor in some elevators some of the time. (Many other guests had the same problem.) I went to the front desk and got a new card key and another apology. Finally the pool closes at 4 PM presumably to get you back in the hotel and spending money.    Bottom line if you have a problem at Mandalay Bay don't expect anything more than an apology.
50,Everything about this stay was amazing. The room was absolutely beautiful the service was amazing I arrived hours before check in and got right into my room with no questions asked. The staff goes above and beyond to make your stay memorable.
40,If going to Alliegient Stadium for an event this is a great location. Rooms are clean and quiet albeit bring your cooler as fridge is useless for guests. Ri RA Irish Pub up on the Mandalay Shops section is the most affordable and by the way great food.
30,I was expecting a lot more for the price and I was just not impressed. Didnt like the fact that the refrigerator in the room had no room to put any food leftovers because it was full of items for sale. The pillows were not very comfortable either. Could've stayed somewhere alot cheaper!
40,Beer & weed in our trash can (not ours) when we returned to room valet lane was not clear & blocked & valet attendant was so rude security guard creepily asked us if we were interested in champagne.
10,Don’t stay here. Unflushed toilets with pubic hair no help from staff. Phones in room didn’t work and they never provided a rollaway for my child to sleep. I paid 2k for a 2 night stay and I would have had better service and more accommodations at a best western.
40,great value for a nice resort with plenty of food and gambling options but if its your first time to Vegas you may want to stay closer to the center of the strip to visit the other casinos and not be at the far end of the strip. transportation is pretty easy but if I did it again I might stay at one of the more centrally located hotes.
30,Pretty place but seems to be short staffed. Most pools were closed - including the wave pool and lazy river. No mention at all upon booking. We were disappointed. The room was pretty darn filthy and we aren't really that picky. Needed to have people come clean the sinks tub toilet wall switches. I guess the previous occupants had a REALLY good time.
30,The area homeless take baths in the restrooms in the lower level convention halls in the early morning hours- at least I witnessed one...no security in sight.  Also a homeless lady entered the Tradewinds ballroom C D & E and rummaged through the trash during lunch hour while the conventions goers were away for lunch. I was in the room by myself (working as a third-party AV) and witnessed it myself. I watched to make sure she didn't steal anything.  Man the things I have seen at Mandalay Bay would amaze you.  I could write a book.    Now let's talk about the rooms. My room had very weak air conditioning. It never dropped below 74 degrees in the room. This may very well affect your sleep quality.  They use a boiler-type hydro water circulating AC system and what the water temp is in the pipes is pretty much what you'll get. You can't control it.  The thermostats are just dummies on the wall that do not change anything. They are there for show and absolutely useless. Selecting 65 degrees didn't make a difference and my inputs were completely ignored by the system.  I can't stand a warm room. The only saving grace was that at night it got down to 38 degrees so by the law of nature the room cooled a bit but only for a brief time during morning hours.    This Hotel is still 5 X better than its neighbor the Luxor which has major plumbing issues and is in need of a multi-million dollar make-over.  The Mandalay Bay is nearing that phase as well.    Once again the lack of property security is reflected in the activity going on. There is also no security at loading docks. The guard shacks are not manned at all times. At least not when I drove by to unload AV equipment out of my SUV at dock 14 off Frank Sinatra Drive. I imagine their past budget cuts are the outcome of this. Don't blame COVID it was like this before the pandemic too. It has just gotten progressively more apparent.  Other than that it was an OK stay. I was there on business but I would have been more disappointed if I were there as a vacationing guest with the above experience. And to be fair the staff was courteous and the property was very clean.
50,Had a good time. They were nice. So was room. No bad things to say. MGM GOOD CAESAR BAD VERY BAD . lol no seriously though it's worth every dime. Amazing property great gaming and top notch staff.  If you can afford to book here I'd do so over even Bellagio. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. In my personal opinion Bellagio is highly overrated. But that's just me. Mandalay Bay for the win.
10,No running water in our room……the morning of a convention we woke to no water restroom or shower…..no rooms available to be moved to. Told it may last a couple days. Not offered any solutions just attitude.
50,This is a huge property and I loved the location for Allegiant events. Very nice rooms and so comfortable.  Wish there was complimentary coffee and refrigerators for people to use… Most all restaurants were closed after shows got out to get food. Subway was open 24 hrs a good walk away. Thank goodness for them.
50,Staff was amazing super helpful. Casino was so much fun great restaurants inside as well. 10/10 will return for more fun and another great experience! If you're deciding where to stay this is the place for you.
50,I had stayed at Mandelay Bay before but I just rented average room. This time it was an unique experience. I believe this experience has convinced me of the quality of this MGM product. I will recommend Mandelay Bay to all my friends and family .
40,Chose this location because it was walking distance to Allegiant. We were not disappointed. Easy walk (less than five minutes). Booked far enough in advance that the prices were reasonable. Love that we didn't have to worry about parking or rideshare to get to and from concerts.
30,"Comp double king room with no view. It's funny to me that they comp you a room and then put you in the worst room in the entire hotel. The windows are completely blocked and dirty. Looking at the hotel from the outside it's the only floor with big X's over the windows. I asked for a better room and she said ""we are sold out"". Bold face lie. When you drained the bath tub it came out of the shower head. Ew. Casino is still nice but very very tight. Found one waitress that was fabulous and took good care of me others were non existent. Already booked my next trip and sad to say I'm trying a different hotel."
50,We met our son and daughter in law and enjoyed fantastic meals and a great show  Along with a good time on the tables and machines. Shin lim magic show was amazing  We enjoyed a great meal at Strip Steak and the dumpling restaurant at the Aria
40,My stay was wonderful. The room was spacious and clean. My big dissatisfaction is that I was charged extra $100 and I was supposed to get a refund the next day and I still haven’t received my $100 refund.
50,Great place very clean and very convenient location away from the crowd but still; close to everything. Very good for the price.  Casino was great and restaurant around the area were very nice. Would definitely stay again.
50,Great place to stay at. Clean room great atmosphere. Had a really good time. Looking forward to my next visit with my wife. Really love how the casino is spaced out compared to other locations. Feels more comforting.
40,I had an awesome experience at Mandalay Bay. Great room very good restaurants and great shopping.  I traveled with a group and we all were pleased. I actually liked the fact that the hotel wasn't on the strip it made for less congestion.
40,Wonderful experience - comfortable rooms nice personnel. Food was subpar though especially the buffet especially for the price. Very disappointed. Pool area was perfect - had spas & food was reasonable.
50,great time in the casino and the food was great. check in took only 5-10 mins so that was fun. from the airport to the casino is a set rate that you can look at on the wall before you depart the airport baggage claim area for the taxi's.
50,Always a good time at Mandalay Bay!  I really think that rhythm and cuffs should have live music every night! The service there was better before Covid .. the new bar at house of blues is nice and the food is good!
50,Nice hotel. Good customer service. Clean. Plenty of entertainment and dining options on site. Rooms were comfortable.  Only drawback are the outrageous resort fees and the lack of basic complimentary coffee and water in room. Warning if you make coffee it will cost you $12 for one cup and the bottles of water are $20 each. Other than that it's a great place. Will stay there again.
50,One of my favorite hotels in Vegas and I've stayed in most of them. Especially if you're going to a show or Raiders game at the new Allegiant Stadium. This is the only place to stay if that's the case.    Clean friendly so many food options a great casino etc.....no complaints at all. It's simply terrific.
50,Everything was great. Even the weather! The staff were friendly and helpful and it was very clean. In the casino smoking is allowed but I never smelled a smoky smell. I was there with friends who smoked and even though I was with them in the casino as they were smoking the air did not smell stale or smoky.
50,Awesome time as always we enjoy everything in las vegas from slots to resteraunts and scenery the workers are attentive and slot machines need to pay better way to tight but still had fun as always thank u
50,Mandalay Bay was a great place to stay! Staff was great! Food and service was great! We spent three nights there and enjoyed every minute! Housekeeping cleaned room daily.  We will stay here again when we visit Vegas
50,Clean clean clean clean and clean!!!!!!!. Accessible to other nearby casinos. I’m glad and happy I picked Mandalay Bay. I would chose to stay at Mandalay Bay again next family vacation. Staff are good. Room is very neat and organized.
30,The hotel is lovely. The food is overpriced and is horrible. In my five days staying here and hundreds of dollars spent on restaurants in the hotel I had 1 1/2 satisfactory meals. Don’t be like me. Save yourself some money and frustration. Stay here but don’t you dare eat here. Also: the toilet paper sucks. *Shrug*
50,The best of the best. Would never consider another property Gaming wonderful staff fantastic suite like new and the view of the strip unforgettable. All staff very friendly and helpful. Put bosses awesome too.
50,Everyone that worked at Mandalay Bay were friendly and made our stay more pleasant! The food at all the restaurant inside Mandalay Bay that we ate at was delicious. Wish we could have had a little luck on the slots! Super Bowl party was awesome!
50,We had a great time! We stayed in a 2 bedroom panoramic view room. The room was comfortable & clean. Staff was friendly. Loved the food options. Walked over to Alligiant stadium. We visited the shark reef. Loved the tram that connected to the rest of the strip.
50,By far the cleanest hotel I've seen in Las Vegas. Great service at the front desk and the MGM Rewards desk too. The staff seamed knowledgeable friendly and very helpful. Definitely on the top of the MGM Group hotel list in my opinion and even some non MGM Group hotels. Thank you Mandalay Bay R&C for a pleasant experience. See you again soon in April and October.
50,I stayed here for a conference in September and had such a great experience. I came back for Superbowl weekend. The room was clean and very nice. The staff was friendly and helpful. I ate at several of the restaurants and watched the game at The House of Blues which was awesome. The Casino staff was very friendly and I barely left the hotel.
40,The rooms were great especially the bathrooms with the walk in shower and deep bath tubs. Just sorry the coffee was part of the mini bar and you couldn’t use the mini fridge for any personal use. And we could have used a microwave
10,I had a horizon suite room 60-235. I was ignored by management when I brought the serious concern of a 3 piece chandelier above the couch in front of bar is way too low and I hit my head so I seriously considered going to the hospital. I’m only 6 foot tall the 3 piece chandelier is a safety hazard. I like an email on what was done about this matter.
50,Beautiful bright welcoming very well maintained and classy resort. Staff are exceptionally helpful the heated pool was perfect and they had everything we needed in one place. It’s the second time we’ve done a Mom/daughter trip and we’ve enjoyed it immensely both times!
30,Room came with used sheets and wads of hair in the shower. Breakfast came with pieces of white plastic in the pancakes. Check-in crew at the pool were rude and suspicious would not let us just walk around.
50,Carmela and Thi made our stay amzing. Carmela helped us book our stay and super attentive. Thi showed us how to play blackjack and taugh us how to win. We are looking to see them again and cant wait to stay at the Mandalay Bay. Also valet was amazing and friendly too.
50,My wife and I chose Mandalay Bay since it was one of the nicest properties in close proximity to Allegiant stadium where we would see Metallica. We were very happy we chose Mandalay Bay it was definitely an excellent stay.  The restaurants in and around the property give you a great mix of cuisine that suited our tastes very well. The House of Blues is great we had breakfast and lunch there and we also spent attended the Metallica pre-party in their theater/bar venue which was great. The Ri'Ra' irish pub was great we had dinner there as well as the Slice pizza place which was open late.  The hotel was quite full during the latter part of our stay which really didn't affect the quality of our stay much at all.  The casino is great with a very good mix of gaming.  I would definitely reccomend Mandalay Bay if you are attending an event at Allegiant stadium or nearby or if you otherwise want to be on the South end of the Strip or if you will have kids with you and want to enjoy the fantastic pools and beach on the property.  The only complaint I could really have was when we slept late the last couple of days we missed the cleaning service and had to call down to request a room cleaning and fresh towels and on one day they were not able to come back and clean the room. We did call back and had them bring up fresh towels and wash rags. The only other thing was the shower seemed to be Very Hot water only; it did not mix any cold water in to moderate the water temperature coming out of the shower...but at least it was hot water and not cold. Not a huge deal.  I would definitely stay here again.
30,"Stayed here July 2021    PROS:    Friendly staff  Large/spacious room  Easy online check-in    CONS:    Too many add-on fees. I cannot stand a property that nickel and dimes you for every little thing. It feels tacky. The fees I ran across on this stay were:    $50 for adding your own items to the mini bar fridge  $45 per night Resort Fee  $15 per night for parking  $9.99 for each movie rental  $9 for room service    Service- The first time we ever turned on the shower it would not drain. We put in a call to Guest Services and was put on hold for 15 minutes before anyone answered. When we finally talked to someone they said they would send someone as soon as possible. We waited for an hour and a half and no on showed up. We eventually had to leave to make an appointment. I have no idea when they ever showed up.    Another day during this stay the hotel advised us that the water for the entire building needed to be shut off for 7 hours while they made repairs. 7 hours is a long time to be without any water and it did not come with any gesture of apology for the inconvenience. Perhaps a refund of the $45 dollars for the Resort Fee that day would have been nice since a ""Resort"" usually includes running water.    I witnessed the front desk staff break the handle to my luggage when it didn't retract properly. After breaking it they handed it to me without another thought. No compensation.    Considering how eager this property is to charge its guest for any and everything it's disappointing that when their services are subpar it doesn't even cross their minds to give anything back to the customer.    There are way too many other options in Las Vegas. Stay somewhere else."
50,The check in experience was smooth and easy. The woman at the desk was helpful and friendly. The room was wonderful. clean and everything worked well. And being an aviation buff I enjoyed the airport view. And come summer when the pool is open I expect that will be a good experience.
50,My husband and I stayed here last week in the frigid temperature in Vegas. Upon entering the room it was warm and cozy with an amazing view. There are many pools and hot tubs restaurants shopping etc there is a man-made beach which was closed due to the weather. It is close  to McDonald. the liquor stores . Etc. my experience was beyond expectations. I highly recommend this resort which is ten minutes from the airport and it’s not in a congested area. Thank you! Shamena and Jay NY.
50,Room 25-334 Executive King; comp + RF $100FB credit and $60 slot play. Love the floor to ceiling windows with a direct view of the Luxor and looking north at the Strip. Could also see Allegiant Stadium. Bed super comfortable and so were the pillows. Bathroom has two sinks a large soaking tub (no jets) a separate water closet and a closet for clothes. Room was clean. Some electrical outlets are loose thus needing attention.    Fridge not for personal use and a coffee maker; while I didn't mess with the coffee maker I don't think its a k-cup but one that takes the little coffee discs. Couch two chair end table and a desk. Our room was the last one on the right which makes for a long walk back. Never a wait for elevators.    Drink service at the slots was not the best however we are early risers thus do most of our gambling when others are still sleeping. Could use more cheaper eats. Only visited Starbucks for coffee did not dine anywhere on site. Easy walk to the Luxor/Ex Cal/NYNY. Opted out of housekeeping due to our two night stay.    Couple of hiccups which will not deter us from staying here- did e-check in and was able to make physical keys from an I-pad which did not work thus had to go to the desk to get different ones. The digital key may not work in the elevators due to poor cell service however LOVE the digital key for room entry    Highly recommend this property and already have two reservations made for later in the year!!!
50,Great entertainment in hotel. Awesome bands . Location is a bit down the strip but we’ll worth the walk to other attractions. Rooms are well designed and clean . Just a lack of options for late night eats.
20,Mandalay Bay management and staff show an alarming indifference to guest comfort and safety. Upon checking in my family were given keys to two adjoining rooms (as we requested). However one of those rooms was already occupied. We were stunned to see a suitcase and other personal items already in a room that we had access to. When we notified staff they didn't seem bothered by it. They gave us a new room but said they could no longer offer our family adjoining rooms due to the busy weekend.    While the staff said it had changed the security of our room keys we learned that the keys still opened the other room for at least several hours after contacting the front desk (we could unlock the door but we never actually entered the room). While the hotel gave us a small credit it never bothered to check in on us for the rest of the weekend and made no further effort to get our family adjoining rooms as we repeatedly requested. So our family was separated in the hotel. We were left feeling like the hotel could hand out keys to occupied rooms to anyone at any time without much care about how guests felt.    The room we stayed in was also in poor condition. There was garish red duct tape on the windows and missing standard amenities like a trash can.    We have no interest in staying there ever again unless we have to for a conference or other business purpose. I give the hotel 2 stars simply because of its proximity to Allegiant Stadium and restaurant staff who were quite friendly.
40,Mandalay exceeded my expectations. Great room and view. Best location on the strip in my opinion. The pool was nice to relax by for an afternoon. Also the restaurants are amazing. Along with the Aquarium.
50,I have always had amazing service at Mandalay. The very few times there was an issue it was fixed immediately. I cannot complain one bit about this hotel and the incredible service. And the rooms I get are to die for.
10,Will never stay here again! Rude staff!  They were not professional and they we did discrimination!  Check in was very difficult.  They said the reason they gave me hard time because i got the reservation through the third party!    Not acceptable
50,We had an excellent stay at Mandalay Bay. Great service great room and the casino and bars were fun to hang out in. Lupo also is not to be missed for dinner! We didn’t make it to Michael Jackson’s One but I’ve heard it is fantastic and we will make it next time.
50,Beautiful hotel nice pools friendly staff location was slightly off strip whichwas great to get away for a bit there is a tram from mandalay to luxor that we didn't try but will next time! would recommend to friends and family
50,Came up for the Bronco Offroadeo and Mandalay Bay was a great place to stay! Only 30 minutes away from Mt. Potosi and the Bronco Offroadeo with all the amenities we could want. I highly suggest staying here if you plan to come to the Bronco Offroadeo
30,Hotel is fine but no late check out. I am a MGM Gold member but still have to check out at 11 am. You have to wait for a long time at the check in lobby usually 10-15 minutes but overall the service is ok.
10,Stayed there because it was close to the stadium. Room was disgusting and filthy: personal wipes left in bathroom half used amenity bottles no usb plugs working dirty coffee cup left on counter half filled dirty sink Had to call twice once for towels and once for sheets. Delivery of requested items was quick. Check in was fine.
40,This was a very nice hotel by Las Vegas standards and the price was very reasonable.  The rooms were clean and well maintained the staff employed by the hotel were helpful and polite. Most of the third parties in the hotel were also excellent with the exception of House of Blues where the customer service experience was bizarre and negative. That shouldn’t detract from the hotel however which was generally excellent.
40,Location for concert was great early check in was fast and easy. Room wasn't too clean hair in tub and bathroom top sheet wasnt clean. Wish pools would have been open. Staff friendly. Felt safe with key card to get to floor. Don't use the refrigerator you will get charged. This is my only complaint.
20,Upon check in. They did not have the room I had booked months in advance. Oversold those rooms….  Promised the next morning they would have and would move me to the appropriate room.  Next morning came I called and told by front desk clerk basically we can’t move you. Everything sold management said no room changes and basically too bad. I inquired about additional compensation of something she said no we gave you a 100credit for limited food options and essentially hung up on me.  I was able to get a manager and explain. They apologized. Gave an additional food comp. Knocked off difference in room cost. But still. It’s the idea that a customer books a room that should be their room. A 100 or two hundred of hotel credit on food or beverage is child’s play and easy for the hotel to absorb. Essentially one in vegas. I spend half my month living in hotels for the past 17 years! Many on the Las Vegas strip!!!  They have all had their issues. Stuff happens. I get it! But for my first time staying at the ever popular Mandalay Bay. I was extremely disappointed with how this was handled and at this time I can’t really recommend it as my first choice to colleagues friends or family.    P.S. my room was fairly clean. Except for someone else’s pubic hair in bathtub. I left a note for room service with a tip and they serviced the room. Didn’t even touch the hair. Ugh. It’s the little details like visible hair floating around a white tub.    Regards
30,Need coffee in my room in the morning. Other than that everything was great experience my family loved  the staff was great and accommodating. Room was clean did run out of hot water in the morning but just had to wait a bit.
20,The entire stay had issues from check-in to check-out. Self-parking was nightmare and valet was not available. The room was uncomfortable the bed and bath linens scratchy the mattress too soft which aggravated back problems; we had a leaky sink drain that engineering did not properly fix housekeeping completely overlooked our room one day and did a substandard job the second day not replacing towels and leaving dirty glassware behind. Nothing in our room showed us how to benefit from the “Stay Healthy” enhancements; and I never received my folio covering the charges for the stay.
20,At the check out counter it took over 30 minutes to get booked key card quit working on the 2nd day card wouldn't work for parking. Booked 4 months in advance and I wasn't put in a king size bed. I paid a resort fee but they still wanted to charge me to go see the the reef at the resort. NOT that all impressed.
50,This was a mini vacation and the Mandalay Hotel was great the staff members were really polite with a big smile on their face checking in was super easy with the mobile app and the room was spotless thank you
40,Room vents dirty and mattresses are very old need to be replaced experienced a rash from mattress and cough from dirty vents. We did not rested well at all. Televisions are also very outdated. Rooms need these changes to keep going back.
20,Broken room doors and lights. Charge for everything. If you open the fridge charge. The Valet and housekeeping teams were the only good thing they had. There are other places way nicer for the price.
10,Over priced and overrated. Paid over $200 per night and when I asked for wash towels their answer was that they had a shortage of wash towels. Also I was charged $11 for PICKING UP a coffe mug in my room. Literally picking up (not exaggerating not lying) and the customer service was horrible
10,Doors don't close in bathroom no privacy when you can hear your neighbors conversations and they were not talking loud at all front desk staff was not helpful or friendly and overall it's not worth the amount paid.
40,Watch out for event parking disruption - There will be terrible traffic you will be forced to use valet parking and it will take a long time. And they won't warn you. I have never taken 40 minutes to park on check before. Otherwise people were very friendly and it was a safe clean environment.
50,Our posh room on the 58 floor overlooking the strip was a one-of-kind experience for this small-towner. I will certainly return here and hopefully get to see more. The staff was very helpful and kind.
10,Went for our anniversary and anticipated a clean nice room..  .dried urine on floor and someone else's water bottles still in room on the counter set the tone for how clean and detailed the room was- ew
40,Everything in the hotel and casino was great. It when you wake up and need some water in the morning don’t grab the Figi water. $17 a bottle… how should is be that much is you are paying $400ish a night for a room?
10,Bad service I don’t like because no respect my rewards points really I stay all the time in Mandalay Bay but I don’t know if nex time I will because this was a bad experience personal I don’t recommend anyone
40,Great trip. Metallica at allegiant was the highlight - easy access to stadium. Hard to get drinks or food after Allegiant concerts let out. Free tram between Luxor and Excalibur was convenient to get further down but quits at 12am.
50,We've never had a bad experience at Mandalay that's why we always come back.  And that's why we are already planning our next trip back. This time it's our Birthday's and our anniversary. Can't wait just do it.
50,Stayed at Mandalay Bay for a quick weekend in Vegas. We went to the Metallica concert at Allegiant Stadium. The walkway from the hotel was very convenient and easy to use. The front desk staff was amazingly friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The Shops at M'Bay connect to the Luxor. Slice of Vegas as a vegan menu and Diablo's Cantina in the Luxor has great food and the passion fruit 'rita is excellent! I would stay at Mandalay Bay again.
50,We were there for a concert at Allegiant Stadium which is just a short walk. Our room was clean and comfortable and we had an awesome view. Staff was friendly. The check in and out process is quick and easy. The free tram will get you to the Excalibur.
10,I panned a trip with my sons. I reserved a king room and a two-queen room. I checked in after check-in time and my room was not ready. Matthew told me that he would call me when it was ready liked within the hour. I dropped my luggage in my sons’ room and we went to a show. When I returned around 11 pm I explained my situation who said she had to talk to her manager who was behind sitting at a computer. As she explained the situation the manager never once looked up to look at me. After a few minutes Matthew appeared and they asked him. He exclaimed “oh yeah did he call.” To which I replied “no I’m standing here and you never called.” The clerk I was talking with said they had a room and gave me a key card and wrote “30-324” on the folder. Matthew apologized and offered a $75 room credit. I went up to my sons’ room on the 58th floor had to go down to lobby and back up to 30th floor. Turns out there is not a room 324. So I had to drag my luggage back down to check-in. Turns out my room was 30-329. You have a beautiful property. It’s a shame that your staff treated me poorly. Perhaps it was because I was wearing a concert t-shirt as were my sons. I am the President and CEO of a large orthopedic organization and my sons are CPAs. It’s a shame your staff provided such a terrible experience. When I checked out no credit as promised.
40,Resort was amazing and easy access to the stadium. Disappointed in the room kind of dirty. Should be cleaned better. $50.00 a day for use of mini fridge is insane that just if you open it... over all 7 out of 10
30,I booked Mandalay Bay because I bought tickets to a concert. My room was very nice but didn’t have trash bags and some items were missing from the mini bar. The food court is very far away from the elevators and casino. There are restaurants a little closer but they require reservations and they’re the fancy type not reasonable for my little family.
20,"The basic amenity like free coffee and tea to have with the machine to use in the room as well as space in the fridge for personal storage should be included at a resort. Motel 6 and holiday inn atlease have that. Bed was comfortable and the room was clean. $44 Resort fee with having to pay 15 for parking is ridiculous. Parking should be included atleast for guests. Casino Table minimum bets are too high ""25 a hand for blackjack!!"" While the service was good at the noodle Asian restaurant the food was terrible. Had the spring rolls (dry and flavorless) sweet and sour soup tasted thick and burnt also the miso soup was dark and burnt not good flavor. Had problems with room keys access to rooms and elevators more than twice. I don't plan on staying at a so called Las Vegas ""resort"" anytime soon"
30,I wish front desk staff was more friendlier explaining amenities and benefits. Hotel is really good for staying and relaxing.Gym was good and Swimming pools were good as well. I wish if I was offered more information on rewards and casino .
50,Love everything about the room. Room is very spacious and the bathroom was the perfect layout. I really love the lighting throughout the room. Room looks pretty kept up and the view was not bad. I'll be staying here again.
50,Our entire family (plus small children) had a great stay. The shark reef was wonderful the staff was friendly and helpful the rooms were fantastic and clean. It was quiet and we loved our entire stay! We will be back.
40,Really enjoyed my stay there just wished it was more centralized to the strip. Having said that when attending a Raider game this will be my first choice no doubt about it. We attended a volleyball tournament that accommodated the games and many families to stay at which was very convenient.
30,Great location for access to the stadium. The room was great but the resort fee for closed pools and terrible Wi-Fi is offensive. If you stay make sure to get a physical and NOT use the digital key. The digital key works horribly. The room really good. Comfortable bed and perfect bathrooms.
40,When did Vegas become outrageous in terms of room costs? The room was well appointed and clean but PRICEY stay! Everything was over the top. Paid extra for a late check out which turned out to only be one hour extra above the free extended stay check out. Extremely long check in lines. It was nice that they had adequate staffing and provided daily room cleaning
40,Hotel and casino was just average nothing “extra” has to pay for everything ($20 for bottled water that is in room) can’t visit friends on other floors as your keycard only allows you to your floor (understand it’s security but causes issues when it’s legit) but if you have an event at the Allegient Stadium its perfect just an easy 10 min walk. Will prob only stay here again for the convenience of attending an event.
20,Vegas trip for jasmine and working on business ideas. Dirty room no TVs for a period no WiFi long line for under par food with highest prices to far from the strips tram not operating for the hours posted.
50,Only place I ever stay. Don't need to ever go out of casino really. Will always be my place in Vegas.  Wish roulette table did 1dollar chips at night bit overall a great time. Pools are nice n beach is great but beware... sand Will burn your feet wear flip flops.
40,First room service meals are horrible especially for what they charge and had to get 2 sets of new room keys bc the cards stopped working again and again. And one of the covers in the tool has a hole.
40,I am pretty satisfied with the beautiful view I had with the city and they myriad of restaurants I couldn’t even decide what I wanted to eat!! I must add that I was bummed I couldn’t use the fridge unless I payed for it and the wave pool and lazy river were closed. But everything was lovely including staff. (pro tip: order ahead for your starbucks ;) -you’re welcome )
30,The parking garage is once again an expensive fiasco. The machines barely work and the person at the entrance was wasting my time and preventing me from getting a ticket he should be at the exit. The only way it worked was to pay at the sometimes-working kiosks at the exit of the casino. You may get stuck at the exit gate otherwise as many others obviously were. This fifteen dollar a day parking nonsense will prevent me from driving there again. The plastic key card cover fell off our door and was never fixed for three days.
20,Front Desk Manager can’t be bothered to assist you. Does not try to figure out how to help and is unapologetic about her demeanor and attitude. Please retrain your manager they have forgotten customer service.
50,I had an exceptional stay. The hotel was very nice and clean. The staff was super friendly. I had absolutely no issues during my stay. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Vegas. Not to mention the Casino was awesome!
50,Beautiful Property Staff very friendly and Helpful Bell desk/Front Desk assisted us with any help we need/Directions I will stay agaim at this property again close proximity to the Allegiant Stadium/Luxor and Excaliber
50,This was our second stay at Mandalay Bay but won’t be our last.  This trip we took an Executive King Suite - more than worth the few extra dollars. Office table and living room in separate area from bedroom so I could do some paperwork without disturbing my wife’s sleep (big bonus from having to otherwise going to lobby).  Beautiful view from 25th floor of the strip.  Staff all very friendly and helpful. Lots of waitresses in casino area to bring drinks (and actually ended of breaking even - another bonus). Last trip we rented a car but Uber this time (good location to get everywhere for $12-$15) no waiting for rides.
50,Came for a wedding and wanted to stay somewhere nice with an open view and a nice bathtub. Mandalay pretty much nailed it. Also they don’t pump the place with crazy smelling perfume so that was nice. Over all I would stay there again and recommend to friends
30,"The hotel is okay what staff that are on the property are doing the best they can. It's just painful when a billion dollar corporation cannot provide goods and services that a person buys online. Bought a room forced to take something of lesser value. I guess I'm glad I was given something. Also telling guests you'll be put on a quiet floor. Well...don't over promise. I'm sure others have had better experiences. My beef when you start off on the wrong foot it's hard to stay positive. The person checking us in did her best but the words ""the corporation won't allow that"" was spoken often. Just saying a billion dollar corporation can be better do better."
40,MBRC was nice but the details left me a little disappointed. Booked a double queen and received a single king. I was told at check-in the room type was just a preference. TV failed to work on day two however they did send a tech guy to fix it while we were out. The USB port panel in the wall came out of the wall. Just couple of things appeared held together by a thread. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The room was very clean.
20,Stayed here for 3 nights and wish I stayed somewhere else. Not only was it very far from everywhere the hotel/casino had an odd smell at all times. I had issues with hot water in the shower and two of the plug/outlets in the room did not work. I tried contacting the front desk 2x and wasn't able to get through. I will be staying elsewhere next time.
50,Whether business or pleasure great choice of hotels to stay in! The staff is amazing! The rooms are super clean and quiet. The food is incredible. Overall one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at!
40,Thank you for the stay. Great time at this hotel. This is the first time at Mandalay  not the first time in Vegas. The service staff were great and the rooms were clean. Located in a great place of course close to restaurants shopping and more.
50,"Our stay was fantastic. We were treated with respect. Staff was very polite and professional. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an outstanding home away from home. The ""Bay"" just became our Hotel to stay in while in Las Vegas!!"
50,We needed a room prior to flying out very early and used a comped room at Mandalay Bay. The room was very comfortable although a little noisy from 9:30 to 1:00 from the sound of aircraft takeoffs or landings at the nearby airport. The bathroom was perfection with a walk-in shower and garden tub for deep soaking. Another nice feature I've not seen elsewhere is the self-parking garage has lights over each parking space which are illuminated red when occupied and green when available. Very helpful when attempting to locate a spot close to the elevator. We were only there for a few short hours but look forward to trying them again at our next return to Las Vegas!
50,My stay was work related and Ford put us up here at Mandalay Bay for the duration of of training. I was very impressed with the resort as a whole everything we needed was available in house and I cannot imagine a nicer place to stay in Las Vegas
30,i used to stayed there few times before but next time will be in different resorts. casino were under staffs poker room closed and tram was not working restaurants partially open cost me money to ride taxi to go to strip.
40,Staff was friendly and knowledgeable in the resort and the casino. I had a great time in the Poker room! Room could of been cleaner. House keeping forgot to clean and change my linen my third night there.
20,If you have $ go to Wynn Cosmo Aria etc. for better value for same price point being charged at Mandalay Bay.    If you don't have $ go to Excalibur Luxor Trop etc. for lower pricing.    Mandalay Bay is in no-mans land. Marginally better than the low cost places but charging same as the high-end places for a worse experience (food tables rooms staffing locale etc.)
50,"I started staying at Mandalay Bay & Delano in 2018. I can't believe I waited so long to stay here! It's always my first choice when I stay in Vegas. On the rare occasions when I stay somewhere else I come here to the casino and immediately feel ""at home"". Can't wait to come back!"
20,I requested a handicap room when I made my reservation. I checked in via mobile app as requested. I get to the parking structure and all handicap spaces were taken not their fault. Very long walk from parking structure to the hotel. No information when you get in the hotel about where anything is. I finally found the elevators to go up to my room. Try to open the phone app to make the elevator work. No luck. After riding up and down a few times I had to exit the elevator and walk across the casino dragging all my luggage and find the check in to get a plastic room key. Very Frustrating... Paid $200 a night for a beautiful room and they charge you $12 for a cup of coffee in your room. Not room service coffee the coffee every other hotel / motel gives you for free. Apparently they don't rely on repeat business.
20,Night concierge and Convention Center snack bar staff was not courteous. However all of the day staff at the casino/hotel was very helpful polite and courteous. Your cleaning staff did a great job as well. The contrast of staff was very different so it makes it difficult to give an overall rating. It is unfortunate for the staff that works so hard to be great yet the overall rating can't be great :(
30,Toilet smell in room when we arrived. The luggage retreival at the bell station was horrible - it took about 30 minutes and they gave us no indication of the time when we gave our tag to the bell man. On a positive note the room view was amazing.
30,Definitely will not be staying here again. I have never been to a hotel that you have to pay for your in-room coffee. There is just so much lacking in the most basic amenities. Its glistening gold outside but it's a coal mine on the inside
10,I would not stay here again for multiple reasons. The price gouging never stops. Long lines at restaurants room keys that don't work no soap in our rooms and an hour trying to get our bags from the bell desk. Find better options elsewhere.
20,Front desk was being very pushy on trying to upgrade. It was distasteful as she was running numbers trying to confuse us with what that actual per night stay was to upgrade. We had 4 guys and Kim was trying to push us to get a suite with 3 beds and 1 rollaway. Made no sense at all. I wouldn't be staying here again.
40,The Hotel itself was nice just be aware of the resort fees and the parking cost. The coffee in the rooms cost 15.00. Also on our last day there was no water in our tower so no shower until we got home but our flight was just 2 hours. They did take off some of the fees because of the inconvenience. Over all it was okay.
20,We had a smelly room that was not addressed during our stay. We were there for 3 nights and had to suffer through this awful smell in the carpet between our beds. Trash throughout the resort was not picked up regularly. The venues should be open earlier for an event like this one. When you have to be somewhere by 7am - you need to eat by 6am and everything is closed.
50,The staff was friendly and courteous. The view was astounding; along with the magnificence of the Shark reef wedding! The beds were comfy and the room was well stocked with any item u may need! We had a wonderful trip and would definitely return.
30,Hotel was very unprepared for the amount of guests that were attending a volleyball tournament. Multiple people come complaining about wait time for meals. Baggage claim was backed up at least 45 minutes with the staff looking very unorganized.
40,Nice rooms. Staff was visitor friendly and welcoming. Very courteous and my stay was pleasant. Great location!! I was able to visit the strip and my activities were in a great spot. I did other things besides gamble.
50,This hotel is top notch with all the best amenities. It is easy to get to other place on the strip even though it is the first major hotel on the strip. It is very easy to travel to and from the airport.
10,They charge $50 to use the refrigerator ice machine was broken on our floor. Room service never showed up with request for ice. Parking is $15 a day. You figured paying extra for a room compared to other places this types of amenities would be free to guest.
50,Mandalay Bay is an awesome place to stay...very elegant and classy..room was incredible...very surprised at how nice it looks! I am definitely going to stay again...The casino is great and actually smells very good
30,Not sure why one garbage can was cleaned but the other was not. One cleaned glass was replaced but the other used dirty glass was left on the table? No clothes ? Boxed tissue empty but not replaced with a new box? Knowing we have 3 toothbrushes at the sink only gave us 1 set of shampoo conditioner and soap???
50,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Lots of things to do at this hotel. There are a nice selection if restaurants and shops. There are nice bars and lounges to relax at as well. Beautiful grounds and great pool!
50,Clean rooms. Updated rooms. The rooms are a little loud (thinner walls?). Don't have a fridge or microwave so that was an issue. Otherwise we liked our stay at the Mandalay Bay resort. Would recommend for South side of the strip.
50,Easy mobile check in. House keeping on it and great spots to eat. House keeping we’re all the floor to help assist with extra towels. Only negative comment no ice in the ice machines made it difficult to keep our drinks cold.
30,The last couple visits to Mandalay have really started to show the age of the resort. Technology in the elevators for reading room keys is wonky and does not consistently work. Internet and TV service worked sporadically. The phone handset in the room wouldn't charge and only worked the first night of the stay. If you have an event to attend on-site it is convenient but there are better options for the same price.
50,Service was great and when talking to the front desk they where very pleasant  They have so many things to do and places to eat you don’t even need to go anywhere. They would call my room just to make sure I didn’t need anything.
40,For the most part our stay was great 👍🏽 however not sure as to why we couldn’t put our personal items in the refrigerator… seems kind of asinine! Would definitely visit again hopefully a couple things would change.
50,The room was awesome and the price was unbeatable.  I thought the food and beverage prices were high.  Customer service was over the top. Everyone from the lobby to the restaurant to security were very pleasant welcoming professional and efficient.
10,Went there for a long weekend. Beach pool are closed no one told us in advance or when we checked in  Wifi issues off and on. Public bathrooms and trash not stocked or emptied.  No free coffee or tea in rooms 2 out of 3 starbucks open but both have 1 hour wait lines  Very frustrating to pay over $800 for a room and have problems
10,My rate is doubled compared to when I booked my room. Lots of hidden fees . The toilet was flushing by itself and kept making noises. Bellhop and the person in the registry are not very friendly. Next room was way too loud and up very late.
10,When you added parking resort fee taxes etc… we paid $300 per night for a room. Nothing else. Drunk people in elevators. Noisy music in hallway waking kids/ teens up. Security was less than responsive
50,Best service I ever had being in Las Vegas From the valet service check in desk the restaurants and shops. I was there with family and friends for my nieces volleyball tournament that was held at the convention center there.
10,Broken escalator no maid service during a 3-night stay trash pickup at 3 am below my room and a water outage that nobody wanted to explain made a fairly rough time for a nice resort. Also a restaurant I have enjoyed in the resort closed with no signage to say when it would be open again -- turned out to be for an entire week
50,Great service courteous staff. Lupo by Wolfgang Puck is Excellent- we will be back!    The entire staff was friendly- there was National Volleyball tournament that was being played which we where a part of.
20,My phone didn’t work the entire trip because the wire was detached. I asked to switch rooms and they assured me they would have it fixed. Then I called back the next day and they said it won’t be fixed for entire trip.  There was pink lipstick on my daughters comforter indicating it was not very clean and one the the glasses had not been clean. The ice machine was broken on my floor. The cleanliness bothers me the most
50,The Mandalay Bay has the absolute best location F&B Outlets Rooms Consistency and of course Staff. We go every year for Super Bowl and a company conference and we love how it is away from the strip and feels like a true resort. Thanks Mandalay Bay!
50,Best convention room food was excellent staff are friendly very clean hotel. Very good ambiance and safe place to stay. The transportation has an easy and convenient access wherever you wanna go in Vegas.
10,Terrible stay dirty rooms broken lamp broken phone water turned off twice 1 time at 3am after we got back to the room no water we laid down only to have engineering pounding on our door trying to get in at 7am if I hadn't deadbolted the door they would have walked in on us their answer was to comp our room for the night which was only 59.00 that evening.  This was supposed to be a present to my wife for our 5th wedding anniversary and valentines day.  We were not impressed at all
50,Get a room with a strip view. While there we ate at Citizens twice House of Blues Noodles and twice at the Luxor breakfast buffet everything was excellent. It is so nice to be able to walk to Luxor and Excalibur without going outside. Definitely will stay here again!
50,Everything was exceptional. I showed up on Super Bowl weekend and at no point did any of the hard-working staff show fall short of a true five-star experience. While I'll probably make some different choices on my next Vegas trip I'll definitely be staying with Mandalay Bay again.
20,"For over 30 years I stayed exclusively at an MGM property. That ended about 5-6 years ago. When I came to Vegas (1-3+ times a year) I would stay at the Excalibur if I was by myself or at MGM or Mandalay Bay if I was with my Wife. But lately I have been staying at other resorts both on and off the strip.    I will NEVER stay and the Excalibur again. It is filthy the staff could care less about you the staff are rude and after 4 bad experiences I swore ""Never Again.    In all the MGM Rewards Program or rather the MGM resorts themselves have gone noticeably down hill over the last few years. My next stay is already booked and it won't be at an MGM property."
50,The trip was a lot of fun. The hotel was beautiful and had everything we needed. The only downfall  Of the hotel is that it is at the end of the strip so unless you love walking it’s hard to get to other casinos.
20,Not at all satisfied with our stay at Mandalay Bay. The wifi was spotty the water in the shower was warm not hot the sink was slow to drain the doorknobs on the side of the bathroom that opened to the room were not secured and the decor seemed outdated. Mandalay Bay will not be an option the for our next trip to Vegas.
40,Great view. In my room floor 22 room 332.  Some staff went above and beyond but I did run into some grumpy ones. Internet was out the next day so if opens work remote from my room which was a huge disaster for me. Technical difficulties happen. I get it. Just sucked I couldn’t work in my pjs with my view.
30,You likely won't get what you reserved. The hotel won't honor confirmation nor rectify their problem. The hotel charges for EVERYTHING. Parking check crappy in-room coffee check in-room bottle water check. You will be nickel and dimed to death here.
10,Security guards was acting like police officers and the cops was racist. Room the heat stop working I was freezing. They charged my card for a beer I don’t drink.  No microwave fridge was full of drinks you that wasn’t free no space to put anything
20,They charged twice the check out billing.  I came to the front desk and they did not resolve the issue.  They made me walk all the way down stairs with my Luggage to pick up my car at the valet. So the check out is at one side and to pick up your card is down stairs at the opposite side.
50,Fantastic place to watch the superbowl. The room was clean and the staff from top to bottom did a wonderful job. The staff was extremely friendly and our limo driver was amazing as well as our host Rick. I can’t say enough about how pleased I was with my stay.
40,Great staff and clean hotel and casino. The rooms were okay not as fancy as I had expected for the price. The hotel layout was nice just needed more information on all of the stuff they offered. Had no idea there was a rooftop bar until our last day and we left before night. Would have liked to experience that.
10,Not good Mandalay need buy new blankets and fixing that plumbing.is nasty needs have more clean no reason with all that money they charge for rooms is needed be more clean.nice hotel but nasty this is my second time to see something like this in Mandalay bay
50,Mandalay Bay is a beautiful and clean resort that offers anything you could possibly want or need during your stay. The amenities included in the Stay Well rooms put it over the top. This is not my first stay there and definitely won’t be my last!
50,I don't understand all the negative reviews. I consider myself a Vegas connoisseur and Mandalay Bay is one of the best resorts in this town. If you come here during warm weather you will find the beach wave pool and the lazy river to be just as good as any waterpark. The casino is gorgeous staff is always polite I can think of no complaints for this place whatsoever.
50,Love staying here. Hotel is one if the best ones I have stayed at check in is so easy. Very clean and nice service. Totally worth the price. Restaurants are great recommended having dinner at lupo its my favorite.
30,Our original suite had a very loud constant noise coming from the air unit. We were moved to a different suite where we found a McDonald's breakfast sandwich in the bedside drawer that looked like it had been there for a week. There was no signal for the TV housekeeping left a mop in our room one day and never provided new soap (we were there for a week). I added my wife as a guest on the MGM app but apparently that only allows her to get a digital key which was so difficult to get to work that we gave up and got physical keys. We also went to the front desk to add her to the room so she could charge but when she again tried was told she was on the room but didn't have charging abilities. Add all of that to the fact that being on the end of the strip sucks it was not a great experience. The hotel itself is nice and has a good ambiance and that's why I gave it as high a rating as I did.
20,We had no water in our room and could not shower brush our teeth wash our face or anything. We had a very early departure and needed to be fully ready and out of the room for our uber pickup and therefore couldn't report it to the staff or have time to find facilities with water.
10,When I first arrived in Mandalay Bay I had trouble while I was checking in because the lady was trying to tell me that I couldn’t touch anything in the room or I would be charged I thought that was a song so I asked for Friday! Also What she got us ready to head up to our room we got to the elevator and the key wouldn’t work so we had to go back to the desk and then try all over again it was such an inconvenience because this is not a regular hotel this is a very large space so we had to walk quite a distance which I feel like I deserve great accommodation but they failed to do so also once I got up to the room the lock on the door was broken which I took pictures of they had yet to even say anything about that
50,Mandalay Bay is my go to hotel for fun and relaxation in Las Vegas. I have never had a poor experience there and always look forward to returning. I hope that once the COVID issue becomes a thing of the past that the casino will return back to normal … live music every night is what I am hoping for
50,It’s was awesome and fun and we love our room it’s was perfect. For sure we going back. We love our 4days stay in and the pool it was perfect form my kids. It’s perfect for family because there pool is open and our view is perfect.
50,Very clean and nice looking inside casino and rooms are top notch great value and staff is very friendly and helpful with anything you need. The aquarium at shark reef was awesome had a good time going to the virtual drive show.
40,Its a little far being at the end of the strip so not much in walking distance. very hard to get reservation in the restaurants even as a guests.Pools was very crowded and they had the main pool closed which was a bummer. I would of much rater stayed at the NY NY
50,Beautiful hotel the Tram was really a good addition. The pools the casino the Aquarium the people there very helpful beautiful rooms and clean I'll be back for sure!  Security was also on point the staff very reachable and helpful the bars the discos all fun
10,We encountered rude staff a few times it’s like they hate the fact u ask a question! So bothered ur checking in! And just don’t like their job. The room was decent but just with the rude staff alone I wouldn’t stay again.
50,"All staff are eager to assist and make you stay very very comfortable. Our stay was not to gamble but to relax and frequent the lounges and bars. The ""S Lounge"" made us feel very relaxed with the soothing DJ music and awesome PooPoos. Drinks are quite expensive so make sure you have a CC with ample limits."
50,You won't regret the stay. Mgm app to check in  room key was easy and painless. Room was clean and bed was very comfortable. Great variety of games restraunts and bars. Little to no smokey smell and the Spa was fantastic.
50,We had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend to others! The VIP service was fun and the staff was very friendly. Restaurant options are fabulous and the pool looked incredible although we did not have a pool day.
30,Too far from Strip activities-cumbersome guest service kiosk-room coffee/tea part of minibar and outrageously priced. A tram was touted to help with connection to other locations but only operated after 4pm each day and only went 1/4 of a mile.
50,Wonderful clean very comfortable bed! Staff were very friendly and helpful. The only downside is you are at the very end of the strip but other than that it is wonderful place to stay. We will be back!
50,Beautiful and very clean hotel. You don’t even have to leave the hotel there were so many restaurants and coffee shops inside. Will definitely return! The pool was also amazing. Unfortunately I did not bring my swim suit.
30,Hotel overbooked was assigned a room type I had not reserved and had to move rooms on my stay. $50 free to put your own items in the room fridge. Nice rooms if you get the one you reserve. Hotel shows signs of struggling to reopen after covid. Lots of new employees.
30,Nice size room bed was comfortable rate was good. Rooms are a bit dated and could use a good clean - dirty tub with hair in it the whole time shower handle came completely off shower drained slow so there was standing water & toilet kept backing up
40,I did the automatic check in with room key on my mobile. Soon discovered service was out and keys were not working on elevator. Was later confirmed by mobile desk check in. Very upset about this and the mobile desk reprinted our key and apologize but it did not sound genuine.      The room was nice but felt dated no automatic curtains. Bathroom shower door would not fully close. Water spill out    Toilet would have benefited with a fan  No phone in there either    No info on wifi connectivity. I didn’t like there was no security on wifi access. Dangerous. Didn’t even ask for room name or code. Recommended to use vpn if connecting to wifi. We used our phones plenty of data but would like that option    Did not like the separation of mgm rewards location and combination with cashiers cage    Very slow service at mgm rewards
50,They made our weekend memorable. Great service great people great food. The others in our party were impressed by the amenities the facility had offer. You can't go wrong with choosing Mandalay Bay as your resort of choice. Can't wait to come back for our summer vacay!
50,It was overall a good choice for hotel. There was so many things to do in the hotel I couldn’t get to do everything in the short time that I stayed I would recommend this hotel to my family and friends
50,Staff was very accommodating patient understanding and very helpful. Room was very nice and clean. Mlife rewards center could use some extra staffing we stood in line for about 30 minutes but the lady who helped us out was very quick!
40,I was in the older tower and didn’t have a view. The rooms are still decent and the casino was close enough to my event. I won here and at the Luxor where I went to eat the buffet. I would probably come here again the only drawback is that it’s on the end of the Strip.
50,The hotel is beautiful and the staff is awesome! We had an amazing stay and will choose it again next trip. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place to stay that has everything. You won’t have to leave for anything!!!
10,Main pools were closed for maintenance. Not a single word to alert us. This place was booked solely for the pool. they had 1 pool up and running and it was packed! Booked through Costco travel additional fees charged
20,What hotel don't have face towels? We stayed 3 nights never received any face towels. Check in clerk lied stating room was near elevator we were 4 doors from the end of the hall. Last time staying there.
50,Overall a wonderful experience. We've stayed previously at the Delano as well. Every time the stay has been very very pleasant. We will definitely be back again for our next concert athletic event happening in Las Vegas!
10,Mandalay Bay offers their guest absolutely nothing. You check yourself in and the front desk will charge your card for the deposit and resort fees but other than that….your own your own. While checking myself in with no assistance from the staff someone yelled that kiosk is broken. The front desk could have told me that but why would they. They also charged me $12 because they said I moved the coffee cup in my room…I did not move the coffee cup but they said they would not charge me as courtesy… Really? You won’t charge me for some thing I never did Thanks! I felt like a nuisance and not a guest. They also never emailed me a receipt when I checked myself in or out. At this current time I have the deposit fee and resort fee still pending.on my card. They offer their guest absolutely nothing and there are plenty of hotels nearby that might appreciate your business. I will not stay here again and I will recommend others to stay somewhere.
20,Last day in Vegas and it’s been amazing! Mandalay Bay is nice but I’m never gonna stay here again.    Booked my trip back in September and did the VIP arrival experience just cause I wanted to treat myself and my boyfriend. Well when I booked it the package was $250 for ENTIRE STAY! Now they are charging me $125/day because they revamped it in January 2022. I contacted the concierge about it before my arrival and they insisted it’s only $250 for me because of when I booked I was locked in at that cost. Well it’s now up to $500 for the last 4 days. Went to speak to them and they were closed so front desk looked into it and was like yes I see you booked it then but it’s now $125/day. Even showed her the emails I had from Concierge stating that I’ll only be getting charged $125 on check in and $125 on check out. And she’s like that doesn’t matter to me this is what the computer is stating. I’ve enjoyed my time here but the front desk has been rude. They also charged me $25 to get my room keys working again cause for some reason one works for the elevator but not the room and one works for the room but not the elevator
30,You will not find any of the basic room amenities to be complimentary. Not water not coffee not even basic cups for drinking tap water. The property is nice staff was typically not especially most bar tenders. I felt like I was hassling them if I wanted a drink many times.
50,It’s gorgeous... nice place for all family. Good services and clean. Good location and excellent staff. I will be back with all my family . The pool is amazing and room confortable have nice view. I recommend this place.
50,This wasn’t my first or second time staying here and the reason is we love it! The restaurant options are great and there’s so much to do. I also enjoyed the shopping area and easy access to other hotels.
50,Amazing hotelroomsrestaurantseverything!!Book it!!Cleanquite and comfortable!!Very pretty as well!!!!I usually don’t write reviews and am extremely difficult to be satisfied with the hotelsbut this one is amazing!!Someone to tell only this housekeeping to be more quiet tho in the early mornings!!!!
50,Check in was so quick and service was just amazing that she was the nicest and friendliest person everything was wonderful The room was great .great view Beds were great. Sports book was great for football game. The waiter was great nice fast friendly quick.
50,The hotel is beautiful clean rooms comfortable bed great service overall review was wonderful stay. Will definitely stay again and recommend it to anyone. Glad that they have Valet parking and they’re very friendly bell man was very nice
10,You gave my comp room away. Your front desk girl said you don't guarantee I would get the room I booked for? I have never heard of a such a thing nor has that ever happened to me in an MGM property. She told me I would get a call the next day to move me back to the room I booked. Well I am sure you can guess that I never received that phone call. I am highly disappointed and I will never step foot in your hotel to spend my money. You only had $25 tables. You should really cater to all kinds of values. Not sure if you noticed but you had A LOT of empty tables. Had you knocked a couple of those back to $15 or $10 those tables would not have sat empty.
30,Make sure you do not use the mini fridge in the room. Bottle of water was $20 and a can of soda $10. Coffee in the room $12 in the room coffee maker. If you use the fridge in the room they charge you $50. I will never stay there again.
20,We stayed at Mandalay Bay for a Convention. My first time n Vegas and at this hotel. We had a 2 bedroom suite.  We stayed 4 nights. Each night the heat only worked in 1 bedroom. The living area and other bedroom had no heat. We call and reported it each morning.  The repair man replaced the filters and thermostat each day. It never worked! They did finally reduce the room cost for 3 nights after we complained. But the last night we paid the full $437. No heat in February was cold! They should have changed our rooms after the first night.  Very disappointed with their customer service. Our next visit we will not stay here. We will stay at one of the many other casinos.
50,Well maintained. No issues. Everything clean and shiny. Always saw staff working. Smoke in casino was almost non existent. Room to move around. Parking was easy. Location was good. Easy access to other hotels.
50,The staff at Mandalay Bay were very accommodating!! The rooms are spacious and comfortable. I like the Great Entertainment venues that are offered! Super Restaurants Music and Shopping. I especially appreciate the security elevators. Using our room key to teach our floor is great! It’s also fantastic that a pool is open during winter!
30,I stayed a total of 4 days 3 nights. Not one time did they come change our sheets? Provide us with fresh towels or take out the trash. They is Jit provide any basics as such as soap shampoo or conditioner. I had to call and ask them to take out the trash. This was my 40th birthday trip and first time to Vegas and this totally turned me off.
50,My wife and I planned to spend V day in Vegas. After getting off to a rough start with a different hotel we booked here. Mandalay Bay was a breath of fresh air. Beautiful clean comfy room. Made our weekend even better to be so comfortable. Thank you.
40,Had a great stay. Only issue is the shower wasn’t cleaned when we check in and had clumps of hair in it. We called and they sent someone up to have it cleaned. I really liked that it had less of a crowd but did require transportation every time we wanted to go to the heart of the strip. This is a really nice hotel and we will stay here again.
10,Rooms did not have washcloths for hand towels. Closet door wouldn't shut for automatic light stayed on all night. Bathroom door handles locked and couldn't get them open. We put in a personal soda in the refrigerator for a couple of second and were charged for using it. We didn't read the small sign until after.
50,Best value on the strip hotel is beautiful pool is amazing staff is friendly rooms are very clean and the casino was clean.  We enjoy the free bet table there was only one that was open on Sat and Sunday and the min was 50.00 per hand you need a lesser amt and more tables .
50,Was great place to stay!!! Clean and easy to move through. Easy to get down to all the sites. Food was great!! Would stay there again. Great access to and from airport. Bus stop for the strip right in front of the hotel.
30,Wasn’t informed about rewards program or military discount until check out. I love saving money so I definitely won’t be back there. Also one of the machines took my $15 voucher and no one was around to help me recover it.
50,Some friends and I stayed at Mandalay Bay I come to Vegas often. Daisy at the VIP lounge was amazing and really went the extra mile to ensure we would have great stay. Having such a great time as I write this thank you Daisy you really helped make this trip a great experience!
10,We got to are room 22-221 and only to find things from last guest in the room. Called front desk three times and never got room cleaned. We stayed two nights and will never go back again. Never even offered a upgraded room or anything. At end we only got resort fees waved LOL.. Poor service don't go there..
10,Check in was easy but that was the best part. Though the room looked new there were problems with it. First- the tub was dirty. It had hair in it and the spot between the shower and tub didn't look like it had ever been cleaned.  Luckily we had dual sinks because one of them was broken. Our phone did not work so I couldn't call to report it. I saw a staff member on our floor and reported it to him but nothing was done. You would think that housekeeping would have noticed that the sink was broken but it still wasn't fixed. I was there for 4 days and nothing was done. As I was there for business and had meetings to attend I wasn't about to track another person down to report the problem.  Also- While I was trying to rest someone came into my room. It was not housekeeping as they already had come by to change the towels. It was very disturbing as they did not make themselves known when they opened the door nor did they knock. I am not the only person to experience this either. two of my colleagues also had unannounced strangers enter their rooms.  It was very disappointing that this premiere hotel would fall so far from the bar they had set for themselves. If you can avoid it- stay somewhere else.
20,Checked us in to already occupied room after telling us they didn’t have any strip views (I’m platinum & supposed to get upgrades) then after they screwed up all the sudden now there is view room . Ok. Get to the room  furniture worn missing towels & toiletries. Called housekeeping after holding for 20 mins - hung up.
50,Hotel and Casino were awesome. My family and i traveled there to go to the Pro Bowl. The Hotel is walking distance to Allegiant stadium. Convince and quality were awesome commodities for our tripMandalay Bay was all of the above.
50,I prefer this hotel over the other places in Vegas. My kids attended a concert at one of their venues and knew they would be safe. We plan to stay again in a couple of weeks for another concert. The hotel and casino are very clean compared to other place we have stayed.
50,Check in was not crowded and easy. Casino was big and lots of game choices. Our room was big and very clean. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom was a little small and had only one sink. Views were amazing (57th floor facing north).
40,Our stay was good. Room was as clean as can be expected for a VERY picky traveler. Was it perfect.... NO (not sure there is such a thing) did I feel comfortable enough to sleep there.... YES. Small inconveniences like any Vegas hotel we couldn't put our own beverages in the fridge because it was stocked with their expensive beverages. Not enough washcloths and hand towels for us as we both wash our faces morning and night and don't like to use hand towels over and over (so finicky). It was no problem as Housekeeping brought extra's right up.
20,To far from strip the beach pool was closed a lot of people where having trouble with keycards for the elevator and parking staff was not very nice I personally wouldn’t book here again nor would I recommend to friends and family way nicer hotels in Vegas for this price.
50,Great staff and excellent location. Food options are exceptional! An easy walk or tram ride to all of the MGM properties and the sports book is awesome. Shopping is very good and the pool area is huge with a lazy river.
40,Our family had a great stay at Mandalay Bay. We only wish we had some warmer weather to enjoy the pool next time I guess. The guest rooms were beautiful and a great view of Allegiant Stadium which we walked to for the Pro Bowl super convenient!
50,Clean great beds staff goes out of their way to help you in every department. There are always staff around. Restaurants take out and fast food are great. A welcoming environment. Great place if you’re going to a football game. I wish they had $5 tables.
50,Our stay was very nice and comfortable. The room was nicely decorated and spacious. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom large! The rest of the property was nicely keep up and we enjoyed the restaurants.
20,Was told from pit boss resort fee would be waived only to find out at checkout by mlife rep that fee would not be waived. No explanation was given only that I couldn't receive it because I'm not gold member.
50,One of the best hotels in vegas room was very clean easy check in and easy check out . Staff was very friendly. The bartender was awesome and created a special drink for me because I’m diabetic that didn’t have a lot of sugar.
40,Staff was friendly and helpful. Cardio room needs some attention. I liked the atmosphere there. We went in February so didn’t use the pool. We went to three restaurants food was good. Our least favorite was the House of Blues. Lukewarm food and service. The best was the Noodle House.
30,Perhaps because of Covid but some things were lacking. Overall the room was clean and spacious. The robes and slippers were missing form the room there is no complimentary coffee in the room. The beach pool was closed 1 jacuzzi was closed for maintenance (no signs just word of mouth from the life guards). There was heavy machine equipment in the walkways in the pool area that you had to walk around (not the best safety practices). Pool is only open from 9am-4pm and checkout is at 11am.
10,If you are looking for a friendly casino….DO NOT stay here!! Room was ok everything is extremely expensive ($20 for a bottle water in the room) it’s far from most on the strip and the dealers were shockingly unprofessional and unfriendly! We stayed there but after we figured the place out we spent most our time and money elsewhere. As many times as we have been to Vegas I have never experienced anything like this….we will not be back to Mandalay Bay!
10,We reserved a king bed room and are Platinum rewards members. When we checked in at the front desk we asked for an upgrade (because of Platinum status) but the front desk clerk said we are not eligible for an upgrade. When we got to the room we discovered two queen beds (not what we had reserved). We were too tired to go back down to the lobby and ask for what we reserved and paid for (it was midnight). That night we could night sleep because the heater in the room did not work. Made a loud noise all night. Very disappointing experience as we stay at MGM resorts several times a year and are usually very satisfied.
50,Would definitely go back to the Mandalay Bay their staff service was exceptional. Restaurant and casino were also great. Just let people storage stuff on the fridges without paying a fee and guests will thank you all!
40,I like the cleanliness availability of facial mask security and presence of card to access to your room. The restaurant set up is also convenient for me .By the wat I'm a handicapped and the only thing a notice is small shower room
50,We enjoyed this location for the Pro Bowl event which is next door to Allegiant Stadium; the amenities are great and the location is easily assessable for other areas away from the Strip.I recommend the usage of this hotel and it also has great restaurants.
30,there is a need for carpet upgrade and remodeling. took a long time to the operator on the phone t have the remote control replaced. over all the stay was fine. bed was comfortable. rooms are spacious
50,An overall Excellent experience. The only downfall throughout the entire trip was something out of the control of the hotel directly. The Mask Mandate for the hotel / convention hall seemed to be a somewhat fruitless measure. It would have been much more enjoyable overall for the Hotel to allow a Customer Discretion Mandate in my opinion. Other than that it was an overall very good experience.
50,The hotel was very nice and clean as usual. It is getting a bit outdated as we haqve been staying here for over 20 years. But we still enjoy our experience here. When we checked in the lady was not the frienliest which started our trip off rough. But we enjoyed everything else and had very friendly dealers and pit bosses.
40,It was a good stay over all. Ice machine on my floor broken. House keeping was friendly. It’s far from strip but the tram train will get you there. It has limited operating times. I loved my view. I played at the casino. Everyone is friendly and helpful. Don’t touch items if you don’t want to be charged.
30,All the staff there was really nice and helpful and really went above and beyond. The room looks nice but the walls were so thin. I could hear everything next door as if we were in the same room and that alone would not make me stay there in the future.
50,Had a great time in Vegas especially at Mandalay Bay! Service was great! Rooms very nice! Beds super comfortable! Seeing the Michael Jackson One show best show ever! Thank you to Mandalay Bay Cirque du Soleil and Vegas for making this a fun and great trip experience. It was something we really needed
50,Our business will be going to the Surface Show very often so we love that everything is offered at the Resort. Having food options available during the nighttime is preferred even if it's a light snack.
50,We come every year in Januaryand enjoy this location on the strip. Rooms and amenities are always top notch. Everyone we encountered from front desk to maid service was extremely helpful and friendly. Next trip is already planned.
50,Everything was great as usual with Mandalay Bay staff nice friendly and approachable.. you need to power wash garage parking area very sticky. Other than that this is my go to.that’s all I have…………..
50,Great Experience From the airport no issues very easy arriving at the hotel easy check in from my phone I had to get a physical key the next day because virtual key stopped working. Great food Great live bands
40,"I stayed at the Mandalay Bay for a conference that was being held at their convention center. The hotel room was excellent very spacious and clean nice layout beautiful amenities. Most importantly for me the room was very quiet. The restaurants in the complex are a good variety and the ones I tried had excellent quality of food. The convention center was convenient and had good amenities. My only negative is the location on the Strip is a bit removed from the other attractions on the Strip so it's a decent walk to see the other sights of Las Vegas. Since it was pretty cool when I visited in Feb I did not use the pool. It looked like the ""beach"" was closed up for the winter season. A significant number of customers staying at the resort were not wearing masks during this COVID19 pandemic though all the hotel staff I saw were compliant with wearing masks. The staff at the convention center were good about reminding attendees to wear masks though not so much in other areas of the resort (ie casino or lobby)."
50,Fun getaway and smooth hotel service. Was able to get breakfast at the downstairs Cafe. Excellent ham and cheese bagel with coffee then off to place sports bet. The sports bets were very easy and the craps tables is why I'll be returning.
50,The hotel was extremely clean and organized. Rooms were large and roomy bathrooms were perfect complete with bathtub separate shower and private toilet. Lots of extra storage room(2 closets) and a TV with great channels.
50,It had been a couple of CoVid years since we have been to Mandalay. It was a fun relaxing time. Room was clean and we were well taken care of. Restaurants also provided good food and service. Spa services were great as always. Only bad is they got rid of a bunch of our favourite slots in the casino.
50,Great help from the people in the lobby and the MetLife people. Rooms were always clean. Thought the food services were very convenient. The gambling tables were a bit expensive. Loved the service in the sports book.
50,So much fun in Vegas Mandalay Resort was great!! Good food at Kumis sushi  great drinks  fun gambling on the Casino floor. Definitely a great place to stay. The pool was a bit packed for January but still a fabulous day swimming 🏊‍♀️
10,Room had no toilet paper toiletries or washcloths. Had to shower with the only hand towel provided. Plastic bag was still covering the smoke detector from previous guest. Staff only offered to send up toiletries and paper products rather than switch rooms. Cleaning was definitely a concern as there was hair in the bathtub as well yet no reaction from Front desk.
40,Came for the pro bowl. I hadn't been to Las Vegas in a while and was pleased to see there was a walkway from the Mandalay Bay Hotel to Allegiant Stadium. Hotel marketing made it seem like it was an elevated dedicated walkway with food trucks and outdoor bars etc. It isn't. The city closes off the Frank Sinatra overpass and you are directed to walk over the bridge to the stadium. Thankfully it was a nice day and the walk only took around 7-10 minutes. There were no food trucks out side. Nothing. It could have been because it was the pro bowl and not a regular Raiders game. But it felt a little bait and switch-y. Not a lot of shopping options. Long walk to the Shark Experience. Food was hit or miss. Ate dinner at the Michael Mina's Strip Steak and the meal had NO flavor. I had a bowl of chicken soup at Citizens and it was amazing. enjoyed Mexican food at Hussong's in the Mandalay Place shoppes. The lobby bar had an interesting mix of local bands and was enjoyable. Della's in Delano had an interesting breakfast mix. Great hashbrowns. Liked how central it was from the lobby to my room. Very easy access. And Hazel's was a delight. Great staff!
50,Room was exceptionally nice and all the staff were friendly and very helpful. Beautiful views and dinner in the Foundation Room was excellent. Servers were attentive and pleasant even though we were bummed about the concert having to be cancelled due to Covid.
50,We come to Surfaces a flooring convention every year and this is the place to stay. We enjoy how close it is to the conference and all the staff are friendly and inviting. We enjoy are room and the full view of the strip. We are looking forward to next year.
30,Our stay was pretty good. We loved being able to walk from the hotel to Allegiant Stadium and we also loved the casino. Our room however was not as clean as it should have been especially during a pandemic.
50,The whole experience was amazing the service was 100% the rooms were clean the staff was friendly check in and out was quick then I expected coming back on my next trip with family and friends and recommending it to others
30,Each year this venue hosts a trade show I am excited to attend in an industry I love however the property is usually the biggest disappointment. Very few changes over the last 15 years average service and entertainment.
10,I was moved to three different rooms. In all three bathrooms of the rooms there were spots of black mold. One of the bathrooms the shower drain was completely loose. In one of the rooms there was garbage left on dresser and it smelled like smoke.
50,Great hotel especially for attending an event at the convention center connected to hotel. Restaurants are all very good and easy to book reservation. Not hard to navigate around casino. Rooms very nice and quiet.
10,Probably would never stay here again unfortunatley mandalay used to be one of my favorites. Hopefully they fix these issues this hotel needs to step It up and really go above and beyond considering they are so far from everything.
50,Stayed on a Thursday night. Room was very clean and stocked with appropriate number of towels for guests. Ease to check in and out with app. The app also made it easier to pay for self parking. Have stayed several times and never been disappointed.
40,Overall the property has everything that you’d expect from a resort hotel. The rooms are comfortable the amenities are satisfactory and the gaming options are similar to other casinos along the strip.
50,January 28 2022 meeting with friends from Colorado and Alaska was awesome. Some of my friends have never been to Vegas; they enjoyed the stay. The 24 hours room service would be great. The bar won't take my $75.00 credit for my birthday sad.
40,I generally had a great time in Mandalay Bay Hotel despite of its being older than other hotels nearby.  The best benefit was Self-parking fee of $15 / day with unlimited privilege and I was able to park free at any one of the thirteen hotels under the MGM Resort family hotels.  The worst part MGM extreme stingy treatments on their frigs. I felt like I was in Motel6 with their policy governing the frig. They should REMOVE the frig from ALL rooms.
50,I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the room. The hotel has a great variety of restaurants and shows. No need to leave Mandalay Bay at all. I plenty of places to enjoy your favorite daily activities
50,All you need at one location and close by. Everyone is friendly and helpful. Great free entertainment (musical talent while around the casino). Beach area is amazing for adults and children. A great escape.
50,This property is beautiful & staff is friendly. The only downside of the room is that you cannot utilize the mini fridge because it is a censored bar inside. There is a tram service to other hotels and it is connected to the Delano.
10,I booked a nice room for higher price. Next door neighbors were very loud until 7am. Called security twice it was not recorded. Next day asked to switch rooms. I got a cheaper room but for the price of more expensive one. I was given a key to enter my room so pack when moving to another. The key did not work again waited for security for 30 min to come up and open the door. Worst experience.
50,Mandalay Bay has everything one could want; fine hotel great restaurants entertainment in the House of Blues shopping and gambling galore. Great staff plenty of options and tremendous value. Can't get much better.
10,I paid for a king bed instead I got a room with 2 beds not just that but they gave me a room that I could hear the neighbors because we were separated by just a door! I got charged during check in 200$ in fees then during check out another $88 in more fees. Weird noises in the restroom aswell
40,We had a great stay at Mandalay Bay. We had 2 rooms reserved and asked for king beds and if possible adjoining rooms! We did not get the king beds because we checked in late… 6pm and was told it’s first come first serve which I was somewhat perturbed about. We were given handicap rooms ( walk in shower and seats in the tub). The rooms were nice  very clean and plenty big. The other thing that’s our perturbs us was the fridge was completely filled with drinks to purchase and the sign said do not place any personal drinks in this fridge.. you will be charged if you do! Seriously.. I can’t put my bottle of water in their fridge ! Sorta cheap I’d say!
50,From check-in to check-out everything was perfect a must stay if your headed to Las Vegas! I've stayed at many resorts on the strip but I guess I was saving this gem for last. Can't wait to go back a true treasure in Las Vegas!
20,I stayed at this property for several days for a work conference. The staff was friendly and the check-in experience went smoothly. Unfortunately overall the experience was negative. The shower had several areas of mildew and there were long hairs and dust bunnies throughout the room and bathroom. Myself and two of my female companions also all had hotel employees walk into our rooms unannounced. I was very disturbed when this happened to me as I was in the bathtub. I would not recommend this hotel - not worth the price at all in my opinion.
20,I had a special night planned for my girl and I. I bought a ring and was gonna propose to my girlfriend. We got ready and were headed to our reservations but when I went to retrieve the ring the safe malfunctioned! We called for a technician but it was an hour wait! We missed our reservations and the night was ruined!
10,I called concierge informing them that I am allergic to almonds and that the soap and shampoo in my room has almond in them. I was put on hold and then informed that they are unable to reach anyone in house keeping but that they would keep trying and they would send someone up to remove the soap and shampoo from my room. I told them that it wasn't a hurry as long as it's sealed its not a problem but I'd like it gone and let them know I'd be stepping out.    All weekend I saw those bottles sitting in my room. No one ever tried to get in touch with me to resolve the issue and had I not brought my own soap and shampoo I would not have had any hand soap body soap or shampoo.    As well the shower had mildew in it.
50,So the weekend we decided to stay in vegas was a boxing NHL all stars and Pro bowl weekend. Wow can we pick'em. But the staff at Mandalay Bay were excellent. We are not high rollers yet we were treated with respect and courtesy as though we were. Never undermining our sense of budget. Everyone was helpful and I look forward to going back to this great resort.
10,Get ready for rip off with overpriced hotel rates for worn dated hotel rooms and exorbitant prices for basics like in room coffee $12 and $10 20 bottles of water in room. Resort fees on the top when not even used or weather permitted. In room phone did not work and no external call to hotel answered with a real person.
50,I earned a free night and I was so pleased with the room and staff friendliness. The mobile check in saved me so much time! I will most definitely be staying again in the future. Thank you so much for making my family vegas trip so much better.
40,I was disappointed about the pool hours and lack of awareness on timing I would have liked to have a little more input on where by room was so I could control my view a bit more the room phone was broken and the safe was locked.    Staff was top notch especially the Bell staff valets and concierge
40,I had the most amazing massage at the Mandalay spa. His name was Noop. Extremely experienced. Terrific sports semi deep tissue massage. Great at stretching and removing muscle knots. I cannot say enough positive things about his treatments.
30,Going to start staying and playing at Caesars y’all don’t care about the guest just their pockets. Never again sorry. Bad for the guest. I was a pearl before you changed the Mlife and I had to pay for parking.
10,Staff is more concerned with Nickle and Diming customers (costs to open your refrigerator $20) than Customer Service. Customer Service is not a priority for them. Cost $20 to use Gym Cost $30 for Pool. Rude.
50,Everything was wonderful from contactless check in to every interaction with staff. Was able to get room with a view even though it was a comp room. Will definitely be back soon.    Love proximity to airport and all the wonderful restaurants.
50,Even though we were there for a Trade Show we had an excellent time at Mandalay Bay. The hotel is clean interactions with staff is friendly and food choices was good. We have no complaints at all and stayed 1 week. Hopefully their rates will be competitive with other hotels/casinos on the strip and allow us to stay there again. (Our company brings multiple employees to the shows)
50,Hotel was great. Mobile app for check in and room key was really easy to use and saved time getting to our rooms. All the restaurants where great! I liked that it was connected to the Luxor and from there it was easy to get to the strip.
20,56th floor great strip view. Bathroom required special housekeeping visit to achieve acceptable cleanliness.    Missing chairs to enjoy view. Leaky window vent noises & freezing toes.    Did like online checkin & easy key creation.
50,Traveled to Vegas for surfaces flooring show have stayed at other property's in the past Mandalay Bay by far the best my show was right there in the convention center . learned that the MGM property's are 80 0/0 run on there own solor grid saw the 640 acre solor field from the plane on the way in .
50,First time staying with them and it was amazing. Rooms were clean staff was great!! We used the valet the whole weekend and they were on top of it never had to wait long to get our car. Definitely will be staying with them again!!
50,Had a great time staying here!! The staff was great. The room I had had an amazing view of the Vegas strip. Everything you need is in the hotel. Tons of great restaurants casino staff was awesome just an all around great time!!
50,Good room  however I think $20 for a bottled water & $18 for a bag of cashews is crazy haha    But it was a good stay  nice room. Nice showers & a lot to do within the hotel it self. Would stay again !
50,I'm very satisfied with my latest stay at Mandalay Bay. I will highly recommend this property to my family and friends. The room size is excellent and staff are very professional helpful and courteous
50,I do not visit Vegas often but the last couple times I was anxious to get home because the environment was just not enjoyable. This trip I stayed at Mandalay Bay and the employees were very helpful kind and made me feel like they appreciated me being there.
10,Mandalay Bay Hotel skimps on everything from soap for the shower to the ability to put your own items in the mini fridge. Here’s a picture of the sign by my mini fridge saying the hotel will charge me $50 if I put my items in it. Want a complimentary cup of coffee in your room? Not at Mandalay Bay $12 to make coffee with the mini room coffee maker. And noises I deducted were coming from the hotel plumbing system whirrs clicks swooshes all day and night. Not even background white noise it’s sporadic and some creeks and clicks louder than others. Had to play music on my phone all night in order to drown out the noises and sleep. And no alarm clock in the room so when I woke up every few hours had to lift and look at my phone because there was no clock to glance at. And a map of the grounds would have been considerate with the enormity of the hotel and casino but you’re on your own finding restaurants in Mandalay Bay. All of the little things this resort hotel doesn’t do adds up to a bad experience. It’s no wonder they don’t ask how your stay was when you check out I think they already know.
40,Beautiful hotel but needs a little maintenance. Ice machine didn't work all the time. Television in our room didn't work (this was taken care of very quickly) carpets are showing some wear. Service was top notch staff was always friendly and helpful. We'll be back.
50,This cool Vegas resort draws a good crowd! And the reason is because of the classy employees that represent MGM in a kind and professional manner. I have stayed here over 5 times in the last 13 months and I'm always happy that I did.
40,Clean and beautiful hotel. We were there all weekend and really enjoyed our stay. The only reason I didn't give it an excellent is we spent a lot of time in the casino and not one single drink was served to us. We had to pause playing to grab a drink otherwise it was excellent.
50,Very nice hotel and casino. Many restaurants to choose from.  Rooms very comfortable and clean. Comfortable beds.  The hotel is connected to the convention center making an easy walk if you are attending a convention.
40,It was such a great time! My wife and I went to celebrate her birthday. I booked in advance so I didn’t have to worry. I would have given 5 stars if I didn’t have problems with the scanner of the hotel room. But even that was taken care of wonderfully. The security guard was awesome and he helped us get it fixed and we were able to make it to our plans on time.
50,Very convenient for attending SCI event. Very helpful staff. Concierge was awesome in extending some much needed help of locating an item left in a cab. Any experience we had with any of your staff from any level was positive and appreciated by us. Everything seemed to flow well from getting into restaurants to having cabs. Thank you and we will always consider you as a possibility to stay with.
50,We stayed at the Mandalay Bay for the first time and it was a really nice weekend! Far enough away from the hustle and noise of the strip but yet close to everything! We will be back! Casino was fun and patrons aren't quite as crazy as some places we've stayed!
20,I reserved a King Resort room aboit 2 month prior but was first given a room that someone else was in so had to go back to. Heck in then was given a queen room bc that all that was available. Not happy. Probably won’t stay here again even though it’s convenient with the convention.
50,this is our go to place when we go to vegas. easy tram to get to the craziness towards NYNY but easy enough to get away and enjoy the more classy and quiet at Mandalay Bay. and the adult pool is always fun.
50,No need to check-in in person after checking in on app. App actually worked! Thanks. Now I'm just typing stuff to get to the 200 letter minimum. Very happy with stay. Will be back. Wow! 15 more characters left.
50,From the moment you walk in the door of Mandalay Bay you know your are somewhere special with it's award winning restaurants from casual Irish Pubs to live Blues Music to high end steaks just to mention a few all within a short walk through the hotel.  We went to our suite and the view was worth every penny looking over the airport on one side and down the Vegas strip on the other.... Amazing! and then up to the Foundation room for drinks..... what a Birthday!!!
40,"Super Fun Time In Vegas "" as Usual"" 1st time staying at Mandalay bay resort & Casino.  Enjoyed My time there great restaurants  exciting Gambling Floor.  Staff was very friendly and Helpful.  I would Highly recommend Staying here"
50,The staff was very helpful when daughter decided to explore the mini bar. They gladly took off the extra charges. Many choices for dining options. I highly recommend the Noodle Shop. Excellent service. Only down side was that there was only one pool open.
50,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We reserved two rooms ours was comped and we had another for my sister and her husband. The young lady at VIP check was very helpful. We were there for the Raider game so we stayed until Tuesday. Only disappointment was some of the restaurants being closed on Monday.
50,My room was very nice and the people were even nicer. Checking in on the MGM app was amazing. I checked in from my phone they sent me a digital room key and I went straight to my room without going to the lobby. Super fast and convenient.
50,This hotel is always clean the beds and pillows are fantastic and there is plenty to do in and close to this hotel! I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else! Despite recent events I always feel safe here.
50,Our stay at your resort continues to be an excellent experience from room service and housekeeping. The only issue we continue to have is the mobile app it a hit or miss getting it to work in the elevator and somewhat frustrating. We always end up getting a key card which is inconvenient.
50,Very nice. My room was clean and comfortable and the housekeeping staff did a great job. Mandalay Bay is one of my favorite casinos. My only issue was the man in the room next to me was talking extremely loud and disturbing my sleep. I could here him through the adjoining door telling people how to bet on sports games.
50,The rooms are huge and the bed is amazingly comfortable! I love staying here because of the huge soaking tub that's included is great for my back!!    The only thing that's kind of a bummer is there's a fridge but you can't use it. It's full of purchase items. It would be nice if they would at least half the space.  I don't believe there's a coffee maker in the room but I always bring my own.  Overall a great place to stay!
50,I've stayed at Mandalay Bay several times for business. Always top notch service with top notch amenities. They've slid into safety protocols in regard to protocol that makes even the most hesitant person comfortable with their surroundings. Way to go MB!
50,We loved our room and all the amenities on site at Mandalay Bay. Only one pool was open but the beach area would be fun in warmer weather. The casino is at the end of the strip so we used the tram often to go to the other casinos.
50,The room was big and clean. The view was beautiful!! Best part....plenty of towels and pillows. The staff is friendly helpful and answered any concerns we had with confidence and sincerity. Will definitely return.
50,Mandalay always the best clean and classy out of the hustle bustle of the strip but still close enough to city center plenty of activities and attractions nice dining and restaurants in  the casino and shops just a great place to stay!!
40,My stay here for business is always enjoyable. The rooms and property are very well-kept the staff is always courteous and there are plenty of restaurants and shops to keep me busy. Just a quick 10 minute drive from the airport makes this the perfect business location for me.
50,My daughter and I spent 4 nights at Mandalay Bay for a short 'girl's retreat'. Our room was really spacious and had an amazing view. The concierge arranged for tickets for Cirque du Soleil -Beatles/Love - and we were very happy with her recommendation. The staff was always helpful and polite. Would love to stay there again when all the pools are up and running. Only one was open which I guess is standard for January.
50,I had a nice trip! Went to go see Carlos Santana at House Of Blues so I stayed upstairs at Mandalay Bay. Parking was reasonably priced at 15 per day which at most concerts here in LA you’ll pay 20-40 just for concert parking let alone overnight! Ha. My room was clean check in was a breeze the app made everything easier (but they still have people if you’re not tech savvy) and I’d go back.
50,Rooms were nice bathrooms were very large with separate shower and tub plus separate toilet area. Lots of good restaurants and bars. Parking garage was off the chain green lights for every empty parking spot and red for occupied spots.
50,I love place! It is rare that you receive above par service at a hotel/casino. Mandalay Bay is one of there rare properties. The hotel staff always make me feel welcome and valued. The cocktail waitresses are incredible.Sherie and Neriza always greet me with a warm hello bright smile and are quick to bring me my favorite beverage. I choose to stay and play at Mandalay Bay due to the staff.
40,Staff was great room was large and clean.. love that we had a coffe pot in room. $10 for a cup of coffee outside of room. casino area is smaller then I would expect. Food is not good at all tried almost all restaurants in hotel.
50,The hotel was absolutely beautiful the rooms spacious and provided comfortable beds huge bathroom large desk area and having so many restaurant choices under one roof was wonderful. There really was no reason to ever leave this property. Spa was also really well appointed and massage was really good! Definitely will stay here again.
50,Mandalay Bay is a great resort very clean & lots to wander & see.    Unfortunately a lot of food service restaurants are still not open. I wish the Hotel would make it more clear that the BUFFET is CLOSED .... I wandered aimlessly looking and finally the next day had to ask a staff member to find out it never came back after the pandemic. Also NO STARBUCKS the two within the resort are closed.    Cant use the in room fridge unless you want to gamble that the weight sensitize bottles move and they charge you for them. No free coffee bummer!
50,Amazing stay! We went as a cousincation & requested to have rooms together. They were able to satify the request. We were on the 14th floor it was super cool! We also requested the have the minibar lock bc our guy cousins would of drank all of the alcohol and they also did
40,Los of little issues but overall nice place. Phone went dead after I used it once. I opted out of housekeeping service but that was ignored. The outlets near the bed didn't work. The in-app key mostly didn't work in the elevator.
50,Great customer service! Staff is super helpful. Staff is friendly. Rooms are super clean. Prices are reasonable fast check-in valet parking has great staff. A lot a of elevators so it doesn’t get too crowded
50,Friendly and pleasant staff. Options to check in from phone app. Clean upgraded rooms! Rooms are conveniently located to the convention center. Multiple share ride locations (Uber). Great dining options!
50,Great place to stay. Lots of choices for food within the Casino. Access to the convention center was convenient as well as to other hotels like Luxor and Excaliber. It is the farthest hotel on the strip across
50,As always the best resort to stay in Vegas. From staff to the rooms to the ambiance and the environment. All hotel staff are extremely friendly and helpful including casino staff. And the casino smells great.
50,Mandalay is hands down one of the best hotels I've stayed at. Quality beds quiet and clean. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Don't hesitate to stay. Staff was always around for any needs. The casino floor is also A+.
30,Room was nice as usual.  Staff was nice overall except for one security guard who was an ass.  The slots sucked overall. That was a bummer. Better off downtown at Gokden Nugget.  Best restaurant was the Noodle Shop. The Chinese man in there is a gem.
50,Excellent experience and overall just a great time. The staff was superb and the vibe was very great too! I enjoyed myself and all that came with it. The casino was great too! I would recommend Mandalay Bay to anyone
50,Friendly clean spacious the hotel rooms casino and restaurants were well laid out spacious. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Food was great casino was very clean. I will always stay here location on strip is great.
50,The room was great & the food there was great & watching the football games was even better on those big screens. Close to all the good places easy travel to the Strip. Will be going back soon when that beautiful pool opens up.
50,Perfect! I will stay there again for sure!  Very clean. Beautiful view. The pool is great. Staff are very friendly. The casino area doesn’t have that horrible cigarette smell as the other hotels in the area.
50,Great place to celebrate. Celebrating a 21 birthday. Wonderful experience asked to show id everywhere. Yahoo covid testing on site masks required yea! We’ll be back in two weeks for a family reunion. Meals super drinks at dinner averaged $20 not so good.
10,Check in is at 3 our room wasn't ready until 5:30 when we went to check on it we were met with total indifference almost annoyance like we were inconveniencing the person whose job it is to handle this. The room we waited for so long was subpar to be kind next to a leaking noisy ice machine that caused our carpet to become damp when we asked for a different room it was denied again no empathy. We requested a trash can and extra pillows and never recieved them even after asking more than once. We have stayed at Mandalay more than half a dozen times and always had good experiences needless to say we wont be staying there anymore. The only great service we had was from Valet and Bell
20,Resort was a total let down for me and I was embarrassed that I took my husband there. It was his first trip to Las Vegas and our first trip together since his stroke in January of 2021  We had to endure rancid food in the hall outside (directly across) from our room. We had shower that need a grout cleaning. We had no placard on the frig or tray stating “if you pick it up any consumable items and don’t put them back in time you will be charged without notice”.
50,Great customer service nice rooms very clean and reasonable rates. The winter pool area being open is a plus and very clean. Access to the tram Uber and bus route is very easy. We would stay here again!
50,Great hotel awesome staff. Beware water is super hot. Pool is very nice and was open in January. They keep the casino very clean as well as the rooms. Since this is at the end of the strip and on the higher side of costs you get a very exclusive strip experience.
40,Mandalay Bay has a great conference center and nice rooms. The restaurants are a bit pricey but that's how things are in Vegas hotels. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Hope we have another conference there in the future.
10,"This ""resort"" lacks in appeal and charges for everything in the room including drinking water ($20) which is absurd. Coffee is provided for a fee as well. Nothing to consume in the room unless you want to pay 2000% mark up compared to grocery store prices."
10,"We had nothing but a host of problems throughout our stay that were completely unjustified for such a supposedly upscale hotel. Constant problems with both digital and printed keys in ALL the elevators and although this took place during a convention over several days and many other attendees mentioned reporting this issue to the front desk when I did the person I talked to claimed to have never heard of any issues with the elevators all week and acted like I was crazy. Literally everyone in the hotel was talking about it and many people reported being told that some of the elevators didn't work and to ""just go to a different elevator."" I and other guests often found ourselves having to get out at random floors after being held hostage by elevators going up and down while we struggled to get our keys to work. Why was this problem allowed to continue over a 3 day convention? Guests are expected to get most of the hotel info and services from use of the MGM app which would be annoying enough on its own but is even more so considering the cell service in the hotel is terrible AND the wifi is terrible so the app either takes forever to load anything or completely times out and asks you to refresh it. Everything that would be standard at any other hotel in Vegas is an extra charge. Service is terrible throughout the hotel. There are no 24/7 restaurants except a subway in the foodcourt and no restaurants or even a Starbucks open before 7 AM which is insane in a large casino like this. Only one of the valet kiosks worked throughout our stay and it prompts you to tip before you've actually received service. I regretted agreeing when we waited for our car for 20 minutes only to phone the front desk (since no valets were around for us to ask) have them transfer us to the valet who then told us that he couldn't locate a ticket for our car. So I guess if we hadn't called the front desk he just would've ignored our kiosk request because they lost their end of the ticket? Why didn't he come down to retrieve mine until we called? I had already paid $31 for my vehicle plus the tip. Once he finally came to retrieve my ticket another 20 minute wait ensued while he ""located"" my vehicle. What a service to actually pay for! I've stayed at many hotels in Vegas and found absolutely no reason to recommend this one. The best rating I can give it on any of the points is ""average"" and for your money you can do much better than this piece of gilded junk."
40,Hotel is clean rooms are comfortable and floor was quiet minus one evening neighbors dog barking..hotel offers mobile checkin/checkout you can use your phone as a digital key really liked this option. Mostly high end dining options in hotel would have been nice to have some other mid range affordable options.
40,We stayed at Mandalay Bay over Labor Day weekend 2021. The rooms at Mandalay Bay were nice. About the same size as you will find at most Casino Hotels on the strip. We had a view of the pools with our rooms.  We ate at a couple of the restaurants at the Food Court the authentic Mexican restaurant was great!  The kids loved the pools and wave pool. It was plenty warm outside and the pools were great to cool off in. There were plenty of spots available to sit but did fill up throughout the day. Access to drinks and food at the pools was very convenient.  We utilized the tram that runs from the Mandalay to Excalibur. It was ideal for limiting steps on the Strip since Mandalay is located at the South End of the strip.
50,Great hotel very spacious room with California king bed that was comfortable to sleep The heated pool was and jacuzzi were my favorites. The casino was very clean and had a ton of fun playing. The bathroom are wonderful too.
50,After reading recent reviews I almost changed hotels however I am so glad I did not. We had a great stay. The Sky View Penthouse suite was amazing and worth the price. Service was great everywhere we went. Drink service while gambling was much more than expected. All meals were good. Only complaint would prefer better signage in casino. It wasn’t easy getting around / learning layout because we constantly felt like we didn’t know where we were going. Maybe a map on the app would help.
50,Early check-in using the app excellent customer service and outstanding suite! The suite was definitely worth the price and we were able to use our phones as key cards instead of using the traditional card.
40,Second time we stayed here and not disappointed. Rooms were really clean (we reserved 1 queen /1 king both so clean- but housekeeping come too early. Lol) . Employees at the check were helpful and friendly
30,Several deferred maintenance issues we noticed. Had a great time loved StripSteak and the show at House of Blues was amazing - such a great venue. The hotel was clean and everyone was nice just needs some TLC around the edges.
50,I've visited Las Vegas for over 20 years and this was my first time staying or even visiting Mandalay Bay. I was attending a conference there which was why I stayed. The rooms were cozy and clean. We had some fabulous meals in several of the restaurants. The walk to the hotels conference center from the hotel wasn't as far as in many other casinos in town. The casino wasn't anywhere near as full as some of the more popular ones which made the stay much more enjoyable. Overall a great experience!
10,Phone didn't work for service no hot water the shower drain would back up every shower. everytime I walk downstairs to try and have someone come up. they never sent anyone. I have to make this review at least 200 charters soooo.
50,Frim the minute I walk in the lobby door and smell the fresh light tropical fragrance I’m happy I pick Mandalay Bay Resort for my Vegas stay!    The 11 acre “pool paradise” is really great with the wave pool for the adventurous the sand beach for those who want more than the average pool area. And for the really adventurous or non self conscious Morea Beach Club during the summer is “top-tional” ( during winter the wave pool is closed but the beach club is full swim suits and open to all.    The casino is fun the Michael Jackson show is great. The restaurants give you a lot of choices from casual and fast to lingering and special.    The conference center is huge and also close to a food court and all the restaurants!    The location is close to the airport. While I’d prefer to be mid strip the wave pool & beach is what keeps me coming back. There IS a team from Mandalay to the other side I’d the Excalibur helping you get up the strip without 100% walking.    When it comes to aesthetics the style is beautiful & serene with lots of gorgeous detailed carved plater work. The feeling is a cross between Polynesian and Taj Mahal on the inside and a shimmering golden glass sky scraper on the outside. The Mandalay Bay Resort makes the perfect end to the strip as the sun sets it looks like the sun itself with the golden reflections off the glass exterior.
50,Housekeeping was amazing and on top of keeping our room clean! The servers at the border grill were amazing! Best customer service I’ve had in a very long time! Casino servers were absolutely great too! Thank you guys for making our vacation the best! We are definitely coming back!
50,Beautiful hotel! Gym is super small though with hardly any weights or equipment other than cardio. The rooms charge you like a mini bar for the coffee which is cheap-I've never seen that before. They supply the coffee machine but charge $5 for the small coffee and cup. Ive never seen a charge for coffee like a mini bar item? Other than that it is a great place.
30,Food drink etc very high in price 2 cups of in room coffee $12.50 bottle of water $6.50 etc. Housekeeping was hit or miss ..one day room not cleaned at all....it would have been 2 days the room not cleaned had I not complained.
50,The staff at the hotel was great. The room was comfy and the Mountain View’s at that end of the strip are fantastic! Enjoyed my stay wish it was warmer because the pool area looked amazing from my room.
30,I found out that Mandalay was charging more than triple what the other sites were charging and even though I called before my stay they wouldn’t resolve. No water in hotel room one day. Loud moist repairs on floor the next day.
50,I was at convention for 6 days. I had one glass of wine each night on the way back to my room. When I checked out all the glasses were still laying around my room. Amenities were restocked but just stacked in a pile on the counter not put in an orderly way. I felt like my teenagers left the groceries on the counter after shopping. The bath at was never replaced and the towels were not picked up from the floor when needing to be replaced. For the expense these things should have been taken care of.
30,We we reimbursed the resort fee for the 3 cold days but we should have been reimbursed the total cost for those days. We waited a long time for the mechanic to come the first 24 hours of our complaint.
10,No water no maid service rude staff. This was my favorite place in Vegas but not anymore. Their service has gone way down hill while prices continue to go up. Expect to pay almost 100 a days for resort fees and parking even when the resort pool is closed???
30,Service was average. Valet parking was friendly and fairly prompt. One day the room was not serviced. We called and towels were promptly delivered. The safe was an issue. Convention center was convenient and big enough.
50,great support from staff. Especially Mr. Choi at the front desk was amazing and went out of his way to make my stay more comfortable and easy with map and directions recommendations and just a friendly smile.
50,I’ve always wanted to stay here but for some reason we have usually stayed at other hotels. I’ve been to Vegas many times and this was by far the best hotel I’ve been to. Great food clean confortable.
40,Nice hotel good location friendly staff rooms cleaned promptly comfortable bathrooms good entertainment and restaurants. The pools are nice and clean. Self- Park price is reasonable. Mini bar prices are a little high but room prices are very good.
30,For the past 4 years our convention was in Reno or Covid cancelled. We were looking forward to this return to MB but not prepared for Las Vegas trying to recoup the losses of the pandemic by price gouging. $5 for a cup of hot water? $9 for small Gatorade? $70 breakfast for 2- omelets? Venue changed to Nashville next year. Hurray!
50,Helpful staff at every turn. Parking was great food was awesome. Some activity not available due to Covid but expected. Should map out an area for cigar smokers only so people don’t have to leave the hotel to visit other off site lounges
10,The pool and spa were close before we even got our room. Apparently I was suppose to get my room by 3pm and no-one text me nor reached-out with no updates. Around 4pm I walk myself to the front desk to inquire about the status of my room come to find out they were behind on clean rooms so they changed it to a two bed room which I didn't mind but I literally had to go ask for it. Why couldn't they offer me that from the gecko. It was my husband birthday and the experience we had was very poor. Also they pool and spa hours are disappointing the pool and spa was closed at 4pm before we even got our room and they still charged me for a resort fee WHAT RESORT?    When I asked about the fee they explained that it wasn't aimed towards the pool and spa that it was towards resort paper printing and amenities... AGAIN WHAT AMENITIES. I literally paid $200 to sleep in a bed at your location. The worse experience ever. Anywhere we been checking in early is never a problem and if no rooms available they offer an alternative. Not here... they just wait until you say something after wasting all day...    I would appreciate if Management would take a look at my review and try to create a solution. As a Marketer and Business Management Consultant I would give my feedback some though and not disregard it as this review can be shared on all sorts of media and business related accounts.    Regards Jose  818-800-8635  jesparza21@avc.edu
20,Water bottles in the room are $20 per bottle  coffee is $12 if you make it yourself .  TV channels were minimal most of everything was pay-per-view television Housekeeping did not come in for 4. Full days  I have forgotten a small item in the room and Lost and Found has not been able to locate it yet much less return it to me.  Will never ever ever stay in this hotel again
50,"This was the Perfect Trip due to an unbelievable casino rep named Tara Rietveld. She anticipated my needs and handled them without me even getting involved. She was so thoughtful and caring I dubbed her my ""Genie in a Bottle""!"
10,I got this room as a comp night as an Mlife Rewards member. This is a classic case of you get what you pay for. Nothing good is ever free. There were so many wrongs I don't even know where to start. The check in was really odd you make your own room key. I saw a lot of others having trouble with the mobile key (using your phone to unlock room) they couldn't get it to work in the elevator so I suggest against that. Bad vibes as soon as you walk in the door. Barley any staff to offer assistance with anything. TERRIBLE smells throughout. Whatever perfume they're pumping into the casino and lobby leaves you with a headache and a sore throat. It's unbearable. The hotel and casino floor was dark and dingy. WORST of all was the room. The water closet where the toilet was smelled of urine so bad that we left our masks on to use the toilet. There were stains on the wall black mold in the shower tattered towels. All the soap offered in the room was almond so with a nut allergy I had no options available. The bedframe had a collection of filth dust and hair surrounding the mattress. We checked out without even spending the night here. I couldn't sleep in such disgusting surroundings. Between the filth the smell and the eerie/bad vibe I couldn't wait to get out of there!
10,My reason for a one star is a result of an incident and a lack of follow up from Security or Guest service. On January 10 2022 with my privacy tag on my door someone entered my room and took my Apple iPad and charging cord for IPhone.  I reported the theft to security on the morning of January 11 and filled out the report they required. On the morning of January 12 I went back to security and asked what they found out. The security officer on duty almost laughed at my question and responded that the investigators probably haven’t even looked at the report yet.  I then went to the front desk and asked them for a key log for my room to see who entered and took my iPad and cord. The person working said they could not give me that information but they would pass on to security.  Upon my return home I received an email asking me to take a survey on my stay at Mandalay Bay. I filled out the survey and expressed my disappointment on one of their employees entering my room while the privacy sign was on and taking my items. I was quite surprised that a Crystal R. from guest relations responded expressing concern over my issue. I was somewhat offended by her comment “if indeed you believe the iPad was stolen you should file a police report. I responded back to guest relations that I indeed know that these items were stolen from an employee of Mandalay Bay and then I filed a Police report.  It has been over two weeks since this incident and while I received confirmation from Las Vegas police confirming my report I have heard absolutely nothing from Mandalay Bay.  From what I have gathered all security would have needed to do was go to the front desk get a key log and identify who came into my room.  I am greatly disappointed on the theft but equally disappointed and frustrated with the lack of follow through by anyone at Mandalay Bay. There was no sense of urgency to resolve a very concerning event on their property.  Don M.
50,We stayed 2 nights at Mandalay Bay. As usual it is very nice and super comfortable. But Sunday Nights band (Swiperight) was fantastic and a must see/hear. We see a lot of bands and concerts and they great. The only thing we noticed is that no one was winning in the casino we did not notice any hand pays or groups of people hooting and cheering and high fiving like we have seen in the past.
30,Parking was confusing to find. The check in reception wasn’t particularly friendly. The rooms are ugly and tired although clean and the bed very comfortable. The towels are small and thin. 1 bar of soap between the wash basin shower and bath. The room was noisy although on the 16th floor. No tea making facilities in the room so at least 1000 steps and 16 floors down and back to get a cup of tea which isn’t much fun on waking. There is definitely better out there and we would not return or recommend.
50,We checked in via the MGM APP. It was easy and loved that there was no need to wait in lines. Room was clean and comfy. View was amazing! Check out was just as easy on the app! Highly recommend MGM hotels. We will return next year.
40,The hotel was nice but the casino was very smoky. Also there was a convention there of the Safari club which is synonymous with Gun club. I have no problem with that my problem is none of them wore masks and they were all over the casino and hotel. Room was nice cleaning did not happen until 10 at night. The refrigerator can't be used it is full of stuff the hotel wants you to buy.
30,I was very happy with the cleanliness of the rooms. Major downfall was the slots being so tight that you don’t even get any playbacks. Hard to play max  Chines when $300 to $400 only lasts 5 minutes. There were only a few blackjack tables open too at night. Hard to get on to play.
20,The cleanliness of our room was horrific. We found what appeared to be smeared blood on the base board of the bed dried food behind the lamp on the nightstand along with crusty pieces of stuff along the wall behind the bed. We complained housekeeping came and cleaned it but left us wondering how clean was our room??? Next day after housekeeping came we found no new towels in our bathroom trash was not empty and a dirty cleaning rag left on the bathroom counter by our toothbrushes. Seriously? Was that rag used for cleaning the toilet??? We always stay at the Venetian and took a chance with Mandalay Bay since we were there for the SCI convention. We won’t be back
50,Everything was smooth from check in to check out. The only thing was our keys were deactivated even though we had a late checkout so we had to stop by the front desk to get new ones. Was not notified that would happen. Highly recommend Citizens! So yummy and open pretty late
10,No amenities in room. $20 for bottle of Fiji water no complimentary coffee and no fridge for personal use. Floor was dirty and I reserved a king room and got two queen beds. Was told they sold all the kings and I could change rooms the next day (after my convention started)
50,My husband and I have stayed at Mandalay Bay a few times during a 1-night layover. Only $20 taxi ride closest to the LAS Airport but has a great strip view (Taxi rides to other places on the strip is $28). Shark Reef Aquarium is also fun!
40,MB continues to be my first choice of resorts to play and stay. Their craps dealers are first rate; balancing professionalism with a casual style making for an enjoyable experience. I only wish they would have more craps tables available. If this doesn't change they will lose a regular.
10,I don't like I was forced to pay them because a counter agent didn't like me. I expect consistency I am not the wealthiest player or person coming to the property but my money is just as green. I hope they get it together soon.
30,In Vegas on a biz trip in the MB convention center which is MASSIVE.  All good with the trip the only upsetting thing is the cost of everything: water in the room = 20 USD (!) Keurig coffee 12 USD and even a coffee + croissant is 11 USD at the bar.  My Crest toothpaste = 15.5 USD (!)  I am fine with vacation and spending but this is just BAD business.  I don't think I'll visit again just for this issue.
30,Housekeeping problems. We stayed 6 nights and our room was cleaned only 3 times. When cleaned dirty glasses were left behind. Not enough towels or soap provided. We had to go down to the front desk a few times because our keyes did not work. Not happy with these inconveniences.
20,The staff was friendly and helpful but the room was a disappointment. Light from the adjoining room streamed into ours and you could hear the neighbors talk at normal levels. The bathroom doors would wake the dead when closed and the conference center was at best a brisk 15 minute walk from the hotel. Also even though we expected prices to be elevated $6 for 16 oz. Of water was a deal!
30,The room was adequate nothing exceptional for the price. I found it odd that they did not have complimentary coffee and tea in the room as well as bottled water. The vending machine down the hall did not have prices listed for bottled water.
10,hotel charged almost $200. for beverage center in room that we did not touch. Poor service took forever to get drinks concierge was nice but took forever to deliver packages sent over from shops. Very disappointed in this stay since it was my birthday trip!
30,In comparison to other properties Mandalay Bay rooms are relatively cheaply decorated. Internet access is poor digital keys did not work in elevator so go to the desk and get a plastic door key.. Alot of the restaurants had limited open hours.
40,Mandalay Bay Convention held the Safari Club International convention. It was a great convention but overpriced facilities. Then convention & fundraiser dinners were done well. The food was good. Staff were helpful.
50,This charming Irish pub tucked in to the shops at Mandalay Bay is a true hidden gem. With the inclusion of history via the 150+ year-old bar from the Olympia theater in Dublin and the fact they used Killbeggans Irish whiskey as there well pour these two facts alone set the spot far away from the rest! Nestled next to the Guinness store the store front looks like a proper Irish pub but it goes so much further back than you would imagine and both the food and the selections show deep appreciation and mastery of the hospitality as well as cuisine of Ireland. Do not miss their take on the snickerdoodle field this place
30,Nothing special here. Just a regular hotel. Uses Covid as a reason that it's rather dirty in the rooms and halls. The bed was comfy the bath stopper was broken but we managed tor rig it for use. Only one set of towels for 2 people for a 5 day stay trash piled outside our door by staff and left there for 2 days. Wasn't what we thought a nice hotel should be and we travel A LOT. The casino was fun. Starbucks got bz but is good (they do have the preorder app option.) The Border was very different and we liked it! Strip Steak made a great fillet but a lousy ribeye. Average as for some things were great and some were not which when added together equals the average stay review.
50,Great hotel easy access to everything with walk ways and tram rooms were very clean and very comfortable everything was spotless food was easy to find and very good had a great time in vegas thanks
40,"As always it was a nice stay rooms are nice and spacious staff friendly. I just wish hotel loyalty meant something here we never get treated to upgrades or anything ""extra"" regardless of how often we stay or for how many years."
30,This hotel is just ok everything is over priced. Hopefully our next experience is better at another hotel. We had t had a good meal until we left the Mandalay property. That's a shame with all the money we spent.
50,Any opportunity that I have to stay at Mandalay I take it. I feel safe. The hotel has everything that I need and the staff is overly friendly. The slots are little tight but that was expected. I still had a blast!
30,I hadn't been to Vegas in a while and it is now 2022 so I am sure things are not quite back to normal but...    Some of the issues seem to stem more from culture and management choices such as design layout amenities etc. I am not sure what kind of traveler this is exactly catering to. Probably suckers and conference attendees. I would pass Mandalay Bay and either go high end or go budget just down the strip because this hotel was neither and certainly no value.
50,I have stayed at this resort many times and as always the facility is great and the service team at every turn always goes above and beyond. The facility is always clean. Several dining options available and have not had a bad experience at any of them. Always a great trip.
30,I was given two queens after paying for a king suite but wasn't told at check in. missing towels and wash cloths and toilet was at a strange angle. generally hard to find any staff. All in all it was dissapointing.
50,Every single staff member working there from the hotel and conference rooms to the casino is polite and happy! Not once did any of them provide any bad service. If I ever looked lost walking around someone asked if I needed help or directions. They also made great recommendations on places to check out in a short amount of time.
20,Stay away if you have little kids because they have a minibar in the room that even it is opened for more than 30 second you will get a charge.    They also have pretend complimentary items on the table that they will charge you for. Beware of those complimentary looking bottled water and coffee cups.
40,So the hotel and the hotel room was great. The pool was amazing and warm even in January. The only negative was that they pump in some kind of scent which (per a Google search) is some kind of vanilla/clove odor. Which sounds okay except that it was SO overpowering that it made both myself and my fiance sneeze cough and feel nauseous which immediately stopped as soon as we walked outside or went into the hotel upper floors. I suspect it's designed to counteract the odor of smoking but it was so bad that we opted to eat outside of the casino and do our gambling at the New York New York instead. I couldn't rave enough about the pool and the room and the ease of the virtual check in but we mostly likely will not stay here again due to that nasty smell.
50,Fun place to stay for a family weekend of soccer. The staff was very friendly. I love the Hazel bar & the food options. I would definitely stay again if I were looking for a “quieter” family friendly place to stay.
30,Room reservation was for a king. Upon check was told none were available. Hotel is at the end of the strip wouldn't recommend for walking to any other locations. Slot play is some of the worst on the strip and tables are limited and minimum bets are high.
40,The hotel room is outdated and has nothing special. The location is good its connected to Luxor and Excalibur. The tram is very helpful after a day of walking. The aquarium is a great experience. The hotel is quiet and safe.
40,"Room was huge had a jacuzzi tub and a great shower.  Good water pressure and was pretty quiet on my floor. There was a nice workstation there to set up my laptop and work when I wasn't in the convention area.  Have a steak at ""StripSteak"" --absolutely delicious!! Our waitress was outstanding too--didn't get her name but she was always stopping to see if we needed anything else and filling our drink glasses."
50,The whole experience was fantastic. The rooms are very spacious and clean. The casino is lots of funwith many amenities. The lounges are great and the night clubs are a blast. There are plenty of restaurants with great food also.
40,We were on the 25th floor and had an amazing view of the strip. The hotel is super well organized and made it easy to get around.    The only real negative about the room was that it was very noisy. We could hear our neighbors TV and there was a helicopter sound that was on and off the entire stay.    Overall it was a great value and we would stay here again.
20,Arriving it was super confusing to figure out how to get to the front doors and ever more so to find the check in desk. Room was clean but a lot of things were broken: doorknobs tub was leaking and no soap.
40,the casino was ok. check in was easy until my mobile key would'nt work. no free coffee in the room or cable tv. therre was a early check out than what i usually have at other hotel. it was great to be able to check in early and they changed my room real fast when i need it
50,What a terrific experience from our arrival to depart. The hotel was immaculate and staff was both professional and friendly all except for 1 employee in Room service. Spa/massage wonderful as well the convention staff. Food was great and varied
50,I had the pleasure of staying at Mandalay Resort & Casino during a recent business trip. I was very impressed with the cleanliness of not only my room but the entire resort/casino! The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. And the parking garage location made it easy access to the main lobby and elevators - unlike most in Vegas that involve what seems like a 2 mile journey while dragging your luggage!!
50,Room are clean and specious and friendly staff very helpful! Will definitely come back beds are so soft and comfy my family and I loved it!! My 3 year old Keeps asking to go back he loves the pool lol 😊
50,The Mandalay Bay was great! Initially I didn't want to stay so far south on the strip but I'm glad I did. This hotel was clean very friendly customer service. There's lots to do within the hotel and there is a tram to get to sister resorts and make your way further down the strip.
30,Although the hotel is kept nice and clean there are a few problems with it.    It is too far from the main strip.  The valet entrance off of Las Vegas Blvd. needs to get fixed because when you enter you have to drive through a maze to get to either South parking or to valet it just doesn’t make any sense the way it’s set up.    The amenities In the room are sparse even though they charge a $40 a day resort fee. In our room which were two queens we had one tiny bar of soap and 1 tiny bottle Of shampoo and conditioner the room did not have any hand towels or face towels. I had to chase down a maid to get them from her.    For a town that supposed to be 24 hours a day this hotel has very limited food options that are 24 hours for example the coffee shop is not open 24 hours if you are hungry at 2 AM you are relegated and forced to eat a Subway sandwich.
50,One thing I appreciated was soooo many good tasting food options. The room was fantastic! I was impressed by the wonderful aquarium. The beach was closed because it is winter but the staff was very helpful and there was so many things to see and do just within the hotel. Not to mention it is connected to the Luxor and Excalibur which gave us endless options for entertainment. There is a shuttle between the three hotel which was a major convenience.
20,We were given keys to our room and when we arrived maintenance was there and said our room was not ready. I called the front desk and was told the only resolution was to leave the room and wait for another room to be ready. I was also unsatisfied with the fact that there was not a single trash can in the room we had to stack our trash on the floor!
50,I love being able to book and check in all from my phone with ease and not having to interact with many people. The rooms are always nice and clean and affordable compared to other strip hotels. The bathrooms are lovely and the water get very hot a plus for me.
10,Rooms smell like cigarettes and was really darker illumination in the room was horrible and tv are small plus every morning smell like cigarettes even tho we don’t smoke valet parking never friendly they worry more about their tips than their service can’t even find spot to charge my car they are no friendly ev cars in the hotel and they charge 30$ a day for valet NOT WORTH IT! Thought service would be better
40,My husband and I traveled for business in January 2022. Our room and the service was nice. It definitely met expectations for Vegas travel. We enjoyed our stay the convenience the food etc. There was a MAGNIFICENT dealer Laura on the Roulette tables. She has been at it over 20 years and made our learning and winning fun! Highly recommend you stop by her table anytime.
30,Make sure you get all the 411 when it comes to the fees for the hotel. Make sure the front desk notifies you about all the resort fee and parking fees. Make sure to know what items are complementary in the room other wise you’ll be charge even for the air you breathe!!
50,The rooms get cleaned and sanitize everday. The hotel itself has the aquarium reef that makes me chose this hotel to stay as it will be good for families with children. It’s just a little far from the strip but its all good coz its very easy to take an uber/lyft from the hotel.
50,From valet to front desk to room service everyone was nice and helpful. Definitely recommend and will be back for our next stay. Sports book area great for watching games and having drinks with friends.
50,"There were 7 in our group and we all enjoyed the accommodations. We also had the Two bedroom suite to meet with the group for pre-party drinks and snacks. We had fun in the casino and had great food and music at RiRa Irish pub. We had one ""Vegas Virgin"" so we did lots of fun stuff so she could get an overview of Vegas sights to see."
40,We stayed at Mandalay Bay for a getaway. The rooms and resort are very nice but the toiletries and bathroom is hit or miss. They did not give us hand towels or wash cloths and only shampoo and contiioner for the first two days. After that they left shower gel and lotion. The remote didn’t work and neither did the one they brought to replace it. All in all as good stay.
50,Everywhere I went on my business trip including Mandalay Bay was exceptional. Friendly kind cautious with staying covid safe. All restaurants BEYOND delicious and plentiful. Best visit yet from many Vegas trips over the years. Vegas is ready for you when you are comfortable traveling.
40,Great rooms staff restaurant options etc. The only negative would be they have security staff walking around the casino floor looking for people who are not wearing a mask or do not have it over their nose. I will say until the loosen the mask requirements to optional I will not be back to Vegas.
10,Took 45min to get our bags from Bell desk with NO LINE no reps in sight around 9:30p on a Saturday night. Then when trying to get help from any hotel employee we basically got ran back and forth and up and down the lobbies by the employees at front desk with NO ACTUAL ASSISTANCE OFFERED & we ended up missing most of our later reservations we had for my 40th birthday and kind of ruined what we had planned for a great night in LV for my 40th. I would not pay to stay here again. Room was ok. Tub was dirty.
10,Free drinks if your gambling?? Only if you can find the one waitress working the floor. Otherwise plan on spending 30 plus bucks at the bar! Staffing is making their experience a sad one. No nobody cares!!! Cut the trip short two days to get out of there!!
30,The wife and I decided to spend the holiday weekend in Vegas for a few nights to get away. We decided to choose this property because it is very highly rated and towards the quieter side of the strip. The overall property and amenities are great however the room experience wasn’t as great. Poorly ventilated stuffy and not cleaned.
50,I have loved coming to the Bay for the past 10 years! It is always nothing short of amazing! It is both Classy and Luxurious! The rooms are always gorgeous as well! The staff here is extremely helpful and friendly!!
50,Stayed at MB many times each year over the years while in town for work then moved to Vegas. Still one of my top faves on the Strip. Just the right size. Great restaurants and bars. Great spa. Recommended.
50,on my recent visit to vegas I had to split my time between Mandalay and Treasure Island. And I can indeed say the Mandalay is the far better property. I wish I had stayed here the whole time. The rooms are so spacious well designed luxurious baths excellent bedding. the wifi is great quality high speed. you just feel and know youre staying at a premium destination.
50,Cleanest casino on the strip to me and great restaurants. The live music is always top notch every night. The staff are courteous and helpful. Rooms are clean. Overall I love staying at Mandalay Bay for my LV trips.
50,Came here for our first Raiders games. Walk to beer garden pregame and Raiders stadium of course. Exceptional service comfy rooms 😬 Even if there isn’t a game I’m staying here again. Go Raiders!!!!
50,Smells amazing when you walk in the doors very clean. Staff are all very helpful and friendly. Convenient location Tram from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur. Short walk to New York New York . Lots of slot Machines.
10,When we arrived there was blood on the sheets and stains in the tub. It took 3+ hours for someone to come change the sheets in the bed. There was no fridge to store personal items. Room service was fine but didn’t come with a tray just in a to go bag. We couldn’t get anyone to come take the trash afterwards until the maid came the next morning. There was no trash can in the bathroom. Trying to connect with the staff over the phone took 30+ minutes each time (we tried twice for two separate things). Wi-Fi also didn’t work on our floor and neither did cell service.  The only positive is it’s connected easily to the Raiders stadium. That’s why we chose to stay there. Even so if we come back for a game we will be staying somewhere else and either walking or taking a ride.    One of the worst hotel experiences I’ve ever had. Felt like I was staying in a $50 a night motel not a $300+ with fees per night Vegas Casino/Hotel.
50,This resort is really nice to stay at very clean and the staff was super nice and helpful. Has great verity of restaurants to enjoy and if not hungry they have a cool bar to hand out in the middle of the casino. What to see the stadium it’s in walking distance from the resort. I will be staying here again.
50,The Mandalay Bay is a great hotel located at the end of the strip making for rather easy parking. There are also tons of restaurants and stores to visit along with a great assortment of slots and table games.
50,When I arrived at Mandalay Bay I was surprised by my hotel room. It so huge the bathroom was so delightful. It had a huge jacuzzi. The hotel was amazing. It has access to 4 seasons and Luxor hotels.
50,The property is beautiful.  Our king room was clean large comfortable and had everything we needed.  The casino is huge and there are many choices of restaurants and shopping.  We used the pool and hot tub and enjoyed both.
40,Great location and easy to travel between hotels without going outside! Air flow in the hotel was good and the staff is very accommodating. Had a great time even though I lost money which I had allocated for anyway. Hope to get back there soon! I LOVE VEGAS!
10,I selected the Media Suite - BIG MISTAKE. The hdmi connector to the theater system did not work and engineering couldn’t fix it though they came to the room to try. Apparently the know “it doesn’t work to well.”  The steam shower also did not work and could not be fixed. I asked to switch rooms to one that had working features but no other suites were available.    On a positive note the Border Grill Cafe was very good (Mexican restaurant near convention center).
50,The best experience from check in to leaving the parking lot... I did not experience one bad thing everyone so helpful no matter how lost I was in the casino... The time just flew by....Ready to come back soon Thank you for being the best!!!!!
10,We requested our bags once in our room continued calling for over three hours no one answered the phone. We missed going out since we couldn’t change after a 11 hour drive our friends had to leave the next morning! Wasted trip!
50,Our room was clean and the staff was all very friendly and helpful. The casino was fun and not jammed with people which was just fine with us. It was nice to have the option of having a pool open not many places do in December and the hot tub was awesome! We love the location of Mandalay Bay.
50,Have stayed here many times but this was my first taking my family for a family wedding. Customer service was impeccable and any time we needed something Mandalay Bay was there to help. Beautiful in December for Christmas time. Thank you for making this a family experience they will never forget!
50,We had a lovely time staying at Mandalay Bay away from the noise of other casinos. Good rooms and excellent choice of food. Staff were very friendly. Only thing that bothered us was the unavailability of coffee in the early morning hours.
20,Their SOP and how things are communicated need immediate oversight i talked back and forth about the same matters; yet their response is extremely slow and lack sufficient training. i suggest the manager supervise the entire procedures
50,We enjoyed everything in Mandalay Bay. But the only drawback is the resort fee and parking fee too high. If they can reduce the fee in the futurethat’s perfect. Also the buffet is not good at all. They need to improve the quality.
10,Many restaurants closed (somewhat understandable but adjust the damn price on your rooms )sports book is a joke and closed poker tables cash games day and night the last two days of my stay. Mandalay has gone off the ledge…
50,Had two separate room reservation for our stay. Front desk workers to accommodate our stay without us having to change rooms. Bathrooms are beautiful. Beach onsite experience is awesome. Stadium walk to the Raiders facility is close and easy.
40,"I love staying at MB. Especially when on a high floor with the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the airport. Magical. However this last time I had real issues with getting mobile check in and the self-parking barcode to let me out of the structure. Both did not work and I had to find alternative means. The staff seemed to know it didn't work and suggested I just use the key card and call the attendant whenever I left the facility. Disappointing that this ""higher class"" hotel hasn't worked out the bugs yet."
30,difficulty with check in and using the mobile app. unfriendly staff both on the phone and at check-in. difficulty using the mobile digital key to access the room in the elevator when others were also present.
20,"Hotel was nice and room was clean.    I know Vegas is expensive but $10 or $20 for a minibar bottle of water is absurd. $10 for a cup of coffee in the room (just bring your own cups and k-cups). I don't even remember the prices on the other things--something like $20 for a small bag of trail mix.    Starbucks closed early so no available to-go cups in the late afternoon or beyond.    I also didn't expect a ""resort fee"" at checkin but after paying that I would expect the in-room food/bev to be a little more reasonable. A few times I would have overpaid for coffee/water in the room but not at that gouging price.    Next time I'll stay elsewhere--this was the first and last time I stay at Mandalay Bay."
50,Again nice hotel and very close to the stadium casino was nice and food was good but I wish there was a coffee pot in the room for free aspecially for what the room cost it crazy you have to pay $ 12.00
10,Service was terrible overall. Haven’t been in 11 years and now I know why. It didn’t get better it got worse . Probably won’t come back to this hotel . And it’s sad to say that because it was always my favorite ..
50,We had a great time and didn't even need to go anywhere else everything we wanted to do in Vegas was available at Mandalay Bay! We were visiting for Cowboy Christmas and the Mandalay Bay Convention Center was better shopping than the LV Convention Center plus MB had food entertainment seating for rest or to rest and watch/listen to the entertainment.
50,Definitely recommend for families. Very clean and calm environment. Kids loved the aquarium. Rooms were a perfect size. View of stadium was great. Also view of pools was beautiful. Easy access to ice-cream for kids.
20,A good place with below average value. It can be done better by simplifying things. I did mobile checkin 2-3 days before my stay to escape the checkin line but still I have to wait in line to get the room key card to get into the Elevator as It is not accepting Virtual Key
50,This was a getaway for my wife and I we had dinner at the House of Blues we gambled in the casino we walked the grounds we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves stay once and you will not stay anywhere else we have stayed at several upscale casinos in Las Vegas in the past this was our first time here
50,As a chef who travels almost every week I have to say that Mandalay Bay has everything you could ask for. Quiet room soaker tub great wifi stocked mini bar 12+ restaurants and bars gambling the market fedex store pool and entertainment and a connected shopping mall all under one roof.
30,Stayed wknd for the football game. Clean room. Tv was not functioning and it took several requests to have engineer respond to address issue.    Frontdesk check in stafff member not very friendly.    Noodle shop service was geeat but food was medicore.  Hissongs cantina staff were very accomdoating to extend their hours to service hungry football fans. Food was medicore but their accomodation was very appreciated by dozens of hingey and desparate fans
30,We were in town with 3 other couples for a Raiders game. Big plus of the hotel was the proximity to stadium.    Otherwise hotel was…fine. Nothing outstanding comes to mind. Everyone we traveled with commented on how incredibly dark the rooms were even with all lights on. Also there were no fans in the bathrooms whicj was unexpected. Finally the towel situation was weird. We only got 2 bath towels. When I asked the very pleasant housekeeper for more bath towels and washcloths she said I’d have to call the desk because that was all she give. I’ve never been on a hotel that wouldn’t give washcloths automatically before. It was just odd.    While the Mandalay Bay was clean and in a good location I’d probably stay somewhere else the next time I go to Vegas.
10,Checked in and was given a room that was dirty. Nothing is worse then checking in and not being given a clean room. They were working on the heat and was told that room would be affected and it seemed the front desk agent just kept bypassing with problems rather then making my stay comfortable. Very very dissatisfied
30,First trip to Vegas. Nice place. Long flight hoped for shower get to room and shower broken. Called it in right way. Repair didn't happen until Saturday night. So we stunk the whole weekend. TV didn't work either. Located JUST far enough outside the main strip that it's a bit of a hike on foot. Concert at HOB was cancelled to which was a major bummer. All in all nice place poor experience.
50,I had a wonderful experience at Mandalay Bay I would recommend this hotel to anyone The service was great the rooms were wonderful location of room was wonderful. I dined at three different restaurants all of them were great
40,Staff is friendly and professional security was very good I felt safe at this hotel however the food could be better for the price. Hotel is very clean and has easy access to the Luxor and Excalibur. We had a great time.
50,Shark Reef is inside the hotel. There is a Tram (Free) that takes you to and from Excalibur hotel/strip making a few stops along the way. Buy shark reef tickets through 3rd parties at the hotel price is $30 per person.
50,Loved our stay. Fast check in. Rooms immaculate. Plenty of space and loved the large bathrooms. Nice to have room service even during Covid. Would stay there again felt it was worth the charge for the room and especially convenient if going to a raiders game.
30,The food was very much overpriced. The cleanliness of my room was okay but not great. The bed was absolutely horrible. The casino comp system leaves a lot to be desired. When using Uber they we're forced to go to the far ends of the hotel and could not pick you up in front at the main entrance and that was a big issue
30,Very disappointed this is a upscale hotel and from the get go check in was late room not ready then no cold water just hot for the 2 day that I was there they gave me a credit for parking only and a voucher for food when I was already about to leave no one call to say they were sorry for all the mishaps
50,Mandalay Bay has great food entertainment slot play and by far the very best race and sports book area in Vegas. The service by the VIP group is fantastic. when we go in the summer the pool area is huge and fun for all. If you want a great place to stay go here. Ken Joseph
30,Hotel is great use the app so no need to deal with staff. No comp items in the room (ie coffer or water) so $20 for a $3 water which appears to be free (rates are supposed to be on TV but TV did not work). Also no day passes available at spa. Must chose a service at the time available if you don’t plan way in advance you get no spa benefit. Unless you want a very structured vacation stay somewhere else that offers flexibility. This is the reason for little value for the cost of the room.
10,Woke up at 3am on my travel day to find that I had no water in my room. The entire floor had its water shut off. I had worked the night before at CES and was in need of a shower before flying. Had use Fuji water to take a sponge bath. Their compensation was $75 in Mini Bar fees! And overall the rooms the carpet even the casino feel dated. Needs a makeover.
50,This hotel is great if attending a football or hockey game both within walking distance. If you are headed to the Grand Cayon or any other state the hotel is close to the major highways.  The hotel was clean plenty of restaurants to choose from. From causal to fine dinning.
40,Good Service Excellent Cleanliness Excellent room with lots of space I loved the bathroom with a lot of space and most importantly the toilet separated from the rest of the bathroom. I like the location.
20,Left my stay early to go to the Four Season. Horrible check-in process; waited 2 hours for a room. Then found stains on the turn down sheet and urine on the toilet seat. I was switched to a different room that had a dirty shower. Housekeeping came to clean the shower.
40,It was expensive but the room was spacious comfortable and clean. Beds were comfortable. Front desk check-in was efficient and friendly. We were there 3 nights. One morning there was low water pressure or hot water but we were told that one guest left the overflowing bathtub running for hours and made a huge mess. Created a big problem for a lot of rooms. We had housekeeping service one day. The next morning I only asked for a couple of extra hand towels but she was unable to locate any. A little surprising considering the price we paid. It was our first time staying at Mandalay Bay and we would stay there again.
30,Overpriced for what you get. I was disappointed to learn coffee was $12; all other hotels I’ve ever stayed at at least offered complementary coffee. The ability to check-in using the app was nice; however the digital key didn’t always work in the elevator. I did appreciate the early check-in option. I guess I feel that I’ve stayed at nicer hotels that offered more complementary services. I didn’t think the $39 resort fee was worth what we got which I felt was nothing.
10,For a “signature property” this was very disappointing. Room cleaning was sporadic. Some days two towels left some days one. Towels should have been replaced years ago. They are thin and scratchy. Then they turned the hotwater off one night till the next morning (late morning) making showers impossible. No pricing menu on snack and water items in room. I only used a bottle of water until another guest told me they were $40 each. They were never replenishes anyway and I still don’t have a bill to verify. I won’t be staying here again
50,Mandalay Bay is one of the best places I have ever stayed throughout all of my years of traveling. The staff is very kind and helpful the rooms and facilities are top notch and my overall stay and experience was completely excellent!
30,Room location not meeting my expectations.  When I reserved my room I was told that we'll be getting a room with the strip view. We moved to a different room but I had to pay extra for it. They shouldn't promise something that they are not going to give you.
50,It's been many years since my family last stayed at the Mandalay Bay. It felt refreshed in many areas and we had a pleasant overall stay. Maybe due to the holidays the person at the front desk was kind enough to waive the parking fee during our stay but you would normally need to pay. We signed up for M-life to accrue points. Once you hit silver parking is free I think. If you do pay for parking your parking pass is good for all of their properties on the Strip.
50,The overall stay was very good my only concern is that enforcement of Covid protocol was not stable. Too many people were not following and staff did not seem to enforce. If you are going to post demands from guests please make sure to enforce with everyone. Everything else was great.
40,My overall experience was great. The beds were comfortable and room spacious. On the other hand all amenities comes at a cost; self parking coffee and use of the refrigerator. The rooms doesn't come with face clothe must request from housekeeping.
50,"The hotel was excellent. Service was extremely prompt and professional. The hotel hosted a ""Cowboy Christmas"" event with a large and varied selection of vendors. The restaurant we dined in was excellent and there were many selections we chose from the food court which was very handy. Would highly recommend Mandalay Bay."
50,Clean spacious room. Beautiful hotel. Wonderful staff. I couldn't have been more pleased with my week-long stay. The aquarium is a must-see. It was a great family vacation. We will definitely be back.
50,Front desk was great!!! Upon arrival with friends they were able to check us in together and get our rooms side by side. They accommodated our last minute requests and made sure our parking was covered. The staff was friendly and professional and willing to go above and beyond.
30,Got to my room everything was outdated. Went to turn on the tv showed an error code as it was not working. Called down to the front desk and was told an engineer would be up to fix it right away. Returned to my room later that night and still was not fixed. Called down to the front again and let them know this was the second time calling about the tv not working which they had the nerve to give me an attitude saying they do not know when the engineer can come but assured it will get fixed right away. Third day came my check out day still not fixed. Went to the front desk and let them know how unsatisfied I was with their service and was still given an attitude by staff and the manager. Never again will I stay at Mandalay Bay.
50,I love Mandalay Bay for many reasons here are just a few...  Location: On the strip but not in the thick of it  Restaurants: Wide assortment; multiple 5 star  Casino: It's just the right size; not too big and not too small.  The indoor mall: Plenty of shops and restaurant  Service: It's impeccable  Hazel Coffee Shop: Absolutely the best!!
50,I really enjoyed my time at Mandalay Bay...Super friendly employees across the board. Very clean. It was just a very enjoyable visit. I enjoyed the location the price and how convenient it was to all of the Strip. I would stay there again for sure.
50,Comfortable beds clean and spacious room. Excellent customer service. Easy selfparking. Very nice strip view room. We enjoyed Bering in 59th floor. Check in with the app was time saver. Check out using the room tv was very easy.
10,They don’t give you a mini fridge for your personal use. It’s an outdated dark cave of a hotel. The prices for the rooms are overpriced. The restaurants have good food but its not Paris quality. Expect dirty glasses to be left around the casino.
50,Excellent service and the rooms are Huge about 575 square feet. Highly recommend. Lots of food choices. Easy parking and vary convenient. The kids loved to stay at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and we will be back for sure
50,Had a Great time! Did wish some of the restaurants/bars stayed open later. Friendly helpful staff. Wish location was closer to the strip but walk wasn’t too bad. Had to call to get clean was cloths for the bathroom but service was quick.
50,Stayed here with my husband for couple of days in December.  The rooms are very spacious - big tub and a walk in shower.  The bed is big and comfortable.  Couple of things I'd like to highlight: Not even a cup of coffee or a bottle of water is free in the room. For the amount of money you spend across the hotel and the MGM Group you should be in a position to at least have a coffee machine or a bottle of water complimentary.    There were very few amenities in the room and very few towels provided.    The service was only ok it appeared like we were more in the way of the staff than actually wanting to be looked after. Check in took 30 seconds we were not provided any information and we had to then line up again to ask questions. Very impersonal. Everything is automated such as check in and out as if they didnt want to deal with you but happy to take your money.
40,was very unhappy being woke up in the middle of the night by the heater then having to pack up and change rooms. the fridge was locked and I could not retrieve some food that I had place there. I also have never been in a hotel that had a coffee pot without complementary coffee Let alone 6$ a cup.
50,From the moment you park to check in to the moment you check out to leave every one you encounter is just so wonderful and helpful. They are always eager to help very understanding and kind and professional. My husband and I have been here at least once a year for the last 3 years since we have been together. And we will definitely return!
40,Stopped at Mandalay Bay as the final stop of my cross country drive with my dog. Want to get a massage and relax in a cool city. The resort was awesome everything was high class and done well. I felt safe and secure being there. It was a huge plus that this resort is also pet friendly made my stay so much better.
50,I stayed for 3 night for celebration for new year all staff room condition and all other service were good and winning a lot for gambling. nice restaurant for breakfast and dinner drink. Wish to stay more but need to come back for work so sad 😩
10,When I first checked in I didn't get the room that was confirmed.  I was suppose to have a King bed. I was told during check-in that only two queens were available. When I got to my room it was filthy dirty and a bunch of hair was stuck in the drain of the bathroom and the toilet has urine stains on it and the room was full of dust.
10,We had 4 nights comped and only wanted to stay for 3. Went to the front desk checked in told them we wanted to stay three nights they booked us from the 28th to the 31st. We showed up to our room after a long day on the 30th and we were locked out I went to the front desk and they said I was only booked for two nights and I would have to pay for the third night which was going to be $280 and for some reason turned out to be $408. We are gold members and exclusively stay at in life properties but unfortunately I don’t think we will be after the last two experiences.
10,I also got sick on the last day of my stay and they didn’t allow me to stay an extra day after being a loyal and good costumer for years…  I’ve been going to Vegas usually 5-15 times a year and after that i see MGM like my family but…
50,We would def stay here again! Our first time to Vegas and out of a lot of the hotels we went in and out of this was by far the nicest/cleanest and very easy access to everything including the city bus! Only thing I think is not right is the resort fee per night when all the outdoor things were closed. I don’t think they should charge if you can’t use.
40,The room was nice and clean. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The staff was friendly. The room was only cleaned once while there. Having to contact desk for a fridge or pay $50 to use the same fridge as min-bar was a little high. All in room items were priced way too high as well as shops.
30,"Issues with the rooms - one had a TV remote that was not functioning well (low battery - worked maybe only 25% of the button presses) the other had a heater that didn't work. Neither was stocked with hand towels or wash cloths - only the larger bath towels.    Front desk was extremely helpful and polite and credited us $100 to use for on-site dining because of the remote/towel/heater issues.    The rooms were also never serviced by housekeeping. Let staff know but was never resolved even though were were out of the room most of the day after letting them know and didn't have the ""DND"" sign on the knob. When coming back to the room at 1AM after a football game getting that resolved is kind of useless as we checked out the next morning.    Overall a miss and expected more for the price - will consider staying elsewhere in the future for games."
50,I visit Vegas often first time going during New Year’s. A really really good time nice to experience New Year’s in Vegas. Really enjoyed the meal at strip steak. If anyone’s ever in Vegas State Mandalay they should try it.
50,We booked a single king room for one night. On the way there we had car trouble and by the time we got there all king bed rooms were gone :( even though our confirmation stated we had a King room. We were totally bummed but accepted that our first honeymoon night would be in a queen room. Maria D the lobby Ambassador was so friendly chatting with us in line. She was able to get us a suite for the night. I now this is something hotels can do but she wasn't obligated and didn't have to. She went above and beyond to make sure our special day that had some crappy bumps on the way turned out better than we could have imagined! Thank you Maria for making our night so great!!! We love this hotel and plan on staying again
50,Easy check-in fast service. Kind genuine people. Big sports book location with a variety of food choices. Easy access to trams to neighboring casino's. In addition there were great family attactions like the shark reef.
50,Stayed for 2 nights and had a great stay. The hotel was beautiful and huge!! It’s like it’s own city. The room was one of the largest I have stayed in Vegas. Great experience. I would stay here again.
10,Upon arrival we had no toilet paper in our room also no amenities such as soap shampoo conditioner etc. Our TV never worked it showed an error code. We called twice to have it fixed but no one ever came. Also no Coke products were sold anywhere on the property even bars and restaurants. Who in the world wants to have a Jack & Pespi? Definitely the worst of our many stays in Vegas.
20,I am a MLife member. This is a nicer place than the usual vegas hotels we stay at but this really caught us off guard. There was a clump of blond hair of the shower wall. additionally housekeeping never tidy our room up even though we were there 3 nights.
20,Terrible service at the desk. They were rude and incompetent. Took three attempts to get me a proper elevator and room key. Room didn't have working TV and a phone malfunctioned often. Room wasn't properly cleaned sticky dark stains on bathroom floor. Bath tub didn't drain well. Overwhelming marijuana and cigarette smoke in hallways elevators food court etc. This hotel is literally at the end the strip which makes for a far walk if you want to venture out.
30,When we arrived they did not have a room available. After waiting they sent us to a room that wasn't cleaned properly and had a bad smell. We had to return to the lobby to get a new room. For the price that we paid this was completely unacceptable.
50,Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino is my go to hotel to stay whenever going to Vegas. I’ve stayed at this hotel many times during my trips to Las Vegas and I’ve always been satisfied with my experience there!
10,Check in gave me three wrong times. I have a pregnant wife and I paid the early check in fee. They told me early check in was 11am and we went to get our room and they told us it will be ready at 12pm. Then we returned at 12pm since we waited an hour.(which was enough time by all the smokers for a pregnant women). They didn’t care and said now it’s moved to 1pm to have our room. They finally got us in our room around 130pm and would return My early check in money. They stated early check I. Doesn’t have a set time it when they are ready. Overall it was a horrible experience from the start. I won’t stay here again.
40,I gave it a 4 due to it’s location and how hard it is to get to other places from this hotel without the use of the tram. Tram hours were short and had maintenance issues. The hotel itself however was beautiful. I was on the 28th floor in a beautiful 2 bedroom panoramic suite for New Year’s Eve. The weather was really cold so the rooms were also cold due to the floor to ceiling glass windows. The view was amazing. I would definitely come back to this room and hotel. There were plenty of food choices on the property. Staff at the VIP lounge were very nice.
50,I've been staying exclusively at Mandalay Bay for the past few years because of its amenities and the less frenetic feel than other MGM properties further north on the strip. Citizens is my go to choice for lunch and dinner and their waitstaff is always accommodating. .
10,Over the years I have stayed at this property but this trip by far was the worst. They appear to be under staffed which is causing the overall quality to be poor. I did complete my satisfaction survey and I am hoping to get a better response to this poor experience. On the flip side the Concierge Staff & Casino Floor Staff were all amazing along with the Taxi Valet Men.
10,Was extremely disappointed in our stay.  Not all things were bad but the things that were really soured our trip.  1) we had to ask for clean wash rags every single day we were there. I was told about the third day by a gentleman in guest services that there was a shortage of wash rags not only here but everyone on the strip. He was cheeky and had attitude. He said That we could use our dirty rags again. I told him I’m not in the habit of washing my A** with a rag and then bathing with it again. And certainly not when I’m spending several hundred dollars a night.  Secondly  2) there was a $50 fee if you used the refrigerator. Plus any of the items there. I understand if your purchasing drinks or snacks that are available. That’s a choice. But if I have a bottle of water or a dessert we bring back and put it in the refrigerator it was a minimum of a $50 fee.  That’s a huge turnoff to me. At $300/night you would think I could put a few bottles of water or a dessert in the refrigerator to keep them cool.    The good side was our room was serviced and clean nicely with exception of wash rags. And that certainly wasn't our housekeepers fault.  I felt everything we did there was all about squeezing money out of you at an exorbitant rate/amount. I understand vacation areas usually charge more but service is usually second to none.  Price/Cost was second to none. However service fell way short and left us extremely disappointed!
20,Frequent guest of the casino but this was the worst experience ever couldn’t understand what happened if they couldn’t clean a heads up would of been acceptable. Having to call the front seat and being placed on long holds just to talk to somebody was a head ache. Then when I asked will they clean the room the following day they said yes but yet again they didn’t clean. So I called and they said they couldn’t get to it. Again a heads up would be nice.
50,Had an excellent stay at Mandalay Bay. Rooms are very clean and affordable for Vegas. The Staff are professional and friendly. This was my first time staying at the Bay and I highly recommend staying there!
50,I will love to come back to Mandalay Bay in the future. The rooms are really spacious and are thoroughly cleaned daily. We also loved the really big showers and the oversized baths. The views were fabulous.
50,Very nice hotel lots of slot machines to play very friendly staff you’re just on one end of the strip so you’ll be taking a lot of transportation or walking a lot also we staffing shortages seems everything closes by like 10 or 11 o’clock
40,Very good view for the strip. I stayed 4 days in the hotel and asked not to clean the room during staying but asked twice for towels. Only gave big towels not small towels. Seemed like the hote do not have enough towels
50,Since the moment we arrived at the hotel we felt the good and friendly vibe with all the staff !  If you have questions they definitely have a answer for everything and they have a 24/7 bar where they play live music
40,Hotel was nice a bit pricey for New Years but it’s on the strip. The over all service was good. The check in was made easy all by on my phone beside the digital room key wasn’t working on my phone to unlock my room but besides that the hotel was good and the service was also good.
10,Way overpriced for a room where we were treated like a motel 6 customer. AC didn’t work well the repair guy took hours to fix our shower that was missing a knob to make it work. Food was adequate but way overpriced priced. Def not staying here again
10,Mask nazis yelling at guests to wear masks even though masks are pointless. A security guy yelled at me to wear a mask. I’m an Alaska native and that same security guy said nothing to the white guest next to me. Mask nazis. A front desk lady refused to give a key to my fiancé when she forgot her key in the room and she was rude about it. My fiancé was listed as my guest and the front desk refused to replace the key or escort her to the room for evidence of her staying there and they didn’t try to contact me. The desk lady also referred to her as my girlfriend and was condescending to her. My fiancé is Latina so this furthers the case that this resort is racist. They’re at least rude and unprofessional.
50,The Hotel has so many things to do and is very family friendly. It has great pools Aquarium shops restaurants and Casino. It is connected to the Luxor and Excalibur by Tram so travel is always easy! I Would highly recommend .
50,Excellent service and very nice beds and pillows. Would recommend to friends and family. Easy dining access. Parking is convenient with app. Have access to all Mlife Reaorts parking without paying unlike some hotels. Housekeeping is great!
50,Had a great time at Mandalay Bay for NYE! Great entertainment food and service. Can’t wait to come back. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Security was professional and provided suggestions for a wonderful dinner for my family.
20,The front desk customer services messed up and swapped my room and my sister in law's room cause a lot of confusing and time consuming. My sister in law room was's not clean and shower door couldn't open. We waited til 2 am. Without helps. End up we had to fix and clean up by our own. Bad experiences.
10,It was a bad experience. No water in my room the entire stay & the smell of rotten pipes lingered all throughout the hotel. I wish this was not the reality of my stay & really think a refund was the appropriate response.
50,The facility was great. The room was very nice. The things offered at this property will definitely have me coming back. I am going to recommend this hotel to my friends and family. I look forward to visiting again.
10,We used to love Mandalay Bay. This time was terrible. The service was non existent they did not clean our room in three nights and the room and linens were dirty! Also stole $150 from us. So disappointed.
50,It’s close and convenient with the best restaurants in Vegas we’re looking forward to next season already. I loved the EyeCandy bar and Strip Steak Restaurant the room was beautiful with room to stretch out. We’ll be Stay at the Mandalay every time we go to a game.
30,The lady at check-in was nice but did not indicate that they weren't able to give me the room I paid for. My reservation was for a Resort King room and we were given a 2 Queen room. The large tub and separate shower in the bathroom as well as view of the 3 pools were nice. The sinks bathroom counters and tub looked dirty. One of the bathroom's sinks was clogged so it took 5 minutes to drain the water after washing your hands and it spit out some black gritty stuff when using it. In addition to that the phone was broken so we couldn't call the front desk for help. There was no rug for the large bathroom floor to prevent slipping when exiting the shower or bathtub. We also ate at Border Grill and The Noodle Shop in the hotel. For the price we paid for the food I didn't feel the service was up to par for the price.
50,Mandalay Bay casino is well laid out and easy to maneuver. Not a lot of movie screen slot machines or gambling machines. Just does not feel authentic. Would have the old style games. Otherwise it’s a good time as usual to sit and enjoy a drink and gambling.
10,Be prepared for an additional tax of 42 dollars a day that they don't tell you about. Had to change rooms twice because they needed to work on water. Tvs cut in and out. Phone didn't work and never fixed. Don't pay for strip view. You are at end of strip and only have a tiny view of strip the main view is of airport. Don't stay here not worth it
50,After 2 years of not being able to travel to Vegas due to COVID I booked myself back into my favourite hotel In Vegas for 13 nights over Xmas and New Years determined to make up for lost time. However things didn’t quite go the way I expected and in the two years since my last trip I really felt things had changed for the worst!    I phoned ahead with specific requests a high floor strip viewand a non adjoining room (experience shows you’ll hear your noisy neighbours). On arrival at check in I again mentioned this request at reception and was assured this had been taken care of. So after 2 flights and around 16 hrs of travel door to door I headed up to my room minus my golf clubs and assorted clothing as the airline misplaced my bag.  I opened the door to find it was an adjoining room so turned around and headed back down to reception. I spoke to another person at reception who frankly couldn’t have cared and gave me a new room not on a high floor and said this was all they had!    Off again back to my new room to find a phone that didn’t work a TV that also had issues a missing bedside light and frankly a room that was in need of TLC. However I was exhausted and decided to let it go and get on with my trip. However more issues housekeeping twice missed cleaning the room with the second time really pushing me over the edge as i vacated the room early as she was in the room next door and I asked if she was doing mine next which she confirmed. I left room and set out for 5 hours only to return to relax to find room not cleaned. I went to reception and passed over my issues to a receptionist who attempted to resolve all these issues and said he’d remove a couple of resort fees as i had $300 of F&B credit on my room which came as a surprise to me. I thanked him for his help and decided to head to the Casino for a game of poker to find again that the minimum bet was $25 per box or $75 per hand. I called over the pit boss to ask if he could lower the minimum  as twice previously two of his colleagues had. I asked if he could lower bet to $15 and his reply astonished me……He said of course I was welcome to bet $15 or $45 per hand but not here at MB. My reply was okay I’m off to New York New York. Off I went and a couple of hours later ended up in Gallachers Steak house to use up my F&B credit. I had a one course Ribeye with sides and frankly was one of the best meals I’ve ever had and so it should have been at $138 plus tip.  Surprise the next day to find I’d been charged for this meal again back to reception again another member of staff listens to my story he goes to his supervisor who apologised and removed $200 of room charges.  Final say on this trip….due to feeling completely underwhelmed by the vibe in MB dogs barking in rooms kids screaming during the night drunken guests partying in rooms the poor customer service I checked out after 8 nights  rebooked my flight and headed back to the UK completely disappointed with my trip.  I will go back to Vegas but not in as big a hurry as previous trips and after my past 8 trips were to M.Bay I’m not so sure it’s going to be top of my list!
50,had very great stay I stayed in an executive suite nice view of strip and love the larger room that it has compared to other places everything is very convent and had a amazing day at the spa with my girlfriend since we are here for her 21st birthday she couldn't have room under her name but quickly fixed that since I was 22
50,The Online checkin and checkout was great. The clean room and courteous staffs made our short trip hastle free. Overall it was a good experience bec we are able to walk to the strip ride the tram and back safely.
50,Mandalay Bay in my opinion is one of the most beautiful hotels on the strip. Friendly helpful staff. Very comfortable rooms beds. Restaurants: Citizens Fleur Social Libertine and RiRa were fantastic. Shark Reef and 4D show were enjoyable. I hope to go back.
50,Beautiful hotel with wonderful people and amazing amenities. Centrally locates to all of  the wonderful sites on the LasVegas strip. The complementary shuttle was a life saver  after walking around all day. You
40,Great amenities but most were closed for the off season    Need more gluten friendly options at hotel restaurants being Las Vegas I feel this is a highly over looked food allergy and having it clearly labeled in 2022 is a much
30,Well for starter the room we stay in has a few issues going on. The sink in the bathroom started leaking out of blue. There weren’t any bath mats so the floor happened to be slippery. Services are fairly good. People are understanding. But on the other side the fact that guests had to walk through he casino where people freely smoke just doesn’t sit right with me. Im aware its a “hotel and CASINO” but there are kids who should not be expose to the smoking like that. I personally would have to go to a dont-have-casino hotels next time.
40,Mandalaybis a great value property with excellent amenities . The rooms are starting to show their age but are still appointed nicely. Property gets busy when the stadium is full but everything is still well organized. Excellent services from check in lead to a great experience.
30,The hotel is across the street from the Airport. You’ll hear helicopters and planes all night depending on room location. No fridge you can use without a $50 service charge microwave or in room coffee without paying for a coffee cup kit they supply for $6 a cup. No wash cloths or hand towels upon check in. I tracked down 2 different maids to collect 2 hand towels and 2 wash cloths which they took out the room the next day and didn’t replace them even though we left on the vanity not the floor. Don’t make the mistake of picking up the coffee cups or anything else to look for the price because you will be charged for the items you move.
20,The beds are really comfortable I might add but the hotel and service and confused layout of a casino will make u regret not checking into a holiday inn. The check in service was horrible the little Knowledge each employee had was frustrating in the end we got the resort fee waived but doesn't make up for the stress and worry we had the whole time worrying about the room.
50,After returning back to our hotel we realized our hotel is connected to Mandalay Bay. As soon as we stopped by this resort. After walking into the lobby we felt like we were almost at Atlantis. Staff are super polite. I highly recommend this place if you want to visit Vegas.
20,"Well the day my family and I were leaving. I called down to the front desk to try to get a late checkout. I knew it would be a long shot but I thought I would try. I called the front desk and the gentleman on the phone was so rude. I asked for a late checkout and the gentleman on the phone said ""We have no late check-outs and you need to get out of your room"". I don't know if I want to stay at your hotel again."
50,Beautiful hotel at xmas time and the choices of restaurants in the hotel were great. Loved Slice of Vegas! Our room was so wonderful clean and the cleaning techs were very friendly and accommodating. I loved it here. Everything was perfect!!
30,The rooms are very outdated. Definitely needs a renovation throughout the entire facility. The elevators hotel rooms casino etc all show poor maintenance. Though the space seemed clean but showing age and poor maintenance.
50,The staff's was so great we had a great time for are vacation time everything was nice from the front desk to housekeeping and restaurants the 59th floor was so quiet and I needed that rest thx again.
40,Mandalay Bay is a consistent steady top notch choice of the High End MGM properties. It has access to many nice restaurants and entertainment including the House of Blues. We enjoyed our Christmas vacation thoroughly and very good staff.
20,You pay full price but no one is available to service rooms give fresh towels or make bed. I called every day to ask to have my room serviced but I was given a variety of excuses for why it wasn’t scheduled to be made up before my stay was over. Including: staffing shortages the room cleaning service is contracted out as Union. Jobs housekeeping is shoddy on the best of days and today isn’t a good day housekeeping has been suspended. There were other excuse too but that’s what I remember at the moment
20,Agent booked room w/ points. The room we reserved was NOT the room RECEIVED. VIEW WAS NOT THE VIEW WE BOOKED. The excuse given was they were overbooked. Our room wasn’t ready when we arrived which was understandable BUT we were offered a lesser room that was ready. ONLY ADDRESSED WHEN WE CALLED IN TO COMPLAIN. First time experience was uncomfortable because the expectation was ruined from the beginning.
30,Dirty Room barking dogs and inconsistent guest services! Dust everywhere with food crumbs. Carpeting didn't look vaccuumed in awhile. Every night we heard dogs barking. Good service from guest services was very inconsistent.
20,Aging rooms and hotel decor thin walls and barking dogs. Elevator security was inept scary situation with man sneaking into elevator and eying our exit. The thought of Sex trafficking/kidnapping kept me up all night with two teen daughters.
20,First 5 nights were great. Great price due to Christmas and covid. The last night was unacceptable. Security entered my room while I was in bed claiming a welfare check because I left the do not disturb sign on the door for 2 days. And woke up at 3 am to finish packing and leave for the airport. Absolutely NO running water. No shower no toilet action no teeth brushing water. There was no notification for this which left me struggling to do my best to prepare myself for a long travel day. This was TERRIBLE at best.
10,First thing I go and check in and they have me in 2 bed room stay. I told the guy if there is a one bed stay and he said no. I ask the lady right next to him while I was walking out and she said yes. I get to my room the TV doesn't work. So I called the front desk and told them. Guess what it was never resolved. Not to mention next door were loud as hell so I didn't even get any rest. Mandalay Bay Resort my ass. Never staying here and I suggest the same for everyone.
10,Don't waste your time and money staying here. You will be treated as a number and not as an important guest. Be prepared to be nickeled and dimed at every step of the way. Locatin to Allegiant Stadium makes this a car and person traffic nightmare.
30,The hotel is at the far end if the strip so it’s hard to get to the other hotels. We didn’t receive housekeeping service one day. On our last night the water stopped working and we kept calling the front desk but never got a real person to speak to
50,The staff was wonderful! The hotel was very nice and everything was centrally located and easy to find. The House of Blues has delicious breakfast lunch & dinner! Awesome experience! The Tram was convenient it allowed you travel to other hotels. My experience was awesome!
40,Great stay gorgeous room and friendly staff! There were no significant issues during the stay except leaving the self parking lot. The room was gorgeous! Very clean and spacious.  Definitely will be staying there again soon
40,Overall Good Experience. The checking in process was smooth - I recommend to check-in before getting there. Our 2 Queen bedroom was spacious and well maintained. The location is bit away from the strip so with the kids it becomes difficult to make the walk. I highly recommend to purchase the parking with the room because you can use the same to park at any MGM buildings - super value!!
40,The location great when participating in convention events.  Rooms nice and clean. Charge for storing personal items in the refrigerator no complementary coffee in the room. Convenient mobile check in and check out.
50,If your going ro a Raider game this was perfect! Restaurants were yummy! Both my boys had their first time in Vegas and had a blast! Room service was great! My knee has not been it’s best and they had a wheelchair for me writhing minutes! It was perfect!
50,Mandalay Bay you never disappoint!! Thank you for your absolutely wonderful everything. My fiancé and I had an amazing time with all that is offered at your Resort. We will definitely be back in the summertime.
30,We were in town for a quick holiday getaway and Raider game over Christmas weekend. The hotel is very convenient for walking to the game. The room was comfy hot water was great but carpet/upholstery smelled a little old. My husband's nose would immediate get stuffy and he sneezed every time we reentered the room after being out. I was a bit disappointed in not being able to make a cup of coffee or store my personal beverages in the fridge without being charged a fee. The gym didn't have water in the dispenser or disinfecting spray or wipes for the equipment. But there were plenty of masks and hand sanitizing stations in the common areas of the hotel and security officers to remind you to mask up.
50,Best value and service! Room was clean with very nice decor! Wonderful modern bathroom! Stay Well floor 59 is very good - had air purifier aromatherapy diffuser vitamin C shower supplement. Front desk staff is friendly accommodating and helpful! Parking is easily accessible and not crowded.
10,No hot water and no water pressure in the shower. No one come and fix it luckily I only stay for 2 nights. Kept calling front desk and they kept saying they will send someone to fix it. Not sure if MGM will sell this property but their maintenance of it looks like they are.
50,We had a great time and would recommend this resort/casino to everyone. The room was clean and welcoming. The service and amenities were wonderful. They make everything from parking and check-in to check-out and departure easy.
30,We stayed at Mandalay Bay to celebrate the Christmas weekend. Upon checking in the mobile room key didnt work at all. We had to get back down stairs to get the physical key card. Also no room cleaning were provided for our 3-nights stay here-although I have seen the cleaning cart in the hall way while leaving and coming back to my room. Overall not the Vegas experience that I would have expected
40,Stayed to watch the raiders game . Great beds. Comps were good. Disappointed in the 25 $ min black jack tables . Food choices were ok. Hot tub was closed . Overall good rating. And would stay again . .
40,at checkout I was informed that there was a charge for me putting my water from downstairs in the fridge in my room... didn't use anything just put my water in the fridge... explaned that to the clerk at checkput and she wasn't very accommodating... left a sour taste on an almost perfect stay at this property
10,The closet has the dust for at least a month the bathtub full of the hair from the last tenant the face tub was clogged and has the throw up from the last tenant. And when I told all of these and showed all the pictures to the front desk he was so rude.
40,I would rather have an unstocked refrigerator than be charged a hold cost for incidentals. The shower faucet was broken making it hard to know which way to turn for hot or cold water. The doors to bathrooms were heavy and loud.
50,We had a great experience at the Mandalay Bay. Room was clean it was super easy to check in and out from my phone even open the gate for the parking from my phone. But my favorite thing was the real blackout curtains!!! Slept so welll!!! Definitely will be going back...
50,Safe reliable and fun! I really liked my stay here and the location is actually great because is close to highways and exits. Amazing place for those who come to Vegas to watch sports as well due to its proximity to stadiums and arenas.
40,Checked in using mobile app. I was able to use my phone as a key for the elevator but had to get a card key as it would not work on the room door.  Room is large and clean possibly the best room I have had in vegas.  No free coffee or water but it is available for in room purchase but expensive. Two serving coffee is $12 water is $10 with premium water $20.  The mini bar is expensive. No fridge or microwave.  Casino floor seems very dark. I prefer a little more light.  I will stay again just based on room size and cleanliness.  I used my mlife rewards card and got the room for free so that makes it even better
50,I always enjoy going to the Mandalay  Bay for gambling/leisure time. This trip I took my family and we stayed at the hotel. For the price it’s just hard to find anywhere this nice. Everything in the room was very clean and felt like it was all brand new down to the bathroom fixtures. Our room had a great view with floor to ceiling windows. The kids loved it. The beds were really comfortable. The staff was very friendly. The ability to self check in and deal with parking through the app is a big plus.
30,No fridge to store leftover food from eating out or chill personal drink. No Microwave to reheat food in room or in any central place. No hand cream/lotions in the bathroom with heating on hands aware getting extremely dry.  Not recommended for families with kids. No place for storing even little extra foods for kids.
10,"Don't stay at Raider Nation clubhouse unless you're a card carrying member.  Bes were filty and staff was in competent. Only positive was VIP service and Wolfe's Lupo restaurant and leaving without getting in a fight with a Raider ""fan""."
20,They do not do housekeeping well. We stayed there for four days and they didn’t change the bed sheets and towels even though we asked them too. also the room was not cleaned well and they don’t refill thr toiletries as well. When you call the front desk to ask for refills it will take forever.. too disappointing.
50,Whenever we travel to Vegas from Texas we stay at Mandalay Bay. The food options are great people are nice and always take care of the customer. Rooms are clean and hotel doesn't smell like smoke and Marajuana.
30,The property has aged so much. The rooms are not as nice. It took forever to get hot water in our room. The service lacks the sparkle. The bar staff are rude to you. Check in staff are the best part of it.
20,Loud crackling noise coming from room that did not stop the entire night. Was forced to play music all night in order to drown out the crackling sound.  Unable to get a good nights sleep. Advised staff but they were not helpful in fixing the problem or even trying to determine the problem.
20,During our stay the fire alarm went off on our floor. When I went to take a look into the hallway it was filled with smoke and smelled horrible. We were told to remain in our room but too much smoke was entering the room and I was becoming nausea I did not feel safe and since the elevators were still fully functional we decided to head down to the casino floor. Which seemed like the logical thing to do with so much smoke filling the hallway and room. When I went to find out more information I was told several different stories as to why the alarm went off and reason for so much smoke. None of which made since. One of them being that someone was smoking a cigarette near a fire alarm. I really felt like no one cared to find the correct answer and just wanted me to accept whatever answer they could come up with to get rid of me. Even after complaining about the unbearable smell of the smoke I was never offered to be moved to another room. I have always enjoyed staying and playing at the Mandalay Bay Resort but my last several stays have had some type of inconvenience met with little help. I have stayed at several MGM Resorts and I feel like this is becoming the new normal for your resort chain. I visit Las Vegas often and have experienced far better service and attention from the other resort.
10,Check in self on smart Phone.    The cleaning lady Filipino Lady come to my room December 26 open the door. With out Knocking I just go out the shower. Happen again!!!  I’m check out December 27.. I have not checking out yet she open the door 9:00 am with out knocking. I told her I will check out very soon 9:30.    1. No Free water No free coffee    When out to buy
30,Hello. It is a nice hotel but for the price I expected better. We stayed three nights. Toilet paper and toiletries were ruff and cheap. We now know that every room has a minibar with a weighted refrigerator and tray were every time you moved anything you get charged for it. $12 cup of coffee & $10 bottle water. If you want to store your own drinks/food in the refrigerator you will be charged $50 for it. Nothing is complementary you will be charged for everything. I Was also charged $44+ per night for resort fees (use of amenities such as pool gym wifi) even though the pool & Gym were closed by the time we stayed. I was able to lower the resort fees and paid for one night only. I still believe they could off waived them fees. Also Keep in mind that the hotel is dog friendly (We didn't know at the time) and we couldn't sleep for two nights due to some dog barking all night. I will definitely not recommend this hotel if you don't want to find yourself with an unexpected extensive and overpriced bill at checkout.
10,The facilities were nice. The hotel/resort staff were not so friendly. The House of Blues staff were phenomenal. For some reason the pools were all closed. The staff mentioned that only one pool was opened but every time we tried to access the pool we were told it was closed.
50,It’s always a great experience at. Mandalay Bay. They go the extra mile to help with everything. The casino is always clean the restaurants are great and it’s so close to the Raiders stadium. Makes for a great Raiders weekend!
50,My wife and I decided to spend Christmas in Las Vegas and as Mandalay Bay is one of our preferred hotels we decided to spend the holiday here. The staff at the VIP Lounge Hennessey and MJ were both great Hennessey especially so as she ensured we were as happy as possible. Though a short stay our Presidential Suite was simply stunning. 2 stories a head on Strip View with decor unique to this suite. I wish I remembered to ask who was the interior designer I want to hire them for our new house.    We had fun at Shark Reef and really enjoyed several drinks along with some great music at Hazel Cocktail Bar. The performer Jonny Hazard was extremely engaging and talented. We were only going to stay for one set we ended up staying for his last three. I hope the next time we visit he is performing.    Room service food which we had for dinner (classic table service) and breakfast (quick) were actually good. My berry and nut parfait was the best I've ever had. My only criticism would be the fact that room service isn't 24 hours and you have to spend $100 plus delivery fee and tax to order the classic. If a hotel has a butler team it should offer 24/7/365 room service for it's guests.    Was really happy with our stay and will be returning as guests. Only other piece of advice for the hotel is to offer a few types of pillows. The ones here don't provide as much support as I like. However next time I'll simply bring my own.    Thanks for the great stay!
30,When I arrived at my room with a sandwich and potatoes left over from lunch I was shocked that there was no refrigerator to keep them or microwave to reheat them. I did not play to eat every meal at a restaurant for my 4-day stay but that's what I had to do. Had I known this I would not have stayed at the Mandalay Bay. Fortunately there was a McDonald's across the street where I had two breakfasts. Every meal purchased at the hotel was $20-30 just for me.
30,Great location if you're going to Allegiant but the resort is showing its age. Room decor is tired and too drab and dark. And very frustrating is how they promote and want you to use their digital key on the app but it doesn't work in the elevators to provide access to your floor...so you need to get a physical card key. Saw at least 5 people during our stay that had this same stress-inducing experience.
50,Great hotel nice size rooms with tub and shower separate I had a nice room window view to the strip and very laid back casino not to busy the price was great I used through a booking service check in was in and out quick.
10,"Facilities and rooms were very nice staff wash very friendly and helpful. However guests who happen to need to park must pay $15 per day unless they are ""premier"" players. Rooms have mini-fridge ($10-12 for soda or water)...even to just use the fridge for keeping your own things cool is a $50 charge. Late check-out yup you guessed it no problem for a small fee. There are several Vegas Strip resorts and most all downtown hotels that don't do this."
50,The service quality of food and rooms at Mandalay Bay aren't done justice online. From the moment we walked through the doors we were greeted by friendly and professional staff who offered suggestions on restaurants and shows.
30,If you are looking for good Las Vegas experience go somewhere else. Generally the hotel has No service requested a mini-refrigerator but never got delivered. TV had no cable service. Charged for the item never touched/saw from mini-bar. The mini-bar is a trap if you don’t need it stay away from it. You touch it you pay sometime you don’t touch it you still have to pay. Don’t do online checkout review the bill before you leave the property.
30,Room itself was good but had loud talking neighbors that woke up our baby a couple times. My wife and I couldn’t sleep either. The walls in between walls seem to be very thin. Tried to call guest services but no one picked up for 30 minutes (!) so I had to head to the front desk and request security to quiet down our neighbors. They eventually left the room for a while but then came back two hours later and woke me up again for a bit. Frustrating night of sleep for me.
10,no room clean and we need ask ask ask still no house keeping service finnaly we go front desk ask then got the room clean it's realy bad service and Seems to discriminate against Asians  we never stay hotel at las vegas like this !!
30,Disappointed in surprise charges for water and coffee. Should be better explanation of what is considered mini bar. Location was good since we booked the MJ One show which was great. Casino was fun. Great band at one of the bars. Room could of been cleaner
30,Not bad not the best. Comped is the way to Go if your going to stay here. It’s just to far from everything you want to see. Unless you wanna stay around MB Luxor excalibur and NYNY. Strip steak was pretty good too tho.
10,No help from security or front desk to resolve this issue. $30/day for parking and our vehicle is broken into causing thousands of dollars in loss & damage to vehicle. Still have not heard back from any Mandalay representatives after filing the report. Absolute worst experience I have ever had. I expected better from this establishment. Very disappointed.
10,Reception.was rude and made me feel guilty about bringing my dog. I paid for her stay and signed a waiver but they insisted on going through their rules. Very small turf patch for dog relief! How silly to call your hotel a dog friendly hotel and have such a small dog relief area???????? What about big dogs?
10,Booked a room selected 2 queens. Day before arrival did pre check in. Day of check in did mobile check in for late arrival at 10 am. From 10am till my anticipated arrival 1130pm they should've been able to provide the room I selected with advance check in and advanced pre check in via app. Arrived the digital room key did not work on one side of the elevator scanner but worked on the other side. The room door sensor did not open with mobile key. Had to walk back down and look for where to make mobile keys. The check in line was about 20 deep. No clear area or signs showing where to make keys. Finally after walking around the mobile check in desk with no one there and the front desk with lots of guests there. Found an area that had 2 machines to print keys. If a hotel can't give the room type I booked I would've went to another hotel that could. Bait and switching without informing the customer of the change and let them arrive in the room and find out.
50,"My husband and I spent his birthday in Vegas. We had never stayed at Mandalay Bay and thought - ""What the heck!"" Boy are we glad we did! What great service! We experienced friendly prompt and excellent service everywhere we went in the resort! We ade excited to go back!!"
20,Did not like my stay at all. Before booking I requested a high floor with strip. Waited 30 min besides we arrived after 3pm. Room was not ready. Asked how long it takes to wait nobody knows it. Asked to give me a high floor and strip but got 11 floor with airport watching))) Mattresses was bad. Me and my kid had very bad back issues after sleep on that low grade mattress.
50,Recently stayed at MBay for a night on a Christmas season trip. Awesome staff clean comfy room easy access and getting around. Stay here if you can. You will be pleasantly satisfied with your stay.
50,this place was amazing all the restaurants were on point.the best place for us was easily the Foundation room best food I ever ate and the staff was great bonus was the amazing views and the bar was a great place to relax great atmosphere
50,First time ever writing a review but compelled on Christmas to thank Mandalay Bay for years of Christmas (and other) stays. I just love this hotel - from the rooms to the gym/spa to the fabulous places to eat. Started coming here 20 some years ago and never stay anywhere else. Staff has always been great. Rooms have always been clean and spacious (upgraded this year to an amazing Penthouse!) Truth be told I call it my happy place. Thank you Mandalay Bay.
10,Check-in process was a disaster…had the app with my virtual key ready so tried to go straight to the room. Virtual key wouldn’t work in the elevator so I went back to the lobby for a physical key. Go to my room and there’s no hot water. Switch rooms my virtual card doesn’t work in the elevator so I go to the lobby yet again for physical keys. Head back up to my room and can’t get hot water. Then didn’t get any housekeeping the 3 nights we were there. No beds made no new towels no trash taken out. We called the front on two different days and couldn’t get an answer. Terrible
40,Great hotel for family fun. Not in the busy strip but well connected and walkable distance. Lots of good eateries at the shops also connected to the hotel. Very peaceful and my kids enjoyed the pool area too.
40,Was a great place to stay! Only problem was the bath tub in our room wasn’t clean and had all dirt around it. Could scratch it off with a tissue overall stay was great check in was super easy did it through the mgm app and got room keys through self service tablet. Really great check in system!
30,We stayed here for 5 days for my son's USOpen table tennis tournament. We weren't able to sleep thru the night as loud music from neighboring room was on all night imagine sleeping thru this mess. No help from staff to correct the situation instead asked us to move to a different room at 2AM.
50,Mandalay Bay was very accomadating. Nice rooms clean environment given the circumstances friendly staff. Check in Check out very fast but mobile check in did not work. Stripsteak was outstanding the coffee shop was very good. Gym was adequate.
50,Still one of the great casinos on the strip. Beautiful interior decor. Comfortable bed. Nice tub and shower. Clean room. Friendly staff. Dog friendly hotel. Nice assortment of slots. Great room service food.
30,Good choices of food and good location for the show we were seeing at MGM Park. Prices for rooms were reasonable. Unfortunately the check in was not friendly and somewhat rude. They were not busy so there was no reason for the attitude!
50,Time of year was really nice it was fairly empty. Hotel was decorated nicely. Recommend using the MGM app made check in super convenient. We dined at stripsteak and Lupo both very delicious and great customer service. Also watched Michael Jackson show also highly recommend. Citizen was a great place for breakfast. Hotel was clean and staff was great.
30,Very beautiful hotel. Amazing views and features. Our whole experience was ruined after hotel staff was insensitive to our needs during a special situation. It was pretty much made out that we were inconveniencing them and wasting our time. A lot of unneeded stress could have been avoided if listed too instead of acting like we are the problem for their buildings malfunction.
20,Although the property was gorgeous there were several things below expectations. The price on pre-booking is essentially half of what you’ll end up paying because they exclude “local” and “resort” fees that’s essentially doubled the cost of the overall stay once you arrive for check-in (so save extra!). For its high acclaim I felt I was staying in a 1-2 star hotel. To start the ice machine was broke and there is no mini fridge to store your food/beverages without incurring a cost. Then once I reported it it took several days to get fixed. Leading into overall customer satisfaction the cleaning staff was the only “positive” of the trip. They were extremely friendly. However the casino staff seemed selective in their decision to offer free drinks. My fiancé and I are excellent tippers and were looking forward to the opportunity to reward the serving staff but they were focused on different ethnic and financially-appearing customers. Everything was egregiously priced (mini-bar restaurants within Mandalay and anything you needed besides the water to come out of the faucets) and would not recommend to anyone. Fremont area is a way better experience. The Mandalay is furthest away from The Strip and requires Ubers every time because we wanted to dress nice and not walk a round-trip 2-2.5 miles just to get to and from the strip especially with my fiancé’s love of wearing heels. Save your money time and expectations and treat yourself to a different hotel or area where you’ll be taking Ubers/taxis anyways.
10,Not only did the staff mess up my reservation but refused to fix it. Did not have my reservation I had booked months in advance and then told me they were doing me a favor for allowing me to check into my reservation and made me pay for 2 nights when I only stayed 1. Service was terrible staff was rude and unhelpful. Food was bad and prices for almost anything was ridiculous $10 for a CAN of Pepsi
40,This was our 1st stay at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas. The purpose was to play in the US Open at the MB Convention Center. The property was much bigger in size and scope than expected. But all in all it was a comfortable relaxing and enjoyable stay after four days of fierce competitive play.
50,Rooms were gorgeous and spacious were awesome views! I would say that the only thing that was an issue was the walls can be thing and you here everything that happens in the halls and adjoining rooms.
50,Had a great time. Went for daughters birthday. She’s 14 and we saw the cirque show “one” everything was completely family friendly. She had the time of her life. We have stayed here before but never with our daughter. She will be with us next time too.
50,Very clean! The best rooms! Staff is very friendly too! I’d highly recommend! Love the pools! Just overall one of the best places to stay in Vegas! I’d highly recommend Mandalay Bay to all of my friends and Family thank you!
50,Was my first time at mandlay bay and i was very pleased with all the listed above but the service was what stands out above everything else without a doubt. I also would have to say the sports book lounge was my personal favorite compared to other locations
50,This property is a wonderful place to stay. Our one bedroom penthouse room was clean spacious with a great view. Great overall experience. The food was wonderful friendly staff easy access to other properties with the Express Tram. Also quick check in. No issue at all.
50,Great experience for family relaxation. Nice pools and the food is really good. Not super super crowded like some of the other hotels which is kind of nice. Good service at front desk and all that good stuff.
50,Checkin was fast and easy. Great front desk staff. Clean room with a great view  from the 60th floor. Fully stocked mini bar  bathtub and a shower. Toilet is separated and has a door for privacy. Toiletries were available and plenty of clean towels facecloths and hand towels.
20,rooms not cleaned. we also found hair in the bath tub and old coffee pod and no shampoo or conditioner or soap.maid walked in on us twice! We were very unhappy with this experience i did like the heater not making any noise.
20,Priority Check in area poor customer service. Had noise issue because of the connected room. Hence in the morning asked for room change at priority check in area on 12/19/2021 @9.30 am. After that couple of times was asked check back. Then finally was told someone will call back. No body called in 20 hr period. Checked out of the room two days earlier to my original checkout. Ms. Ramirez was nice and mentioned that other manager closed the issue as resolved when no one contacted me as a guest at the hotel.
50,I love the mandalay Bay . It is one of my favorite Hotels. I highly reccomend them year around. There is some construction going on so the food court is difficult to find and it would have been nice to put hours on the signs instead of walking the detour just to find out they closed . other than that it was a blast
20,Walls are just too thin. I was staying in hotel with my 13yr old son for an event. Couple next door had their private moment and it was so embarrassing. Could hear everything it was a TVMA without visuals.    I know Mandalay bay will not change wall or soundproof the connecting door between the room hope they come up atleast placing guests appropriately
20,Broken TVs in Media Suites and useless Sidewalk in Parking garage scraped my MB CLS bumper    Broken TVs in Media Suites and a useless Sidewalk in Parking garage scraped my MB CLS bumper. Idk even what’s the use of that elevated platform. There’s no foot traffic in that area and there’s soda/beer/pee marks/stains.
50,apparently this review needs to be more than 199 words. that is fine. the stay here is amazing so alot to say but not enough time. I can say overall my stay is great and I did not want leave the bed. it was so comfy.
30,I had great expectations but left disappointed. My assigned room was not cleaned when I opened the door. I had to drag my luggage all the way back to check-in in order to be assigned another room. The buffet was never open. In fact there were very few of the many restaurants open during my stay. I refuse to play 6:5 BlackJack and the 3:2 tables were $25+ per hand. Even those tables closed at 2:00am and then we were left with only 6:5 tables open. The food court is in the building but it is at least a quarter of a mile away from the elevators to the rooms. So by the time you get your fast food back to your room it is already cold. BTW...there was only on place in the food court open Subway. The other 5-6 were closed. I would not suggest Mandalay Bay at this point. There are better choices in Vegas.
50,A very comfortable and satisfying experience. We had stayed another property and was terribly disappointed with the abrupt rushed sense of service as if to just get us out of the way. Questions were answered with a very “as a matter of fact it is what it is” attitude. COVID has clearly become a terribly abused excuse. Then there is Mandalay..great service from everyone. Friendly professional courteous and appreciative team at every turn. CLEAN COMFORTABLE AND SAFE I am truly grateful
10,From start to finish our trip was a disaster. We booked 2 penthouse sky suites for our 15th wedding wedding anniversary only to find out that our suites we’re going to be under construction the day we arrived. They then moved us to a handicapped suite with bathrooms that were a travesty. We requested to be moved to a different room and then they moved us to a suite in Delano. We packed up our belongings and walked all the way to the other hotel. Upon arriving at the Delano front desk they told us the manager no longer wanted to give us the suites he told us and to walk back to Mandalay Bay. When we return back to Mandalay Bay they told us the only rooms they could give us was a conference suite and the media suite. So instead of the romantic penthouse suite and we booked we were stuck down on the 25th floor in a room designed to hold conferences. It took 6 1/2 hours from when we arrived at 1:30 to actually get into the hotel room that they gave us. We missed our dinner reservations and barely made it to the Michael Jackson show which was in the Mandalay Bay. I booked the VIP arrival experience as well we were told that we would be picked up in a limo and were picked up in an SUV. The VIP check-in staff treated us as if we were interrupting on their day and making a big deal about nothing. Our media suite has stopped up drains with gray water in them and our steam shower panel was totally ripped apart with exposed wires and one side of our drapery would not open so we could only see half of our view. Our floor must’ve flooded because there was a tornado style fan blowing at our door 24 hours a day for our entire trip. We also in experienced a wind storm and all of the window vents in our place were broken and the wind sounds like a jet airplane blowing through our suite. The only way we can get the wind sound to lessen was to the stack furniture on the slats pushing them closed. We requested our limo to pick us up for the airport at 11 o’clock we confirmed it with concierge’s and of course the limo did not show up till almost 1130. We were supposed to stay on the same floor as our daughter but the only room they would give her was three floors above. I can only say that our trip was nearly ruined and we will not be returning to Mandalay Bay.
40,My stay overall was wonderful. Only complaint that I have is that I am a platinum mlife member yet they would not waive my resort fees which I couldn’t believe. I don’t like confrontation so I didn’t push the issue. But for that reason alone I will do future business trips with a different hotel
30,Rented Reef Suite plus 8 Elite King rooms for 3-4 days for our wedding and guests. Rooms were great. However our planned wedding reception in our suite was negatively affected when our computer could not connect with HDMI to the large screen TV in order to share specially selected music and videos. Repeated calls for technical assistance resulted in promises to send a technical expert immediately but no one ever came. And then we needed to leave for our wedding. In the reception back in our suite we had to watch our first dance music video on a laptop. We could not play the carefully selected videos and music on the large screen. Instead we looked for music on YouTube - muting adds. This was not our plan.
20,The hotel room was fine bed was nice great shower but I will not be staying at MandaIay Bay again due to the Front Desk employees handling of erroneous Mini Bar Room Charges.    On Saturday my wife and I looked at our room charges on the Room TV. We noticed that we were charged two charges for the something that perhaps was for the Mini Bar for $12 each. I called the Front Desk to find out what it was since my my wife and I did not consume anything from the mini bar and the front desk told me it was for 2 coffees that were in plastic shrink wrap next to 4 waters  next to a Keurig type single coffee maker...When I mentioned that my wife picked one up and was looking for a price...then we realized there was a sign to check on the TV for pricing of water and coffee. When we saw it was $12 for a coffee we didn't consume the shrink wrapped in plastic coffees. I explained this to the employee and she said that they would remove the charge...but they said you should have placed the item back as it was if you didn't want it. We told them that's what we did and her comments were very flippant.    Upon getting ready to checkout on Sunday morning I saw the two $12 charges were on the bill still. I was not happy. I went to the Front Desk to state what happened and the employee at the front desk told me that I should have seen a small sign that the mini bar was weighted. I said there wasn't a sign about weighted mini bar for the water or coffee...there was a sign about checking the price on the TV...She insisted it was there and I'm telling y'all it's not there. I feel that the Front Desk employees need to visit the rooms again to see this...    So you want to charge me $15 to self park fine...You want to charge me $39 Resort Fee plus tax in the winter when there aren't any pools open...sure whatevs that's what the Strip casinos do...    But you want to charge me $12 for a cup of coffee in the room that my wife and I didn't consume just because it was picked up and then since the sign to find out about the price was on the waters...that said to check the TV and then talk to me like I'm a criminal for trying to pull one over on the hotel...you can go jump in your Shark Tank Mandalay. It was unprofessional and my business will go elsewhere.    Caveat emptor y'all.
50,We love the Mandalay Bay. Great resort awesome pools and lazy River many different dining options. Staff is always friendly and helpful. Favorite place for breakfast is at the RiRa it’s also great for drinks and live music at night.
40,Mandalay is always a choice for us. It never disappoints us. However the airport plane engine noise did bother me a little. Maybe it's the room location. In addition the spa time was too short from 9-2pm. Other resorts like Aria had the regular schedule. Wish Mandalay had a longer spa hours.
30,The app for check in did not work so don't waste your time. Our room was beautiful but we were skipped by housekeeping 4 days in a row and ran out of towels TP ect. and had to request it be brought up. Our room was not cleaned even on request. Not exactly a luxury getaway. Also plan ahead for food in the late evening we could not find anything tasty to eat late at night. Make sure to pack good shoes because you will be doing A LOT of walking with the hotel being at the end of the strip. A positive was the shark reef it is beautiful!
40,If you like fine dining and a lot of gaming options this casino/resort is for you. My only recommendation for the resort is to make sure the rooms are thoroughly cleaned before making them available to guests.
50,We stayed at the Mandalay Bay whilst we attended a Military Ball. Our room was on the 25th floor which we had a great view the bed was really comfy and the room was really nicely designed. I loved the big bathtub and the shower was great. The lights in the mirror worked great for putting on makeup with the additional small mirror on the side for closeups. We would definitely stay again.
50,We stayed here during the NFR and the hotel room was a nice size for us. We enjoyed the stay and any issue we had was resolved quickly. I do think the coffee should be free in the room like chain motels :)
30,My recent trip to Mandalay Bay lasted two days and that was about as much as I could take. For the price of the rooms the quality is extremely underwhelming.    We asked check-in how to find the self parking lot. We were told to use a GPS.    The bathroom toilet was small and dirty. The shower floor looked like it hadn't been scrubbed in a year at least.    We tried to order room service and - after waiting on the line for almost 30 minutes - I was able to place an order for chicken strips and fries. The chicken strips tasted like Tyson popped in a microwave for 30 seconds. The meal and two drinks cost me $74.    The second day we had to use the bathroom towels we left on the floor because house cleaning never came to our room.    I should've stayed at another cheaper hotel where I would have gotten better quality.
40,The room was clean and comfortable. I was disappointed that we could not use the refrigerator in the room without paying a $55.00 fee the coffee in the room is also $10.00 per cup. Aside from that the stay was great!
40,We came with our twin 16 year olds for the National Finals Rodeo and had a fantastic trip. The lobby was decorated for Christmas and looked very grand. The room we stayed in bathroom and linens were clean but the room needed a couple of adjustments. For instance the bathroom door would not shut all the way and the luggage rack was broken. The hair dryer was also broken upon use. I gave them a call and had a brand new one within 15 minutes. The one thing you will need to pay attention to is the snacks and drinks in the room. The items are weighted and when lifted you are automatically charged. My kids each picked up a bottle of water and we asked them to put it back because we didn't need to pay for an expensive bottle of water. We were fortunate to check our bill the day before our departure and noticed we had 2 $20 bills for the snack bar but hadn't taken anything. We called in and had someone take inventory of our stock and we were credited back that day. The bottles of water were $20 each! So beware! For those wanting to check out the sites and walk around there is a monorail available in the lobby area that leads to the Excalibur Hotel. Just wish it went all around the area. All in all we were happy with our room and in awe of our view from the room stating we would stay again.
20,They state at the front desk “The room you book is an approximate of what you get” I paid extra for a stay well king and got a low floor double Queen. In 5 days I was never moved. This hotel is far from everything entertaining. Do not even waste your money.
40,Room was nice. Nice location because you can get to places to eat off the strip easily. Only down side was that the rooms have a refrigerator that is a mini bar so you can’t use them which sucks especially if you’re staying for multiple days. Also parking should be free for paying guest. Valet is $26 a day and self parking I believe is $15. After resort fees and parking even if the room rates were cheap you are still going to pay a hefty price because of added fees.
50,I recommend Mandalay Bay to any one the wants to other things in Vegas besides going on the strip and being in casinos the whole time because it's right next to the highway for fast traveling and has excellent service and not as busy of a casino as others on the strip and is overall a more laid back casino over others!
40,We had a great stay. We paid for early check-in and were not able to check in early. The money was refunded and we ended up in a two queen room rather than one king booked.Overall it was a great trip!
10,Room did not have the towels and supplies needed for the room. Had to call to get towels. Then after jumping into shower found the floor had black scum between tiles! Hope I do not get any disease from this encounter. Very surprise to see this hotel have such poor room quality. Yes I have pictures...
40,Don’t lose your valet ticket on a rental car. They will treat you like u stole the vehicle. Fekade did not have very good customer service skills. After an hr of back and forth we finally were able to get our rental car.  car.
30,We left an item in the room and it was such a pain to get it back. We had to return three separated to retrieve it. Tried calling the lost and found two times but they just have you on hold for hours. Our stay was just ok. We had a much better stay and time at the MGM.
50,The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are first rate. We had excellent five star food at each venue during our trip. The electronic check-in/out was a breeze. The machines and tables in the casino are nicely spaced for Covid safety. Indoor walkways to Luxor and Excalibur make it a breeze to get around and fun!
10,Guest services was extremely rude for no reason. Some lights in the room didn’t work. Online check in through the app doesn’t work. Room service was overpriced and some items were disgusting - jail food almost others were decent. Too much of a hassle for me would rather stay elsewhere on the strip.
50,I brought my mom to stay at Mandalay Bay as a Christmas present. It was amazing! The room was beautiful the staff was so friendly the Valets were awesome. I will definitely be recommending the Mandalay Bay to anyone who want to get away and relax. Great experience all around!
50,We love Mandalay Bay Resort because everything is first class; from the check in the room service and the facilities. My wife love playing and I enjoy the shows and the food. This time we even have help from Mike in maintenance who was amazing helping us.
40,Usually the Coffee in the room is free and you can use the fridge but not at this hotel. Unfortunately even if you upgrade your room to one with a fridge in it you will be charged if you move anything out of that fridge to put your own items in with a total of $50.
30,Paid $50/night plus taxes and fees for a room upgrade. There were little things we noticed each day with the room that were off (water stains and cracks on ceiling towel bar over tub fell off one night tub full of dust - noticed after filling it and seeing a layer floating on the top before we used it magnifying mirror in bathroom had light that didn't work one of the bathroom doors (left door if looking at bathroom from bed) wouldn't always stay shut and would swing open on its own room connected to another and there was a large gap under the door - it was easy to hear other guests (full conversations) as well as had light from their room coming into ours all night each night missing gasket at top of one window panel created a cool draft near that window as well as increased noise in room water in shower was very inconsistent with temperature - would go from warm to freezing cold in about a minute without moving handle a wrapped bar of soap was under one sink against the wall and stood there even after room was cleaned). We also paid for a late check-out and got locked out of our room an hour early (with all of our things as well as our three friends' luggage locked inside). We were looking forward to relaxing in our room and enjoying the view for a bit more before traveling back home but did not get the opportunity to do so. One of our friends also had a Swiffer-type cleaner left in his bathroom that we found when he first got into his room.    We had a much different experience this stay than the first time we visited in October 2019. It was almost like being at a completely different hotel. The one plus was friendly staff (hotel casino restaurant).
50,Great staff and location. Would stay again if the price is right. Had a king room with a awesome view of the strip. Every time I needed something small like a room card charged or change to a late check out the staff was very friendly and helpful.
10,"My kids and I flew across the country and chose this hotel for the pool experience advertised on the website. Only to find out that the pool was ""closed til Spring 2022."" Then we got charged every day for resort fees. There were no amenities!!! As a mom and a paying customer I am angry and saved for this trip for months. Will never recommend this place."
40,Me and a group of friends attended the NFR and Cowboy Christmas events. We enjoyed the hotel and casino. Good location and tram access to the convention center. The bar needed more staff. The entertainment was awesome!
50,The room was great. The resort and casino was everything I expected. Service was great the food was great. I love this resort and would recommend to anyone visiting Vegas. I will definitely be staying here in the future…
40,Great Hotel.  Conference room is excellent. The breakfast and lunch in conference room was very good.  Lupa Restaurant was exceptional.  The spa service was average for the high price.  We did not feel comfortable as many people were not wearing masks.
40,"My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel. It was really nice. The food was awesome and the staff was so friendly. I really enjoyed Border Grill and Strip Steak. I will say if your are wanting a hotel within walking distance of the ""partying"" don't stay here. We took an Uber to the hotels closer to downtown and they all were walking distance from one another. I wish we had known and just stayed at a hotel down there. Mandalay bay was fun I'm not saying that. But I wish we stayed closer to the other hotel locations. Ohhhh and I almost forgot It was COLD several days/nights. It warmed up a little but I had to purchase a coat."
20,"You hear about places like Mandalay Bay and you expect them to be at least as good as a regular hotel but the Bay fails horribly. The only positive thing I can say at the ""Resort"" is that the staff is quite nice and tries but the place is setup to create problems.  Lets start with costs. This is not a cheap place to stay most of the time. Depending on whats going on in Las Vegas room rates go up to $500 a night for a regular room. So you would expect a little. What do you get overcharges on everything. That bottle of water in your room. $10. In room coffee package $5. Starbucks is 150% of what I normally pay and the restaurants are all expensive. Want a slice of pizza plain just cheese over in the food court $8. Hot dog - $7. You want a package delivered they send it to the convention center business center (which is a 10 minute walk from the lobby where you are charged for their receiving your package. My small envelope cost be more to receive then it did for the shipping. These are just the resort overcharging for everything in what I see as an attempt to get every dollar they can from you.  Then getting around the resort itself. There are no maps to various public levels so to find a restaurant a shop etc. you either have to search for it or find someone to ask directions of which can be very confusing also. There are signs but they are inconsistent in the information they give. Where you want to go will not be mentioned on a sign until you are almost there. Getting to the convention center requires you to talk to the other side of the resort go down stairs and then virtually double back. Why to force you to walk thru the casino again.  The rooms were large and the bed comfortable but you can see the wear and tear on the edges everywhere. Small things are broken and show no sign of being fixed (elevator button on my floor was out for the entire week that I was there).  The final straw was when I found out I had another charge on my credit card from them that I neither authorized nor was told about when I checked out. They just charged my card without letting me know.  Unless someone else is paying for it I will never stay here again."
30,"The Good: The Mandalay Bay is a large resort with easy access to many restaurants and bars shows a spa shopping and connected to other resorts. If you do not mind walking or a very short car ride you also have easy access to the middle of the Las Vegas strip. There is plenty to do.    The Bad: High prices for an antiquated hotel room and mediocre service. Some staff members were nice and professional and some were doing the bare minimum. It was just not what you would expect from this kind of resort. This is not my first time at this resort and the service and quality were much better in the past. We also paid for early check-in because we knew our flight was arriving early however the room was not ready until after 3pm because they were still ""cleaning it"" which brings me to...    The Ugly: The room was not clean (most noticeably in the bathroom). The towels were dirty there was hair all over the shower walls the shower itself appeared unclean and there was old crusted toothpaste on top on the sink faucets. I could just tell it was not clean and it made me question the cleanliness of the entire room. I called the hotel and the lady I spoke with apologized and said she would ""let housekeeping know"". We got more towels delivered that evening but ended up cleaning the room ourselves. Maybe my expectations were too high but I expected better from this resort at this price point.    On a side note we watched what appeared to be a fight break out in the House of Blues and a man was taken away in handcuffs. This was not the resorts fault but it did negatively effect our experience and we were concerned for our safety."
50,The hotel was absolutely fabulous. We had a view of the new Alligent Stadium. The House of Blues Shrimp Grits and Cornbread is delicious we had twice. The hotel is massive so be prepared to do a lot of walking. Overall it is worth every penny I spent.
50,Went for my friends 50th birthday stayed a couple days staff us very friendly and bellman are super friendly and fast. Clean casino and food at restaurants is great. Can't wait to book for our future birthdays for our selfs.
50,Great time at Manadaly. Awesome resort room casino and atmosphere. Loved our experience. The staff at every department was helpful friendly and professional. House of Blues was great for food drinks and fun. Definitely going back.
30,The hotel could use some improvements and updates. The gym is very sub par and they charge you FULL resort fee even when pools etc are closed and can not be utilized.  The app is terrible.  They charge $15 for self parking.
30,Consistently not provided all towels accoutrements trouble renting movies noise coming from bathroom in morning (pipes making loud noises). Staff was friendly and attempted to fix all issues. Bar staff very attentive and friendly. No Mlife card replacement machine like the NYNY had so had to wait in the cash out line which was cumbersome.
50,Rly nice clean rooms. Good service best casino I saw on the strip. Good food. Like the food court for a quick bite to eat. Only issue I had was I was unaware of the 400 deposit for the room. Didn’t see anything about it when I booked and paid for 4 night online.
50,We travel to and through Las Vegas a few times a year. Normally during NFR and then traveling up and back to Utah WY MT etc. Really like the ease of getting to the Mandalay and the parking. The extra benefits given to veterans is also very much appreciated.
10,phone and jumping through hoops to register to expedite check in which that procedure took awhile while waiting for our flight. We arrive at the hotel after a 5 hr. flight try using the app for room info and digital key yet there was none. So we had to wait in line anyway. Upon getting our room key we went up to the room and when we entered the room at 11:30pm we see that it hadn't been touched since the last guests checked out. All the lights were on in the room and we thought it was still occupied. So we head back to the front desk and were given another room on the 11th floor which was fine when we entered the room. Went to fill the ice bucket only to find the ice machine was Out of Order. So we call the front desk and they said to go to another floor for ice which is not possible for security purposes. The elevators only take you to the floor your room occupies. So they send someone to the room with ice. then we had to go back to the front desk to get a key to allow us access to another floor for working ice machine. This hotel is a joke no telling how long the ice machine's been busted and with the money this hotel brings in they could easily buy a new one. The elevator doors look trashed and one of them only worked going down after being called up from above. For what we spent and what we got I could have stayed at the Days Inn for much less money and probably a working ice machine which there is only one for each floor and there are many rooms per floor so I think the machines are over worked. We were given a $75.00 credit for the aggravation which we then used at the restaurant only to find out it hadn't been applied. So we had to call the desk again to have it applied which we were told it would be done immediately. I had always heard that Mandalay Bay was a great hotel on the strip compared to the Luxor or Excalibur. I will never stay at MB again. Perhaps MGM owns too many hotels that doesn't allow them to manage them well. Too much money for crummy service but the lobby sure is nice. They also want to charge you for the in room coffee and bottled water ridiculous! Also the fridge is locked so no keeping your own bottled water cold and there is a $50 charge if you have it opened. Total money grab on everything. Makes me wonder what the resort fee covers because I don't think it covers squat! Very disappointed overall. Hotel is tired and accommodations do not meet the price point at all. Management must be asleep at the wheel or just don't care. Trip advisor has many similar situations as my own now that I have read the 1 star reviews from recent customers. Looking forward to the lame response I'll receive from the person from MGM who reads these reviews to apologize but ultimately do nothing about it Check your credit card statement to make sure they haven't added more charges as they did on mine for moving the coffee maker! It has a sensor on it even though I had no coffee there was an additional $116.29 charge. Had to make another call to MB to resolve that! MGM resorts are the worst and I've stayed in some fine hotels. Cannot stress enough how I loathe this hotel! I'd like to know what hotel the 5 star reviewers were staying at.
20,Making you pay for coffee and water in your room is not good customer service. Horribly cheap super thin tissue products in room. The toilet paper in casino was better than the rooms. I would not stay here again.
50,Clifford on front desk was polite helpful and great at his job plus hotel was clean and well maintained will come back hopefully very soon the staff made our stay very welcoming! One of my favorite hotels! Awesome job you guys.
30,The hotel is stunningly beautiful but it’s hard to breathe with the amount of smoke that is everywhere. The room had a fantastic view but there was mold and mildew in the shower and a ring in the tub. There were also several things broken in the room and the mini fridge was packed with no room for any leftovers or anything. What if I had something that I needed to keep cool like insulin or breastmilk? Not worth the money in my opinion.
20,Room key sporadically worked. The resort king package was two queen beds. The surprise fees upon arrival seems very shady. I don’t do business with folks who over promise and under deliver and that is precisely your business strategy. This is my 3rd different hotel casino to stay in Vegas and this was my least favorite. I hope you will take a closer look at what I’ve mentioned.  Room very clean loved the Blues lounge for lunch
30,they combined players club and cashier. the lone to get there is huge all the time. I stayed at the line twice x 20 mins each. Not good experience. Casino slots are tied impossible to win anything. The room was great. I went to Libertine social loved it
50,Very nice comfortable room and friendly staff! Lots of restaurants to choose from and the Casino is really nice too. The aquarium is there thats really cool. Lots to see and do there. Lots of shopping! Highly recommend!
50,Stayed for one night the property is super clean and I saw staff constantly cleaning masks and hand sanitizer stations were everywhere! Bell desk and check in staff were very friendly. Didn’t have time to go to the pool but next time we will :)
50,My fiance and I had an excellent time at Mandalay Bay. We are somewhat of travel-snobs as far as hotels go and this one did not disappoint. It was awesome to see Christmas decor everywhere! Very clean throughout comfortable beds with many different dining options. Ri Ra Irish Pub makes the best Irish stew. Bavette's Steakhouse had a nice romantic ambiance with killer crab cakes and an impressive wine list. Just book you won't be disappointed.
50,Excellent stay at Mandalay Bay. Like the property for the room layout (great bathrooms) pools (when in season) and the awesome restaurant choices. Love the Border Grille! Table dealers were very friendly and helpful. Easy access to other attractions via the tram.
30,you pay a premium to stay at these resorts (resort fee. You would expect a heated pool or jacuzzi nope! Thin staffed as well and it showed. There are other resorts that have Jacuzzis and heated pools rather stay there.
30,"Mandalay Bay used to be a top notch resort that gave you more than you paid for by Vegas standards. Now the minimum table stakes are unreasonably high as if MGM wants to earn back from their newest customers everything they lost (say they lost) in the pandemic. And we had clogged sinks and hours with no water at all from the hot faucet only to be told ""everyone is taking a shower"". Insulting."
40,The check in was difficult to find from self parking and is a 15 min walk to the front desk to check in. Should have used valet but I had already prepaid for parking. Room was not really clean and there were issues with the lams and in room coffee is not free.
30,Manager was rude and short. Had no time to listen to our request for our elderly parents to be on the same floor as us.... We help with the return and exit of them. One of our parents was not feeling well and we wanted to be close to them for any assistance needed. Please take a look at your valet parking. Lack of staff at the facility and retrieval of our SUV daily was a big challenge and confusing.
50,Everything was clean and the staff was very friendly. The bed was a dream!!  Went with family and friends and everything was perfect.  I would recommend this hotel for anyone’s future stay.  The people were very friendly and went above and beyond.
20,Could not use the refrigerator for personal use room service 24/7 would be nice in Vegas!! Hanging mirror in bathroom falling off only 2 towels no hand towels or wash cloths. Extremely loud neighbors having loud sex all night security kicking on another neighbors door to deal with a domestic incident at 2a!
50,My stay was seamless and fabulous. Traveled alone for my first time to Vegas and I felt very safe! Gorgeous property. Even though this hotel is at the end of the strip I could walk between hotels inside or take a quick ride on the tram.
50,The absolute best service privacy and luxury for your dollar but they're staying for a weekend cannot suggest any property more than Mandalay Bay. Everything in this huge Resort just comfy cozy and homey with all the Elegance of a five star resort
50,Had a blast and everything was first class! From check in to check out and everything in between Mandalay Bay was amazing. One thing that really made me happy was the service first class! I’ll be back 😄
10,Waited an hour only to be given a room I did not reserve. Promised beverage credit for inconvenience (never received). Customer service line never worked (3 days). One location during a national event lasting over a week broadcasting the show.
20,Not a clean room upon check-in. 2 towels in the room. Called to request wash cloth and hand towels. Cleaning staff eventually brought towels. Handed them to me without a word and stood there expecting a tip. A location that charges a large resort fee parking fees and $20 for 2 espressos you would think they would provide a wash cloth without having to request one. Check-in personal we’re unable to preform the simplest task of extending my stay by one night. Restaurants were closed. The tram connecting Mandalay Bay with the Luxor only runs on the weekend. All of this was during the NFR. If this is the kind of service during a large event I can’t imagine what it is like during other times. I have watched a steady decline in quality and service at this resort and others owned by this group. I will not stay at any of these hotels again.
30,Everything in this hotel is so overpriced I think due to them trying to regain their loss during Covid. Our room was clean and the bed was nice but that was it. I had several questions about my MLife points but didn’t have an opportunity to ask since everyone was so focused on moving to the next customer.
40,The room view was wonderful. If my bathroom was have been clean it would have been an excellent experience. It was the best choice if you want to go to Allegiant stadium. The view on the strip was spectacular
50,The room was immaculate my view of the strip was jaw dropping. Everything is close by. It's great having the House of Blues and Raiders stadium easy to walk to. Check-in was quick. Can't wait to stay again!
20,Wow. We’ve stayed here before and can’t believe how disappointing this trip has been. We checked in and 30 minutes later when we were sleeping a test fire alarm went off and hotel staff came into our room saying they needed to check the alarms. Another 30 minutes went by and we called to find out when it would stop and were told it would be another 2 hours!!! We were offered a room change if we wanted but they didn’t have any king beds available. I said that wasn’t really acceptable and was told I could call back in 20 minutes and check if there were any. So our options were to sit in a room for 20 mins with an alarm going off? So unprofessional.  Got to our new room and the shower was dirty with hair all over the floor and the shower handle coming off the wall. Then when we actually went to use it there was NO WATER PRESSURE. We called down and were told too many people were showering so it tripped some safety alarm but it should be working again in 30 minutes.  We tried to talk to the front desk about our issues and were offered $80 in resort credit and $30 in food credit after two attempts at talking with staff. Side note when we tried to use the food credit we were told we’d have to take our receipt to the front desk because there was an issue with charging to our room. Did that and was told by the front desk the restaurant would have had to call at the time so it didn’t work. Overall we’re spending over $1200 for this weekend and were told that they couldn’t do anything more for us bc we were already ‘over compensated’. Wow who says that in the service industry.
50,The hotel is modern clean well-appointed and has a fantastic array of restaurants! It is a great option for everyone— solo travelers couples families business travelers. It is also a great choice if you’ll have a car…you don’t have to navigate much of the traffic on the Strip it is super convenient to I-15 and the airport and has ample parking as well as an efficient valet service.
50,After a bad experience at another hotel Mandalay Bay switched our reservation and had us in a beautiful room within an hour! The front desk staff was very helpful and made you feel like a valued customer! The hotel was clean and bright. The rooms were spacious and clean as well. We'd definitely stay here again!
30,Between having to walk a mile just to get to the Uber pick up and drop off to the hotel rooms being mediocre and getting charged for what it seems like touching anything in the room… not worth it. Go to Tuscany.
10,I don’t even know where to begin. I’m usually not one to complain but WOW this has been an absolutely horrendous stay and it’s only day one 🙃  We arrived at 2am Thursday night. We had booked a king room and received a double when we called they said to call back in the morning and they would get us a king. No biggie. I call Friday morning the man I spoke with on the phone was extremely unprofessional. First he said “you need to read the fine print you were never guaranteed a king room we have none. we are booked. I explained I was told too call and he said “well I’m not moving you” I explained that we would at least like to switch rooms because our sink made a noise and kept us up all night. He said “no I will send maintenance up” I said that’s fine. we waited 2 hours for maintenance who never showed up.. I also mentioned my husband was trying to work and the wifi wasn’t working properly and this man had the audacity to say “that sounds like a personal problem….” <I was absolutely speechless. I ended up hanging out after this conversation continued this way. We had friends check in Friday who received a king bed after we were told they had none….    Later in the evening I went back to the front desk to explain the situation and the lady was great she was able to find a kind room “surprisingly” she said “you’re so lucky we even upgraded you to a strip i was beyond appreciative.    Fast forward a few hours I was in my friends room and she went to lay in bed and the sheets were absolutely DISGUSTING!! <pictured included. We call housekeeping 45 minutes later no one was there this was 11:30 pm. At 12:20 someone finally comes to change the sheets and even he was appalled. He went to change the sheets and said “oh no these ones are dirty also let me get you new ones” then profusely apologized. I asked if they were busy tonight and he said “oh no not at all.” I told him it took 45 minutes and he said they just told him to come and that their is no reason it should have taken that long.    If this hadn’t already been a terrible experience I get back to my room to shower and the shower is disgusting not only dirty but someone else’s hair was all over it so clearly it wasn’t cleaned. I’m so disgusted and honestly wish we could switch hotels at this point. Such a disappointing trip I’m honestly grossed out and don’t even trust the cleanliness of the bed.    If cleanliness is important to you don’t stay here.  I truly tried to give them a second chance after they switched the room finally but It’s one thing after another.
50,Love Mandalay Bay staff was great check in was fast and easy but above all the casino always feels safe. Some places in Vegas I don’t like my wife going to the bathroom alone. Not at Mandalay. Always felt safe had no issues with my wife roaming the casino floor alone. As always we had a great trip and a great experience at Mandalay Bay!
50,I’m not sure why I never tried Mandalay Bay before but I am so happy that I tried them out this trip. The place is beautiful very well kept and updated. And might I say that the staff is great as well. I’ll definitely return.
50,We really enjoyed our first stay at Mandalay Bay! The room and bathroom are spacious and nicely decorated with high quality hardware and furnishings throughout. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. Overall a very good value for the money. Highly recommended.
50,Checking in at Mandalay Bay was such a pleasant and enjoyable experience. Melissa D. was absolutely fabulous and helped with all of the little extras that make Mandalay Bay a perfect place to stay! Thank you!!!!
50,All excellent: Staff were very helpful friendly courteous. The room was lovely and the hotel is conveniently located. Very little smoke smell. It would be very nice if there was a free coffeemaker and frig in the room.
50,Every-time I visit Vegas . I stay at Mandalay Bay you can depend on the cleanliness and great customer service. Very good price as well. A family member stayed at MGM grand and the rooms were musty and pissy😫
10,"I have stayed at mandalay bay before. In fact a few times every year before the pandemic. While I will cut them some slack because the last 2 years have been crazy nonetheless the MGM management has been pretty abysmal. Lets consider that they have not dropped their $40/day resort fee. However the services certainly have dropped and in some cases significantly. And it started prior to the pandemic. Much of the issues is with transparency. I'll try to summarize.    1. The most annoying in my opinion is that you can no longer use their spa as a guest. Now to use the spa you are require to sign up for a service. So basically if you want to use the spa fork over some money. I used to like spending 2-3 hours at the spa daily to stay away from all the casino smoke. I used to pay $30/day for the service. Now they expect you to pay $50-$200 each day. Am I suppose to get a massage every day? You are no different than any non guest in terms of using the spa. Worse some of the spa facility is not even working which they will not tell you about until you are there. Hours are also reduced. Great!    2. I was there earlier this week and more than 60% of the restaurants were closed. Some reopened the next day. All had modified schedules it seems. Something is seriously wrong when even starbucks is not opened. Again you can't tell which restaurant is closed from their app or their website. You have to try and book the restaurant to find out that it's closed. I realized all of Vegas strip hotels are dealing with this. But this is something they should tell you ahead of time. They send you emails asking ""if you are ready for your great trip"". Why can't they inform us of changes?? Maybe not hire off shore developers who can figure out a good workflow for maintaining your webpages without need a developer? I'm a software engineer I can design you a robust website that your admin with no computer skills can update times and schedule or call out notifications in a few weeks time. Hire capable folks and invest in your IT infrastructure and you won't look like you're in the stone ages.    3. Love that they implemented mobile key and mobile check in. Hoooowever implementation is lacking. Sometimes my digital key works and sometimes it does not. Mine stopped working one night. When I went downstairs mobile check in was closed so I had to get in the check in line and wait with other guests checking in to let front desk know my key didn't work. They did not appear surprised so I'm guessing it happens a lot. Looked to me like the mobile network managing doors is not always up. No network redundancy I guess.    4. They closed the tram presumably pandemic. Minor thing but again why isn't the resort fee reduced if services are reduced.    5. More inconsistent service. They go out of their way to make you decide whether you want housekeeping service with mobile check in. Fine by me. I prefer no housekeeping because thats a waste any way. So why do I go back to my room only to find housekeeping busy at work??    6. Its the winter who's going to use the pool which the $40/day fee is supposed to cover. But great that it covers local calls and a physical newspaper because the 10 people on this planet without a cellphone could certainly use that.    7. this may be a fluke since this has never happened to me before but I was jolted awake one morning when the room next to mine turn on their shower. It was that loud. Don't know why that happened since I have never experienced hearing water that easily before.    I'm sad to say that perhaps I am no longer fond of Mandalay. I think its time for me to switch brands."
50,Got quite the deal for staying 3 nights over the weekend. Great staff everyone was very nice and helpful. Room was clean and orderly. Just don’t take anything out of the mini bar. Mobile check in and out made everything very convenient for arriving and leaving.
50,Terrific hotel if you are going to the Raiders games they make it super easy and the detail of how you are going to exit and get over there is really easy. This is a very large property if you have to go to the convention center so make sure you wear the right shoes. The pool is closed realistically in the winter time but the property is very nice.
50,Vegas has gotten expensive but Mandalay is still in line with main  Stream pricing. Overall all the strip casinos / rides / food and beverage are thru the roof and it’s costly to come out to Vegas - I guess you get what you lay for. I do feel the NFR belongs back in Texas with better pricing and hospitality. The State government and mask mandates were still pushy and created a lot of unnecessary strife - like it was planned to do.
50,Went to a concert at House of Blues  then the Foundation Room  relaxed at the pools  never left the Hotel resort. Restaurants were excellent and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Planning on going back!
50,Overall GREAT EXPERIENCE  can’t wait to go back…. Loved vibe throughout casino hotel spa. Very welcoming. Rooms clean sanitized . Comfortable accommodation. Slept and played like no other time in my life …….
50,We checked in with an awesome front hotel desk person. Were able to watch the game at the stadium and walk to and from the stadium from the hotel with no problems at all. Wonderful trip and very courteous staff thanks a bunch Mandalay!
40,great service very good drinks even the ones you can get for free while playing the slots friendly staff good service overall i would have loved to hit a jackpot ( lol) but maybe next time i will.
50,It was a short stay but worth it. We are at the very end of the strip but we still manage to explore the other side just by taking the free tram and walking. It’s just like having fun and having a good exercise. Walking a lot after eating on a buffet
40,Great. Rooms are nice but view was disappointing. The room was a two night comp so if I wonder if they just give you a “ho-hum” average rooms. It was our first stay at Mandalay Bay. We loved the Casio.
30,Great place to stay but watch your bill. I was charged for nearly $600 of refreshment on the day I left. I assume for the mini bar that I never once used. I am waiting on their fix of this large mistake.
50,Our room was fantastic. We had football tickets so it’s so convenient to get to Allegiant Stadium. All of our dining was great. I didn’t win any big money but it sure was a good time! Guest services were very accommodating and assisted with an early checkin. Great stay!
50,We had the presidential suite. The staff was fantastic and I the rooms were spotless. We had our wedding reception in the room. The food we had caterer was delicious and the wedding cake they made was very nice! Couldn't have picked a better place to have it.
30,Well during the pandemic Vegas has been on lock down and unfortunately In this day in age . Casinos like this one has had a rough road to recovery. We couldn’t be more pleased with the Valet  front desk  housekeeping and the restaurant’s as well . We booked some messages and felt that those crew members needed a little more training . We felt that for the price we didn’t receive the fullest potential of service and felt rushed to leave .. and that to be honest was due to we booked these messages at 4:00 pm and the spa closed at 5 with a hour message the spa  hot tube and showers weren’t even used ..
50,Yeah came to town for a few days recently and stayed at the property. I’ve stayed at Mandalay many times so it was not new to me but what impressed me the most was the online check-in and check out!!! Seriously! How many times have you come to Vegas and you waste an hour standing in line just trying to check into your room and dump your luggage? Literally nothing would annoy me more. They have perfected an online checking system where you use the app and just stop and pick up your keys I was checked in and on my way to the elevator in less than two minutes. Checking out was just as easy drop the keys in a box they email me a receipt and go! Everything else about this hotel rocks that’s why I keep coming here hands-down the best pool on the strip great restaurants House of blues I did not have the Buffay this time so I’m not sure if it is being served again but every time I have had it in the past it is excellent. Highly recommend this great property.
50,Very professional personnel love the pools and river food was also very good definitely coming back the rooms were very clean  will definitely recommend it to others the slots were very entertaining as well i looking forward to go again to enjoy some shows
30,the room was very clean and the beds were super comfortable however the hotel should not be charging people that stay there to drink the waters or the drinks that are provided in the room. for 1 l bottle the hotel will charge you $20 and if you drink a small bottle of soda that's in the fridge that cost you 10. to me that's ripping off the people that are paying a lot of money to stay in the hotel.
50,Spent four weekday nights at Mandalay for a good friend and had a great time. Very quiet Monday to Wednesday but the night life came one Thursday and was very fun. Qould recommend the House of Blues and Lupo for good meals!!    Highly recommend.
50,We have been staying at Mandalay Bay since 1999. We've been there off and on for 19 years! I can say they are never a disappointment. They provide an aroma that is distinctive and incredibly pleasing since 1999. No other hotel/casino in Vegas has it. Always a pleasure staying there. We won't stay anywhere else! Now my daughter will not stay anywhere else as well
50,We were visiting frim Arizona celebrating our engagement (he proposed that morning before we left). We initially wanted to visit to attend the Washington football team play the Raiders but financially it wasn't feasible. But we later changed our mind and bought tickets to commemorate the weekend (my 1st time attending a a game super excited). Long story short we couldn't access our tickets via the Ticketmaster app and was unable to attend the game. So we spent the weekend getting massages and sight seeing. Still need help resolving that issue unfortunately.
40,The hotel was nice and conveniently located near the stadium. The rooms where clean and the staff was nice. I would visit the property again. The property had plenty of food options. The poker room was also nice.
10,I stayed on the top floor in a suit overall the customer service in the restaurants the lounge room service was extremely poor If you’re going to mandolin Bay Las Vegas don’t expect to be waited on or taken care of I had better service at McDonald’s
50,We stayed here for the Raiders game. The location is just across the street from the Death Star. My room was luxurious clean and quiet. The sports book was fun. Very friendly staff. Nice layout at the casino.
50,Located on the south end of the Las Vegas Strip the Mandalay Offers a unique value proposition for any who chose to stay. An all inclusive resort experience. Good restaurants services and amenities.
10,Booked flight and hotel through Allegiant - complimentary Raiders tickets with Saturday stay. Concierge said to call Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster said to call Allegient. After HOURS on the phone Allegient said we had to book room seperate to get tickets. Was I supposed to walk to Vegas? DUMB!!!
10,Booked expecting to be able to use the tram. It was only running certain hours. Nothing mentioned anything about it. No hours even posted at tram entrance. All we got in response is that's the way it is. Never would have stayed there if we would have known.
30,We stayed in a two bedroom suite. I expected floor to ceiling windows in the panoramic view but got half windows instead. One bathroom didn’t have hot water and neither bathroom had a working light in the toilet area. We called maintenance twice for them to fix it but it was never resolved properly.
50,Cant wait to go back when i have more time and take the family to enjoy the pool the reef looks amazing. The raiders stadium is a five minute walk over I 15 or you can get a ride on the golf cart what a blast.
20,"I recently stayed @ Mandalay Bay Sunday Dec. 5-6. Went to the Raider game with my wife. It was an early Birthday present for both myself and wife. I wanted to make it very special and decided to purchase the ""VIP arrival"". My wife is a very detail orientated person and she usually arranges the logistics for such trips. I told her i got this one. So on arrival we were suppose to be met by a Limo driver at the Airport with a sign for our party. I had to call twice because he was not where we were. After a 10-15 mins we find him outside talking with other drivers no sign held up or anything. I'll chalk that up to miscommunication which was the primary theme on this trip but already not a smooth start. Upon arrival to MB we were suppose to be met by a Host that would greet us ala VIP guest. We were dropped off with no such welcome. I really wanted to impress my wife with the arrangements I made but this was going awfully wrong. I had to wait in line to finally speak with someone who told me to wait longer for a host. When she arrived she seemed apologetic enough but the whole surprise factor was gone. We went upstairs to our room and within 5 mins had housekeeping come in and ask us when we were checking out? At this point i didn't want to tell my wife that i paid extra for VIP as that would have probably put me in an unfavorably light. We went to the game (another Loss) and had Dinner at the hotel. The next day i arranged for transportation to airport at 1130am. We were outside by 1120. 15 mins later with no sign of ride i had to go back in VIP lounge to ask for follow up. We were able to get the Limo to airport but just so much back and forth that i did not feel like there was anything VIP about this package at all and am highly disappointed i paid for a service that made me feel more like a fool thinking we would experience better."
50,I’ve been to Vegas over a dozen times but this was the first trip for my brother. Had a great time and there was easy access to surrounding events. We went to the Raiders game  Blue Man Group Golden Knights hockey went to Lake Meade and Hoover Dam. Fun trip !
10,Are room was downgraded without our knowledge once we entered the room we informed front desk that we paid for a king suit they apologized and gave us our king suit once we were in the king suit the next day we went to leave the room and the door was broken it would not lock we had to wait for over two hours before someone came to fix the door which ruined our morning plans once they were in the room to fix the door they informed us that the tub was leaking and we had to move rooms. It then took them another 6 hours before we were given a room.
20,Rooms were supposed to be available at 3 but weren’t available until 5 Once we got up to our rooms the key system was a joke and the staff was rude about it/spoke very poor English we had to go back down the elevators to fix the problems just wasn’t a good experience all around we won’t be back
10,I reserved a king resort room once I arrived I was told my room was given away and that it’s not promised to me if I reserve it??? Never heard of that! I was then told I could change to a king later however it wasn’t any rooms to change to. Overall very bad service!!!
50,The Mandalay Bay very nice and the staff was very pleasant and helpful!! They cam improved on the towels and cleaning the rooms little better. The hotel does have a lot to offer far as entertainment & the restaurants.
50,From the start check in was a breeze and made everything easy for us with my granddaughter with special needs made us all feel special. To the pool where they treated us like great gas can’t recommend this hotel enough they go out of their way to make everyone feel special.
30,So the over all of the Mandalay I loved the view from the room and the room was amazing it just lacked the attention to detail when it was cleaned the first go around. After we pointed out that our room had issues it was taken care of but we shouldn't have to say anything. I know Vegas like everywhere else is having staffing issues. I would stay here again but I will still expect to have a clean room and not have to say something to get it cleaned right the first time. Thanks
30,Not the room we requested AT ALL.  NO VIEW NO KING SIZE BED attached room.  Very disappointed.  You know we enjoyed our time but when you’re told NO KING beds available…really was disappointing. Plus NO discount and NO STRIP VIEW. When you reserve these things….and not given….does Mandalay Bay need a definition of what reservation means?
40,This is a nice resort we came for the game at allegiant and it is very convenient for that I think the price for valet was excessive I recently stayed at the Venetian and they didn’t charge for that but their resort fees were slightly higher which are high everywhere and charging $10 for a bottle of water is really ridiculous
20,Overpriced: charge for coffee in rooms restaurants overpriced fair to below average quality. Saloon: tried to overcharge for service compare to what I was told when making 3 appointments! Saloon wash not clean or attractive hair stylist not highly skilled & not friendly and reception staff rude makeup artist was very pleasant and highly skilled.    It was difficult to figure out the layout of the facility no told us about the tram.
50,Rooms are large beds are comfortable and rates are reasonable. The tram makes the distance from the Strip much more manageable!  Jad at the Foundation Room is the best VIP Host and will make sure you enjoy your time!
50,If you are going to a Raiders game or anything at the Stadium or south end of the strip this place is fantastic. Easy access to the stadium and a tram that takes you from Mandalay Bay to the Luxor & Excalibur which gives you direct access to NYNY MGM grand and the rest of the south end of the strip. Super close to the airport & car rental return
20,I did the mobile check-in. However the digital keyless system did not work for the elevator or the room. Checking In was a headache. There is no refrigerator to use in the room. The refrigerator in the room is used as a mini bar and you are charged $50 a day if you place your personal items in there
40,Room quality is still very good. My room was an executive King and it had 4 pillows my kind of room. Very spacious and quiet not far from the elevators on the 9th floor. The view was of the airport and partial strip. Not too shabby for my birthday room!
50,We stayed 12-3 to 12-4 for the Pac-12 football game at the Raiders Stadium. The hotel is a short and easy walk to the arena.  The room and entire facility was quite clean. The beds are comfy. We enjoyed our stay. Only part of the pool area was open with no food service outside. Bring your own K Cups for coffee unless you want to pay $12 for 2 cups not including water.
50,Had an excellent stay at Mandalay Bay. Room was clean and comfortable as expected the hotel has good amenities and customer service was great. I enjoyed the app for check in and parking and front desk was very polite and available for questions and special requests. Cons were not significant - mini bar is not for guests to use besides fetching overly priced items no free coffee kit in room and the beach pool was closed despite website saying it's open on weekends in winter season.
50,The room was way better than I thought. The tub was huge and the bed was perfect. For being a Saturday night the cost of the room was a decent price. I would definitely stay here again for a little get away
40,Mandalay Bay was a great choice but the price of in-room coffee ($12) and bottled water ($20) is a little ridiculous. Also when there are events at the nearby arena - getting into the parking lot can be a challenge as streets were blocked off and it was not easy to find a spot in the parking garage after finding out how to get there.
10,Aged property needs renovation. Inadequate staff for the needs of so many people. lacked cleanliness and upkeep. Difficult to reach anyone via telephone or on casino floors. With so many great choices in Vegas I will likely never return to this one.
40,Assigned a room on7th floor. Upon entering room it was dark dingy and window looks out into a concrete grid with dirty concrete ledge. Rooms shown online were not this kind of room. Called guest services and they refused to switch rooms for me. It took me going to priority/ online check in desk to get it changed.  Once in the room as shown online it was clean and well laid out. However there is no usable frig since the one in room is stocked with an abundance of liquor leaving no room to put anything else. There is no microwave. No late night leftovers from your dining earlier that day. No waste basket in bathroom. What? Where do you put used tissue feminine products etc? Oh don’t re-arrange the paper coffee cups left on the dresser because they have sensors and when moved the hotel ASSUMES you drank from them and charges you automatically! ($12 each). Luckily I reviewed my bill from the TV app and caught it. This is terrible. Cups were still on dresser unused. Housekeeping should be checking them upon check out and if missing them maybe assume I enjoyed a cup of joe!?
50,the room was spacious and clean and housekeeping was always on point we will be booking in the future and i have already let all my friends and family as well all of mlife hotels are mainly like this but overall mandalay bay was the best.
50,I always stay at Mandalay. The resort is outstanding the lazy river the beach all the amenities are wonderful. Being an M Life members is a plus to lots of free extras. Always a wonderful experience. Can’t wait to go back!
30,Too many fees. I was charged $12.00 to make in room coffee. Parking was nearly $60.00 for two days. The resort fee was crazy expensive and it did not seem it be for anything in particular. Mandalay Bay is showing it's age and need refurbishment.
50,Loved EVERYTHING about my experience! From the Check in (which was early) to the housekeeping staff to notch! Only minor issue was no wash cloths & hand towels in my room upon arrival. That was handled immediately when I called Guest Services…the Bell Desk service was quite efficient checked our bags after our stay since our flight did not depart for 5 hrs.
40,It was satisfying very clean bed was comfortable bathroom really nice staff was exceptional…parking is a bit far for self-parking…it is however resort fees and a $100 hold per day on your card for “incidentals” that will be refunded after stay
50,My husband and I always goto vwgas for pur anniversary. This was the best time. Hotel penthouse room was so amazing and the lady at the mlife desk. Can't remeber her name but we were short some points to stay platunum before we left and she made it to where we could stay that way. They went above and beyond in my book.
30,Pretty greedy and high priced experience between bars and mj one show. The box office increased prices right before our eyes and we received no discount for staying at the hotel or having an mlife card. See my comments above
30,Wasn't properly explained anything at check in and was given the wrong room. Very unprofessional and dismissive staff. The quality of service is very poor for an establishment that is suppose to be one of the best.
10,Taxes on resort fees on top of parking fees. How you manage to turn a 150.00 room into a 240.00 stay is a trick only MGM group can pull off. The WiFi is slow. The pool is closed. Had the restaurants are not open and I have to wear a mask everywhere even if you are vaccinated. Not enjoyable at all. And they claim to not charge vets for parking but yet they still manage to put it on the bill each night
40,Would love to come back. Just hope for a more comfortable mattress and working TV. Loved the hotel the pools were amazing the service was great! We loved that this was the first hotel in Vegas that we felt we could bring our kids too!
50,Beautiful hotel and casino! The employees are friendly. The hotel is clean and comfortable. The entire property has always been clean but have stepped it up even further since Covid. Stripsteak is an excellent restaurant albeit pricey. Seabreeze Cafe does an excellent breakfast. I’ve stayed here a couple of times and will definitely stay again.
50,Overall 10 out 10! First time staying here and definitely will now be my #1 choice! Very clean friendly atmosphere. Great bar restaurant options. Everything was excellent and bed was very comfortable!
30,First trip to Vegas! Check in was a nightmare but we made the best of it and had a great time. Toured Shelby American and saw Hoover Dam and had an unforgettable meal at Carson Kitchen downtown. Planning to take the whole family back for Christmas.
50,Our experience was excellent. Our room was ready very early the room was very clean and comfortable. Mandalay Bay’s sports books is one of the nicest. We will try to stay here on our next visit to Vegas!
30,These hotel are ridiculous besides resort fees  parking fees the atm charges $8 to get cash and over $5 for a bottle of water and cocktails are expensive. We had to leave the hotel to find a good restraunt . The hotel room window look like they haven’t been cleaned in years it totally ruined the nice view of Vegas .  Funny thing is they can’t figure out why people aren’t going to Vegas .
40,Awesome view of the strip from room. Staff was helpful but not everything open. Would stay there again.This is our 3rd stay on the strip over an eighteen year span and this was our best stay. Clean rooms and great security
50,Staff was very friendly and helped us in multiple occasions even helped us with early check in. The rooms were spacious and nice and the pool was amazing. We had a great time here and will definitely stay here for our next trip to Vegas.
50,I loved everything about my resort/hotel/casino and all of the surrounding attractions and extravagant elegant hotels. Something about Vegas and the Mandalay and Delano that just gives a certain vibe that makes me want to go back home and work harder
50,Mandalay Bay surpassed my wife’s and my expectations more than I could have ever imagined. The standard king room was absolutely huge with completely updated amenities and a very large bathroom. The bed was also extremely comfortable. The resort offers great dining options and the staff goes above and beyond to make sure you are happy. I have stayed at many resorts in Vegas and this is by far my favorite.
50,Great rooms and excellent customer service. Staff was friendly and customer service was a priority. Bell staff casino staff restaurant staff were all top notch. I will be returning to Las Vegas frequently and Mandalay Bay is where I will stay.
40,We stayed there because we attended the Santana Concert and it was a wonderful experience. Everything was clean the employees were all very attentive and helpful. The slots were fun and didn't take too much of our $$ ! We ate at the House of Blues. Good food slow service. The self parking is way at the back and you have to walk quite a bit to the reception/check in and then walk again to the elevators. I would stay there again but be prepared in sneakers when we arrive!
50,Everything from the Suite to the food snd definitely the service everywhere we went was just flawless! Our host Salvador Bigay was helpful throughout our stay! MGM Resorts is our first choice when visiting Vegas!
50,My complete weekend was a success!  Super clean and everyone is welcoming. Such great services…this is my new favorite hotel to stay in. I’ll see you all back in February 2022. I appreciate all of you!
30,This place is nice but just not for me. Old hips and knees. Walks to far to parking/Uber. Walk to room is too long.  Resort and parking fees are too high. They should pick one or the other as most people do not use what they offer for the resort fee
50,I had a great stay at you place super clean and staff was wonderful everything was in place convient excessible and food was great the room was wonderful people were super nice it was just the perfect stay
40,Great Trip Especially the hotel Service. The personnel at the Mandalay Bay Hotel where outstanding and very helpful. The made me feel and my guest feel very welcome and at ease. I would recommend Mandalay Bay Hotel to ALL my friends.
50,Everything was wonderful. The staff was very helpful. For example I parked at the garage and checked into my room. A friend called me and asked me to go and pick him up (he lives in Vegas). When I left the casino I was charged $15. Upon my return to the casino I went to the registration desk and they told me that I should not have paid so she credited me $15 on my players card which I used to pay for my breakfast the next morning. There were several other services like the one I just mentioned that the staff provided for me. All-in-all the casino staff were great!
50,I loved staying at Mandalay Bay Hotel. The room perfect. I loved the bed very supportive. The room was spacious well decorated and felt very safe and comfortable. I like that there was no smoking or smoke smell in or near the room.It was a nonsmoking room however I have stayed at some Hotels in Vegas that were nonsmoking but I could still smell smoke.
50,Mandalay Bay was clean and refreshing and the employees were very accommodating and helpful from the time I got there until the time I departed. I am looking forward to staying there again in the future.
50,Checking was easy and efficient. Room service was amazing and accommodating. Housekeeping was timely and accurate with my personal requests. Santana was awesome best live Entertainment I have experienced since 2019.
50,Spacious and comfortable room in a quiet location at the north end of the strip. Concierge service was top notch. Easy and fast check in and out. Pool was amazing. Plenty of restaurants and activities to choose from
10,Don't have any issues come up because even with all modern technology we can't find a simple reservation  Oh and we will let u sit in the lobby like a pease t while we don't have the problem while charging u a arm and a leg and half a kidney
50,Our family enjoyed everything about the resort. They have never been to the Mandalay Bay Resort. The food was great. The tournament my husband was in was fun. My husband and I have stayed at your resort and we really like it that is the reason we go back. We like the spacious floor plan of the casino and the registration area.
50,We had our wedding in Vegas! It was magical… wish we could have gotten a better room but loved the hotel . Will be back to Vegas in a couple weeks. We have stayed at many properties Mandalay was a top contender
50,We were excited about coming to Vegas and we encountered superior customer service at every turn. From  Check in to the huge selection of restaurants and shark reef. We were overwhelmed by the cleanliness of the hotel.
50,We had an amazing stay at your facility. The room was very accommodating clean and quiet. Loved the casino and the games available for play. Many choices of restaurants were available. Will definitely be back!
40,Stayed over night for the Rolling Stones concert. The hotel and its service staff are still among the best the strip has to offer. Staff is super helpful and always available. Rooms are large and immaculate. There are plenty of restaurants and stores in the hotel. If it weren't for the Stones we could have stayed inside the entire weekend!
50,Stayed at Mandalay Bay for the first time in 8 years. The property is in amazing condition. All food and beverage outlets were open and humming. The Convention Center was great. Congratulations to the team at Mandalay Bay for the upkeep during Covid-19.
50,Everything was great and staff was very polite and helpful.Casino and restaurants  we’re very clean and food was tasty too.The  location was so convenient to attend the  Concert at Allegiant Stadium.Thank You
50,We traveled with our three kids who lived the pool and the restaurants in the hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful the room was very clean and specious. We will definitely stay here again.
50,Great location far enough away from all the congestion But still close to every thing on the strip. This hotel was clean and had other amenities and attractions at the hotel that made staying here more convenient.
10,That was the first time in Vegas the sheets were dirty and call for service never show up. There was one shampoo and bathtub stuff for two people. The coffee machine was rusted …. I paid $600 for two nights for this.  I never come back and recommend to anyone
50,I had a funky layover in LV on my way to LA with very quick turnaround - less than 12 hours. But I wanted a decent night’s sleep so I decided to book a room at Mandalay Bay for that chunk of time and I’m glad I did! A beautifully-kept hotel with gorgeous greenery indoors and out plus the room was great. I used the Mobile check-in/checkout system and it was flawless. All the employees I spoke with were friendly and helpful. I will have to return for a longer stay next time to take advantage of all the amenities.
30,We stayed at this beautiful hotel over Thanksgiving weekend price was OK but they definitely nickel and dime due on everything they were charging $50 to use the refrigerator in your room they are charging you six dollars for a bottle of water that should be free and parking is extremely expensive.
50,We enjoyed everything about the Mandalay Bay from the restaurant options to the pool area to the casino. The rooms are comfortable. And the Shark Aquarium is a nice addition. We would stay here again.
10,Booked a room thinking that was the room I was gonna get not expecting it to be on a certain floor but expecting to have the room I paid for showed up was told that rooms are first come first serve and they didn’t have anything comparable to what I paid for and was not going to comp me or lower the price all they did was give me food and beverage credit and put me in a dirty room absolutely terrible terrible experience. Ended up having to stay in a room overlooking the mass shooting that I attended in 2017 because that’s the only room with a king bed they had available will never never return. Thanks Mandalay Bay for bringing back all the trauma I’ve worked to overcome.
50,Knowing that MGM is the owner of Mandalay Bay we knew that it would be a top-notch resort during our stay. I highly recommend downloading their app on your phone; we were able to make dinner reservations and book experiences so easily. I would say that if you are staying here for the view be sure to request a room that faces North.
10,If you want to pay outrageous prices get very low quality zero service lots of excuses and not even a complimentary bottle of water or coffee in your room- this is the place! Low staff low quality service should not equal high prices!! Very disappointed!
50,We booked a room with two queen beds. The room was very nice with very comfortable beds that make you sleep like a baby. The bathroom is large with and has a separate room for the toilet. The staff are very friendly efficient and helpful. We had booked the room with a third party and there was a mistake but once we got to Mandalay Bay the staff resolved it right away.
30,The parking was a complete joke as there was one person working valet and the line was too long. We had to drive around a couple of times before we could find the self parking and the self parking was so far away we had to walk quite a bit to get to the hotel check in.
30,Had an issue with my room not being turned over and ready when I arrived after being told by staff that it had been cleaned and it was ready to go.. This was upsetting to say the least. After a long trip you expect things to be as they should
50,Hands down best hotel on the strip! Far enough away you don’t get all the traffic. Staff were all very helpful and very knowledgeable. Rooms were very clean pools were gorgeous! Restaurants were very good and good prices.
50,They let me check in at 9 am and had a limo pick up me and my friends it also included late check out and a limo back to the airport plus free beer/water/coffee in VIP lounge. I wouldn't come here again without that VIP experience it was amazing.
30,Most hotels include a gym and wifi in the cost of the room and we were charged $43.22 per night. Room was large and nice had to clean out bath tub. Only one pool was open and there were too many people for everyone to get a seat.
50,Great room and service. Would come back again. But be sure to check in person and not use the app. You get much better options for room and important questions answered which the app cannot provide. Price was very affordable as well.
40,Great Stay. I would stay again. We saw Michael Jackson One which I highly recommend. We had an Issue with loud neighbors very early in the morning which was resolved by the hotel. Was very happy the pool was open during the winter season. It was a nice 70 degrees outside.
50,Love Mandalay Bay! Service and amenities were top notch and the customer service was incredible!! Can’t wait to go back with the family again. We saw the best shows enjoyed the best dinners and relaxed in the cabanas! Perfect trip!
50,Had a fantastic room comped at Mandalay Bay. Suite was large clean and overall great. Tram is back running so distance is not as bad at the south end of the strip. Casino was busy but not too crowded.
50,Mandalay bay had an excellent suite for the price. We had a party of 4 on two beds so we brought two queen air mattresses and they still fit. Beach area could be open later (for the hot tub) during low season. Staff was super friendly.
50,I’ve been to the Mandalay Bay many times but this was my first time staying there. It will not be my last! The room was spacious clean and very comfortable.    My only gripe is paying for parking. It’s such a money grab. I’ve been coming to Vegas for 35 years and parking was always free. Now you pay for parking everywhere (not just at Mandalay).
30,"we just did a weekend getaway had to pay for parking even when I am a gold member I went to the front desk teller straight up told me ""I dont know how to enable for parking""    Bottom line the resort and gaming and entertainment value were all there great time. The fees and lack of training of the staff were disappointing"
20,The check-in process was ridiculously complicated and time-consuming. By the time I got checked in it was too late to enjoy any of the amenities I chose the hotel for (pool and aquarium.) Staff were harried abrasive and not at all helpful. Room was not very clean (although it was very nice technically but for that much $$ it ought to have been clean) and the lobby smells very VERY strongly of artificial floral fragrance which really aggravated my allergies on top of everything else.
30,Decent rooms but housekeeping less than satisfactory. Unable to reach anyone to resolve my issues with housekeeping. Thank heavens for the bell caps. They are the hotels saving grace. They are very helpful.
40,Visited for a three-night solo trip during Thanksgiving.    I'll get this out of the way first: Despite signs everywhere indicating that masks were required nobody was enforcing them so about 50% of the resort patrons went about maskless or wore them as chin-diapers. It made me feel slightly unsafe but your mileage/risk tolerance may vary!    Otherwise I had a great stay. I was given a pool-view room on the 14th floor and was quite impressed with how clean and well-decorated the room was. The bathroom was especially great featuring both a tub and a walk-in shower and a toilet behind a door.  Another great feature that often gets overlooked is lighting; there were so many lights in the room (wall lamps desk lamps ceiling lights) that it was possible to adjust the light settings to your liking. Many hotels I've previously stayed at have always felt dim/underlit but that was not a problem here! The only drawback was that with so many lights it could be slightly tedious to turn on and off each one individually. There was no central hub to turn everything on or off with one switch. The room also did not have complete black-out curtains despite it being listed in the room description but they did block out significant enough light in the morning.  Only disappointment about the room was regarding the minibar prices and especially that bottled water was not complimentary. Do not open the minibar if you don't want to get charged.  Otherwise the room was a great retreat.    The casino floor took a little bit to get oriented that first day. It was pretty jarring how far the Shark Reef and food court was from the rest of the resort.  The slots were not kind to me unfortunately. The hotel is on the south end of the strip but you could walk through to Luxor to Excalibur to NYNY without touching the sidewalk.  Self-parking is typically $15 but as a Pearl mlife member it was complimentary which I greatly appreciated. The parking entrance was tricky to find at one point I ended up on the freeway and ended up taking a wild detour.    Every staff member I encountered (however briefly) was friendly and helpful and made me feel like a valued guest. This being Vegas I did sometimes feel like the resort was trying to get every dollar out of me (for instance the convenience stores did not have price labels so you'd only know the damage at the registry) but otherwise this is a solid resort for a relaxing stay in Vegas.
20,Wouldn't stay again. Staff was understaffed and very unaccommodating. Male at the pool was exposing his butt and privates sunbathing infant of our family. Staff did nothing to stop. Requested a wine opener and was told to walk across the street to a liquor store to purchase. Only one line for the M Life rewards and took over 45 min to sign up. Etc etc. Will not be going back. Much better values on the strip with more caring and accommodating staff. The rooms were nice.
40,Nice experience but y’all gotta heat the pools and hot tub because it was luke warm at best. Casino was nice too to high of minimums was a bummer but i blame myself for that there was one check in lady who was nice but I can’t remember her name. Hope I can try again when it’s hotter outside!
20,I reserved a Resort King room with this hotel and was given a lesser room as they did not have my reserved room available. I know the price difference I saw online and was only given a 75.00 food credit which didn't even cover a breakfast. Never again
50,The slot machines are very good and clean very quick check-in would definitely come again when have more time would love to spend it at the pool hopefully we'd come back in December after Christmas...
40,Nice large and well-equipped rooms.  Generally nice and helpful employees.  Location is on the far end of the strip. It is OK if you don't want to go anywhere else or are up to taking public transportation Uber etc.  Casino was very smokey at times due to second hand cigarette smoke which was difficult to ignore/avoid.  If Raider fans are in town for a football game I would stay elsewhere as bars restaurants and casino were crowded noisy and full of cigar smokers.
10,We recently stayed at the Mandalay Bay for the 4 day thanksgiving weekend and boy were we disappointed. The advertisement was that they are doing enhanced cleaning due to Covid 19 that's why we chose this hotel. Apparently they did that in 2020 when opening after the pandemic. At the moment Mandalay Bay is NO LONGER doing ENHANCED CLEANING!!! The room that we stayed in was DUSTY and the housekeeping was subpar at best. The first night we were there there was only 1 face towel provided. I had to call the operator the next day to remind the housekeeping about leaving some face towel for our room. Upon coming back to our room around 4 p.m. there was still no face towel. I had to flag one of the housekeepers to give us some face towels. The room was not cleaned thoroughly at all. It is still dusty (TV and Counter Tops). You can see the dust as soon as you walk in that my wife had to break out her stash of alcohol wipes to clean the surfaces and the remote control plus the door handles and the telephone. This is FALSE ADVERTISING as even in the MLIFE APP it says they do enhanced cleaning.    According to their web page:  Enhanced Sanitation  Guests to our resorts will find easy access to hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes provided by Clorox throughout the properties. Although our cleaning protocols have always been important we have increased the amount of routine cleaning with a focus on high-touch surfaces and common areas using clean products that meet EPA guidelines.    This is a BIG FAT LIE!
20,When the room was serviced housekeeping will take all the towels left on the ground (as expected) but they will not leave any clean towels. I had to constantly request body towels and hand towels.  Also we ran out of Kleenex. Housekeeping also failed to leave an new box. Makes me wonder if they even clean the room. The beds were made. That was about it.  The carpet was super dirty. The additional seating in the room - all chairs were stained and really dirty. Didn't feel comfortable seating or placing anything on those chairs.  The rate wasn't the cheapest. I would have expected to have a clean room (at the very least).  Another inconvenience we experienced was the check in. We did our checking prior to 3pm via Mobil. However the room was not available until closer to 4pm or 5pm.
40,Everything was fine. I'm so tired of wearing masks I could vomit My favorite buffet in the entire city is closed. The room was clean and I had a restful sleep. I would check to see if the Raiders are playing before scheduling your stay if you're not there to see the game.
40,Although this is down at the end of the strip…..which is perfect to attend any event at the new stadium….it is close to the airport and convenient for shopping and great dining. The Casino and Sports Book are excellent.
10,Before booking this hotel we called the reception and were told that pools are heated but it wasn't true. Water in both pools was very cold. Untrue promises of heated pools were the only reason we booked this hotel.
10,We were celebrating out anniversary and order a regular king size room the staff instead put us on double queen accessibility room that really killed the mood. We were never told when cheking in that the room had changed. We tried to call reception a couple of times but we never able reach reception.
10,No hot water in shower and was told you have to open the hot water in tub then you can get hot water in shower few minutes later; mini bar will charge you if you just open it never have this kind of experience in any other hotel
30,This was our first stay at Mandalay Bay. We heard very good reviews from others and the couple we were vacationing with. Unfortunately the customer service was extremely lacking. There was no room service available - no one told us this upon check-in. It was only after >10 minutes of being on hold for guest services that we found out. Upon check-in the staff was not very welcoming did not review the amenities provide internet information etc. . There were no restaurants open during the day. We couldn't reach guest services on the phone repeatedly or get anyone to assist us with baggage upon checkout. They did a great job of keeping the hotel clean and sanitized the rooms are very nice but the customer service is extremely lacking. We have made many trips to Vegas and this was the worst experience we have had. It was very out of line with what we have become used to. They also charged for in room coffee and hardly provided any bathroom amenities. This is not the standard Vegas experience. In all good conscience my husband and I cannot recommend this hotel.
30,Do not book through Priceline even with reading the fine print there were surprise charges at checkin . Which I now have to go back and review the two. I booked in advance to ease the stress of check in. Parking should not be connected to the casino  that is second hand smoke at its finest. The room layout was perfect sucks that you can smell the cigarette smoke at night dusting of the rooms especially the baseboards can be improved.If you smoke this place is perfect for you!!
20,Not satisfied at all. I addressed the problem to front desk but no one care . Because I booked through Expedia . Which I don’t think is Expedia problem. I asked for a late check out and I was granted 4hours for fifty dollars  But I changed my mind. I believe Mandalay Bay should care more about the comfort of the guests
50,The room was great. The price was great. We took the tram to Excalibur then started walking the strip from there. The casino and beach area was well kept. The check in/check out experience required no staff everything was done through the app.
50,Great for a staycation! Many things to do in the hotel if it’s too hot or cold outside. You can take a 3-5 minute tram ride to the strip so it’s just close enough if you prefer not to be on the strip. And if your going to an event at the new stadium there’s a walkway!
50,This was my second time at Mandalay Bay. Love it! Awesome pool area with beach wave pool and lazy river. The room was a good size nice decor and clean. Many good food options including a food court which is next to the Shark Reef which is a must see. The hotel is connected to the Luxor where I visited the Titanic Exhibit. Tram links to Luxor and Excalibur. Looking forward to going back again soon.
50,We stayed at the Mandalay Bay Resort to attend the Raiders Game. It was so convenient and we had excellent service. The room was very clean and large compared to other resort hotels. We definitely will stay at this resort again.
10,Whilst it was Thanksgiving weekend and the property was busy it feels as if they have yet to recover to pre-COVID service levels.  Everything is chargeable despite a huge resort fee being added - as typical for services no one wants. Coffee is $7 in the room.  Elite members are not upgraded even when better room exist.
50,From the great helpful staff to cleanliness of the rooms my experience was top notch. Great variety of food games and entertainment. Taking the tram to explore was a great way to get around. Awesome 5 days
50,We had an excellent time here! Staff was great any questions were answered. Fun atmosphere great places to eat. Would go back anytime. Everyone was good about masks too which I appreciate greatly. So fun
50,We stayed at Mandalay Bay for our Vegas vacation. We had a great experience all around! Loved the room bed was so comfy and room was quite spacious. Valet made parking a breeze. Staff was very helpful and friendly always willing to answer any and all questions we had. We would highly recommend staying here.
30,On a recent visit to the hotel check-in was fine. Got two rooms across from each other even though request was made at last minute during check-in. Great!    Got to the room and found that only bath towels were provided. No hand towels. Also only one bar of soap (expected the normal two for a room that does not use soap dispensers). Tried for 10-15 minutes calling guest services and call was disconnected. Tried again for 10 minutes before we had to leave for dinner. No response. Only wait time. Went downstairs to the front desk and requested the towels and hand soap. Was told it would be delivered that night. Nothing upon our return from dinner.    To make things worse a lot of hair was found on the shower floor. No way that could have been missed by the staff. I had to clean it myself. Not something I expected. Took a picture and went back to the front desk. Thought management should know so they can take corrective action. Maybe retraining is needed. Asked to talk to the front desk manager. After waiting a brief time someone who was manning a front desk check-in position appeared to act as a middleman and agreed the situation was not acceptable. He offered to have the situation addressed that night (was already late). I agreed to let the cleaning staff take care of this the next day. Don't think the front desk manager who was clearly on duty cared to talk to me even though I requested it.    To my surprise after returning to the room I saw someone had delivered the towels and soap while I was in the shower. So I do have to give credit to the second person at the check-in counter for making this happen.    Nevertheless not sure I will return soon after this experience even though we used to enjoy this hotel when the kids were growing up. The room was otherwise fine.
50,A valued experience for a Disabled Veteran. Great Family atmosphere and each staff member makes you feel like you are at an Elite Country Club Experience. There partnership with the MGM group provides great options and I will not stay anywhere else in VEGAS!!!
50,We LOVE staying at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino because the suites are well appointed and the resort has so much to offer with all the great restaurants and pool complex. There is really do reason to ever leave the resort once you are there. Our favorite restaurants are all there including the House of Blues for breakfast Fleur and KUMI to mention a few. We have also gotten to know Richie Conti in Management over the years and he is such a great hands on guy!
20,Woke up to loud neighbors on both sides every morning. Plumbing dripping in toilet loud. No fan in restroom. Can hear people loud and clear walking past your room. Like being on a cruise ship. Won't be staying here again.
30,The Mandalay Bay is pretty much all automated and you rarely deal with an actual person. I get it it’s the way the world is now but you went to Vegas for the VIP treatment. Those days are long gone.
10,We booked connecting rooms because we have 3 younger children. The first night my wife and I had to sleep on different floors in different towers. The next day they offered 2 rooms on the same floor but at different ends of the hall. They didn't even have the rooms we prepaid for available they made a compensation offer that we accepted but when it came time to pay the bill they reneged on the offer. I would never stay here again. They should live up to the offer they made. I requested a manager on multiple occasions but was never actually connected to one. There was always a go between.
50,My wife's birthday was in the November 25th she had never been in Vegas nor a casino. So is decided to surprise her with a short trip to Vegas the hotel overall was great clean nice view and great vibes.
50,The service was outstanding and professional. The rooms and beds very comfortable. All staff were very courteous and helpful. The casino  and staff great. The restaurant s were really nice especially the House of blues. You have to visit nice setting music and lots of food.
50,My husband and I spent 5 nights at Mandalay Bay celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. It was amazing. First off this place is MASSIVE! It's much bigger then we anticipated. There is so much to do inside the actual resort that you have to actually plan and make time for outside activities.  Great/friendly staff great entertainment and amazing food choices. The only downside is that it's at the end of the strip so the view is a little restricted. Other than that I highly recommend!!
50,We really enjoyed our stay at Mandalay Bay. Every person we encountered was friendly and happy to help. Except for the lack of soap in our room this was a super experience. We'd be delighted to stay at Mandalay again in the future.
50,My brother and I traveled to Vegas for a reunion of sorts and to take in a Championship Boxing event.  The accommodations were great staff outstanding. Rooms were excellent.  I even was granted a room change for an improved view from my 13th floor suite.  Thank you Sebastian.  The massive up charge for a bottle of water cashews and mm’s is a little out of line but hey its “VEGAS”  Will stay at Mandalay Bay again.    Thank you…
20,The only 2 pools open were small and had cold water. The one little hot tub had about 10 kids splashing around in it. We stayed 3 nights. During 2 of those nights there were people yelling loudly in the hallway. It took the police about 2 hours to deescalate the situation and stop the commotion. The water in the sink pipes was gurgling during the evenings as well. The beds were way too soft not supportive at all. The restaurant Lupo was delicious! Having free self-parking at 10 other hotels (if you paid the $15 a day fee) was very convenient.
20,"I write this review because I couldn't find any way to communicate to hotel management. The Mandalay Bay hotel is awful.    I stayed at Mandalay Bay for two nights from October 4 through 6 for the InsurTech Connect conference. My check-in experience was the worst in many many years and deserves to be reported. The check-in agent insisted on speaking in code. She said she wanted to ""verify"" my driver's license. I challenged her asking if she was just going to make a copy and she doubled down insisting that she was going to ""verify"" it as though she was going to call Gavin Newsom to confirm that the card was legit. She made a copy. She insisted on charging me for ""incidentals"" but refused to acknowledge that the fee was a ""deposit"" that would be returned if not used.    Attending an insurance conference I was naturally curious about the shooting in 2017 almost exactly 4 years before my check-in. I asked if it was true that MGM had paid $800M to victims of the shooting. The agent responded that if I mentioned that subject again she would call security. Incongruously she continued on the subject explaining that she had been on duty that evening and the subject was difficult. Finally she announced that no room was available at check-in but that I would receive a text message when the room was available.    Eight hours later at 7pm I called to ask when my room would be ready and was told that no room had been assigned to me and that they would try to find a room. They thought me lucky that they found a room for me. I concluded that the disturbed check-in agent had chosen to punish me.    I complained when I returned to get a key and to the credit of the staff on duty they acknowledged the poor service and offered a $50 discount on in-house food. That said the stay was still poor:  * the key card would not activate the elevator and I had to return for a replacement key twice; several other guests at the elevator had the same problem.  * the bed-side lamp in the room did not function  * the bathroom was stocked with no towels smaller than full-size bath towel  * when I checked out in the morning after two nights my hotel wi-fi access was immediately cut off despite the hefty ""resort fee"" demanded by the hotel    All in all it was a terrible stay. I needed to stay another night in Las Vegas and moved to the (fabulous) Tropicana which managed as a Doubletree by Hilton actually has trained staff. I will NEVER return to the Mandalay Bay Hotel. They treat guests badly."
20,Key for self parking didn’t work. We were charged for minibar items that we did not consume. The restaurants we ate at were extremely expensive.The hotel nickel and dimed us to the death. I would imagine that this degree of ripping off customers is the same in all the MGM Resorts.
30,Here for basketball. Not enough tables open during day. Room was very noisy. As next door neighbors took a shower it would wake you up every morning. Could hear their TV as it was in our own room & you could tell they didn't have it up very loud either.
10,Complained 3 times about this. Kids everywhere. Headed back to bellagio where they offer adult only pools. Jacuzzis filled with kids. Kids running rampant and mediocre cleaned rooms. Great view of strip on the 24th floor
20,The hotel lobby looked clean and upscale and the room looked clean and nice. After arriving on a late flight and in desperate need of a shower I discovered the room has NO wash cloths. There were 3 large dry towels but nothing to wash your body with. So I had to use a huge dry towel to shower. The next day I needed to iron my clothes. The iron was a $9 Walmart iron at best and leaked constantly. It also kept turning off automatically. So I had to unplug and re-plug it in every 15 seconds or so. It took forever to finish ironing one piece of clothing. That morning I wanted coffee and the room did have a 'do-it-yourself' coffee maker and cups sealed in plastic. The cost to make your OWN coffee was $12. The daily 'resort fee' was $44 .... this did not include coffee a working iron or wash cloths. It was a frustrating stay at a hotel I'd always hoped to enjoy. I've visited Vegas on a number of occasions usually staying at New York New York Bellagio or off the strip at Tahiti. This was my first and last stay at Mandalay Bay. A complete waste of money.
50,In the zillions of times I've been to Las Vegas in my life I've never stayed at Mandalay Bay. Go figure. By some twist of fate my family and I ended up at this amazing hotel this year and we were not disappointed. I had heard that the Mandalay Bay pool was the best and I can now wholeheartedly agree. My 7-year old loved the shallow pool (heated to a comfortable enough temperature to stay poolside all day in the month of November) and I loved that there were sometimes more lifeguards than children present. I'm never going to leave my child unattended in a pool but it's great to know I'm not the only one taking safety so seriously. The wave pool was more fun than I thought it would be and the lazy river was our family favorite. Poolside services were minimal because it was November but the staff were still more attentive than I have experienced in other pools and cabanas.  Our room was spacious clean and comfortable. The mattresses were comfortable (and that makes a world of difference on a trip!); the services to our room were fast and friendly and the bell service was friendly and professional.  We loved the location of the hotel as we had a great view of the strip without being right in the middle of it. We were able to walk to a couple of our activities but we also would have been able to park in a myriad of parking garages that are available using our MGM properties parking pass.  We were fans of the app. We were able to use our phones for the parking pass for the room key and for reviewing our room charges. My only frustration was that the app was not accessible if I opened it while already on the elevator due to low wifi signal. However if I already had opened the app connected the wifi and turned on my phone's bluetooth before entering the garage or elevator we had no problems at all. You can also easily obtain a plastic key if you really want it.  We would definitely stay here again.
30,We paid for early check in but the room hadn’t been cleaned. Over promised under delivered. I sincerely doubt the room was cleaned more like straightened up. The previous occupants soap was still in the shower after the room had been “cleaned”.
20,Really no reason to stay at MB anymore. Facilities dated. South end of strip dead. Restaurants I want to eat at are all at a long walk or uber ride to Cosmo or further.    Service uninspired and corporate.    Not a terrible place but definitely would rather be at wynn cosmo aria…
50,The staff was great. The rooms were spacious. I recommend staying at Mandalay Bay. There are many good options and entertainment for kids and adults. Convenient to other casinos for variety in your experience.
20,Stay at your own risk. Despite the state mandate the resort’s own policy that they make you aware of and their signs the mask policy is not enforced. With the large crowds enclosed nature of the building and tight area such as the elevator lobby it has a risky feel with so many unmasked guests. Of all the places we were in Vegas this had the lowest compliance. People concerned about their health and public health measures need to avoid Mandalay Bay.
50,Easy to check in and out. Rooms were clean and staff was friendly. Casino had a great night life! Lots of food options! I would come back and highly recommend. The beds were comfortable and loved how dark the rooms got we slept in both nights.
50,The staff took care of us and was so nice. The casino was amazing and the restaurants were accommodating. The aquarium was a wonderful experience and the drinks were so good. The elevators are fast as heck too
50,Amenities were excellent  foods were good bars are good parking not an issue great pools 24 hour market or store was available and that was really great. the 2 bedroom suite was perfect for relaxation.
10,We went to guest services to get our room and then went to my room to find another guess shoes and clothes in there! We were shocked and scared! We went back to guest services to see what was going on and we were kept waiting at least another half hour trying to find a room as they were sold out! They did not try to upgrade us or give us a free meal or anything! My son had a bloody nose and got some on the sheets and instead of housekeeping changing the sheets they just made the bed.
40,"Strip view was great! The mini bar/refreshment center priced are crazy. $20 for a 1 liter bottle of Fiji water? Nuts!  Must have moved them and tripped sensors on the tray because I was charged for 2 bottles the very first day. And they will charge you $50 if you use the mini bar to store your ""personal items."" Jeez."
30,The staff was very nice and helpful during our stay. My main problem was with the room. We stayed in one of their suites for a couples vacation after I proposed. The room was nice but the shower would overflow if both shower heads were on I’m guessing the drain is clogged. Also the bathroom sink near the entrance of the suite leaked water whenever you’d use it. It was a nice room but definitely wasn’t worth the money.
30,I have stayed here many times over the last 15 years. It seems to have went downhill A little bit especially on the variety of table games in casino. If you are looking for a good variety of games I would stay somewhere else several games I enjoyed in the past are no longer there such as blackjack switch let it ride four card poker and Mississippi stud
50,I booked this hotel to see Santana at the House of Blues 11/12. I am so glad i did. It was a fabulous experience The front desk are so friendly and accommodating Amazing 60th floor views spacious beautiful room excellent housekeeping hotel staff & casino!
50,Modern hotel room clean and comfortable. Charged for self-parking about $15 but it works for all MGM resorts self parking spaces during the night which is quite convenient. Deposit is $100. Resort fee is $44.22(I do not even go to the resort but understand). Hope the deposit fall out sooner.
30,I was on a business trip for a convention. We got in mid Sunday afternoon and there wasn't any rooms available when we checked in. Upon getting in the room i had to take a quick shower before going down to the convention. The shower pressure would only work if the water was scorching hot. We didn't have time to switch rooms so we managed.
50,So easy to check in through the mobile app rooms were beautiful pools were beautiful. Casino staff friendly and helpful. Close to the stadium for the football games. Lots of options for entertainment.
50,This hotel made our stay in Vegas. If we didn’t want to go far it had everything we needed - food and entertainment. We enjoyed the casino shark aquarium Micheal Jackson One show boxing match restaurants Starbucks and our room was fantastic with a beautiful view of the strip.
10,The worst stay I've ever had in Vegas the hotel staff was bad my room seem to be falling apart as the days went on in my stay when I called to get the problems they acted if I was lying about what was wrong in my room will never stay here again
50,Great stay. Lots to do but far from the main strip. Favorite place to stay. Avoid football home games though. It’s is crowded. Want to go back for some of the shows they offer. House of blues food is wonderful.
30,Overpriced for what I got. Staff was friendly. No refrigerator to use in room no fee coffee option in room which is crazy to me... they charge $10 a cup for the room coffee. The ice machine was broke for 2 days and no access to other floor to get ice.
50,We spent 6 nights here in November. Went to Vegas for a Raiders game at Allegiant Stadium. Hotel was conveniently located walking distance to the stadium for the game. Room was nice and comfortable. Loved the tub to soak in after walking all over Vegas.
20,It was an average room.. I didn’t like the fact they charge $50 for using and/or moving things around in their fridge.. Charge $20 per bottle of water in the room.. Plus charge a resort fee where you think we can at least put leftover food in the fridge without being charged $50 per day to do so.
10,I booked my room months in advance by phone I had a reservation number too. When we got there our room was unavailable to us for the weekend. Then the tried to give us a lesser room. After finally admitted they screwed up they gave me a suite with a desert view and airport view instead of the strip view promised us. Never again. You got me once shame on you with all the rooms you have to do that to people
20,No washcloths when I got to my room then the toilet stop flushing I put a work order in at 10am the toilet wasn’t fixed until 3am…then the tub didn’t have hot water. So I couldn’t take a bath. Very disappointed
50,I love the vibe of the casino. The eateries and bars are very good. Love the shops and the rooms are very comfortable. Our room was a king deluxe and love the big tub the bed and pillows were comfy. The view from our room was very nice at night. The front staff is very friendly.
10,I am writing this in my room at Mandalay. I went down to the front desk this morning to change rooms because multiple babies next door were screaming all night. I couldn’t sleep at all. Completely miserable. Front desk tells me all rooms are booked and to call later when people check out. I call later and they tell me there are no rooms. No solutions. Just deal with it. Babies are STILL crying as I write this. Two days of sleep lost on vacation. First time staying at this property and it’s miserable. No answers from staff.
50,Central to every place we wanted to visit. Mandalay Bay was accommodating to all our needs.  Service was great easy check in on a busy weekend. Easy check out. Clean room. Great food. Cannot complain.
40,Decent rooms at a decent price. Friendly and helpful staff throughout. Nice location at the end of the strip. Original room was not in the best shape but the staff was eager to help out and provide other accommodations.
30,Wi-Fi signal nonexistent in room; no fix offered by staff. I'm a top administrator for a big event the resort is hosting and promoting but I've had to work in loud crowded lobby spaces on the admin. tasks/organization.
50,Nice Affordable and Comfortable place to stay. I would recommend anyone to reserve this hotel and guarantee they will not be disappointed. Food courts and restaurants are top notch and affordable. Book a room.
50,There was a wonderful experience for me and my family. I recommend this hotel to my friends and family. Easy access to the parking lot. Good variety of slot machines. I liked that everybody wearing masks
50,Trip was for both Raiders game and my birthday. Easy mobil check in.  Room very clean and comfortable. Front desk when getting key for rooms  gentleman came over made sure getting it done and then asked for room number and wrote the number apron key holder and put the keys in it for us.
20,Quick and dirty review    Broken doors and phones are not what you expect from a hotel of this stature and cost. Cap that with food left in the minibar and you begin to question the cleanliness and sanitary procedures. This was a very disappointing stay. I’d try another resort.
30,Service is losing out to cost cutting. Many reastraunts and shops are closed or on limited hours. Vegas is still vegas but it is easy to see the cost cutting is affecting the service. Mandalay bay has slipped less than others.
50,The strip view was amazing the room was big the bathroom was big the room and bathroom was clean the staff friendly. I was incredibly impressed with the whole stay. Would definitely recommend and would stay there again!
20,Below average if you are looking for an exceptional Vegas experience Room and common areas were not clean Cigarette butts in the hallway and trash outside elevators was piled overflowing Overall atmosphere was tired
50,If you’re looking for a relaxing and amazing atmosphere Mandalay Bay is the place to be. Great rooms and great staff make for an amazing stay. The strip view at night is amazing. Go and check it out you won’t be disappointed.
40,Bud Crawford fight boxing event fun with my husband and we ate breakfast in room service was nice staff helpful and friendly my husband loved it and wanted to stay there again for our next trip to Las Vegas
50,We will be back soon! Everything about this property was amazing! We loved the tropical resort experience the casino was amazing. The dinning choices were wonderful. The room was spacious and clean. We will be back soon!
20,I have the housekeeper coming in to clean our room and provide towels and she stole my Gucci jacket I have contacted the Mandalay Bay and they are doing an investigation I’m waiting to hear back I asked if they review the surveillance cameras
50,We had a great experience. Highly recommend this place. Staff was very helpful and nice. The room was amazing! The location is great. The hotel has a tramp to connect with Luxor and Excalibur. We were only there one night. Hope to come back soon.
40,We encountered a smell of weed coming through the vents next door!! Housekeeping put a piece of cardboard over the vent. Security could smell it in the hallway! There was nothing they could do. For two nights finally we were giving another room thanks to Joshua at the front desk
30,I usually have a good time with m life but this trip was different.  My water went out which is no ones problem but I would think an easy fix I didn’t have time to get ready and check out. But they offered me water bottles to wash up how am I gonna wash my ass with water bottles. Lol  On the ground I was betting big bets didn’t get offered anything from the pit boss not sure exactly how it works. But I may look into a diff branch. Thx for the good times m life!
50,We only stayed 1 night because we were on our way to California. We were used our comp night reward and only had to pay the resort fee and taxes. Our reservation was for an Elite King room and was upgraded to a Queen Skyroom....very very nice.
50,"I can stay at any MGM property comped. This is my favorite. I've stayed at Bellagio and Aria. And have walked thru most of the others. I love Mandalay the most. Hands down the best pool on the strip. They actually have real sand and waves which makes me feel like I'm on vacation. I've only stayed in the suites and penthouses but the rooms were huge with amazing views. I win more here on slots than any other casino hands down. By far which is one of the main reasons I come back. My host is amazing and keeps me happy so I don't want to go anywhere else. For the people that say this is too far south on the strip you can walk indoors from here to Excalibur then walk across the street and you are on the ""strip"" or you can take a cab or Uber up for a few bucks. Or its a ten minute outside walk which I enjoy. I walk instead of using the free limo service provided to me. So no I don't think it's too far down."
20,I love visiting Vegas but this time I was very disappointed with my room at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. My room was dark with only a couple of lamps. The room had a wall full of curtains but there was a wall behind the curtains. There was a small window in the corner of the wall that u had to stand directly in front of to see out of it. Check out the picture. So no natural light with 4 dim lit lamps. The ice machine went out 3 nights on the floor we were staying on. We couldn't get to the other floors because your key only access the floor u staying on. So I was forced to call room service to get buckets of ice and gave tips for them to bring it up. Didn't like that at all. It's a fridge in the room that's stocked with there overpriced items ($10 for a $2.50 bottle of water) . Then they charged me $12.50 for picking up a coffee cup. They said I picked it up for more than 20 seconds so they charged me. I ended up getting it deducted. They had no face towels and said it was a shortage. Very disappointed in my room. Elevator key access pad was broke and no sign on it. That was my second time staying at Mandalay Bay and because of this stay...I wont be back to Mandalay Bay.
50,This is a great hotel we stayed for a week with my family and kid they were all friendly and always looking forward to helped us we went to the Shark Reef and it was great as well I a little disappointed that the wave pool was closed but other than that everything was great
30,We stayed here because we saw a concert at HOB. Other than the bed not being comfortable and for some odd reason the drain made a gurgling sound all night our stay was awesome. Clean and friendly staff for sure.
10,House keeping must have skipped our room upon check in. Our room had trash filled with dirty tampons and blood on the bed. The tv was on with a fireplace channel all lights were on and the room smelled disgusting. The person at the front desk ONLY gave us a new room.
50,Rooms staff and casino is great. The rooms are spacious the staff is very friendly and accommodating to requests. The casino is clean and good variety of machines. I would stay here again and recommend this property.
40,Nice property but Casino was limited as to the number of live black jack and Craps tables at night and the minimum bets were in the $50 range. Shows in the area were had to find but that could have been bad timing on our part.
20,This corporation has worked hard to monetize almost every amenity you would want on your stay. I’m surprised they don’t charge to charge your phone using their outlets. If you stay don’t touch the minibar items at all unless you like paying $15 for a kcup of coffee or $20 for a bottle of water… it’s not the working people on the ground bleeding you dry folks—it’s the megacorporation.
10,Waste of money. They don’t hold reservations and just sell their rooms to the highest bidder. The slaves they had working their were kind but the people in charge just want to get rid of you and give you minimal help and compensation for your issues and don’t value you as a paying customer! Highly not recommended!!!!!!
30,The location is bad. I spent so much money going to the main part of the strip. Everything in the room is an exorbitant price and they don't have fridges or microwaves in the room. Save your coins and get a room on the main strip
50,I had the pleasure of staying at Mandalay Bay in November. The contactless room assignment and digital key is awesome. Out of the transportation to your room and skip the desk. Rooms are modern clean and up to date. Friendly caring staff.
50,My wife and I have both worked in a hotel history forward 20 years so we pay attention from the time we check in to the time we check out as far as service goes and cleanliness of the hotel. It all starts with a valet drive attendant because that’s the first person you see. The front desk people were all very friendly and pleasant and checked us in a timely manner.  Every single housekeeper we passed in the morning on our floor always say good morning to us! All of the staff in the restaurant that we ate at were exceptional. Great service all the way around will definitely come back
40,The entry was too confusing for my Uber driver which made me late & the checking was uninviting and difficult to reschedule my booking. The casino was cheap on winnings and the bell guy was amazing! Thankfully
50,Always love to stay at Mandalay Bay I stay with my family so many times and always have a great experience rooms were clean and fresh smell always only Refrigrator have no room for my food I bring from out side it was full of their stuff and I don’t wanna touch anything and get surprised after my trip lol
10,The room smelled like feet when asked house keeping she stated she cleaned to the best of her abilities. The restroom contained pee in it. The trash in bathroom was not thrown out. Also PLEASE check your fridges! They will charge you for previous checkin’s usage. Their staff is rude and stay the hell away from HOUSE OF BLUES so rude and problematics. I thought I was at a Motel 6 it was sooo bad
50,We had an exceptional stay for five nights. The hotel is very nice and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly even when dealing with rude guests (which we unfortunately observed one time). While it’s at the end of the strip it was perfect for us since we don’t like the crowds in the middle of the strip. There were still plenty of people gambling etc. especially during the football weekends. We will definitely go back soon!
40,Crappy view. Long lines at cash cages and no availability at restaurants. More staff could greatly improve experience. Valet was nice and efficient. Never had a chance to try any food at hotel. Pool was nice.
50,Got married Saturday arrived Sunday and I did mobile check in and that was so very easy. Was able to see running room balance and even MLife rewards points and free play straight through the app. Also checkout and bag service. Everything was so easy. Not much luck gambling but will go back and try again soon.
10,Horrible Check In experience with no signage for Self Parking. Valet Parking $60. No signs in Delano Parking Garage directing us back to Mandalay Bay- lots of bad directions took us 45 minutes to get to Check In. Paid for Early Check in and didn't get in to room until nearly 4 PM. MGM app not working when we tried to check out took my husband nearly 20 minutes because QR code would not work and when I asked for assistance they kept trying to get me to download the app again but the app would not work. The room was beautiful the view stupendous the bathtub great and individuals were very helpful. But for $374 for one night I'll go elsewhere next time.
50,Every little detail was perfect. Absolutely nothing upsetting happened during our stay. All personnel were committed personable and very friendly. Check in a breeze room terrific common areas clean and very enjoyable
30,The place was heaving for The Rolling Stones concert. The room was great. Large. Recently redecorated. Clean and comfortable. But wow. $600 (plus resort fee) for a room that was only $60 the next week. And you have to pay for in room coffee. And don’t even think about putting something in their fridge ($50) - We didn’t.
40,Considering the hotel was renovated so recently I expected a little more verve from the rooms. The size was enormous and the soaking tub was very luxurious. My room had a floor lamp that was barely standing upright a crooked TV and an electronics panel that was literally falling out of the wall. These things should be checked before bringing in guests. That said the room was enormous and comfortable the value was excellent and the front desk service was extremely polite and welcoming. Considering the astonishingly good price I was willing to overlook some of the room issues- but I would encourage MB to keep an eye out; because other customers paying higher rates will likely not be so forgiving. The on property restaurants are tasty though expensive. The location is a bit remote for the strip and having to pass through Luxor and Excalibur is a pain (both have definitely seen better days). I also liked that you had access to the Delano’s restaurants and bars which in some cases were of an even higher caliber.
50,Room darkening shades fast & efficient elevators beautiful grounds lots of choices of eateries huge bathroom with large tub and lots of slot machines. Loved the separate spot for Ride Shares. Had a wonderful stay here the last 3 nights.
50,We were on the 58th floor. We were able to view the entire strip. The house of blues was great 👍. The aquarium was really neat. The landscaping was awesome throughout the entire property. Located exactly on the strip.
50,From the cleanliness of everything at the resort to the friendliness of the staff; this place should not be looked over. Everything on premises was convenient to access and service was always great. Can’t wait to return again in the near future
50,The trip was amazing hotel was clean staff was friendly and the view was awesome. The aquarium is a great place to relax with the kids or even just to visit to relax from all the chaos. Out hotel room was beautiful and I’m looking forward to visiting again soon
50,We got this room free through the myVegas app and thought maybe they'd give us a low class room but it was spectacular! We had a view of the coliseum very comfortable bed clean and the casino was great too!
50,First let me say after reading so many negative reviews I was a little apprehensive. This place was great. Check in was easy. Everyone is friendly. This was our first stay at Mandalay Bay. The only negative is being away from the other casinos but we knew that going in. Drink service was quick the room was spotless. Don’t let the negative reviews discourage you. Fun place with good paying machines. Many restaurant choices. Hours are still limited at some because of staffing but plenty of choices. Housekeeping was very accommodating with special requests such as extra toiletries and towels.
10,Our time started with seeing many people stuck on the elevators. Guests were using the app to access the elevators and could not swipe. Lucky for us we had a card and could help them get to their rooms. Our bathroom area and toilet still had brown stains on it and seeped water at the floor. We also lost TV service for two of the three days we stayed. Maintenance was sent up by guest services and they could not get the issue resolved. Guest services was supposed to comp the night we had issues but only covered a resort fee for one night even though the issues persisted two days. Bringing any issue to guest services during our stay seemed like a hassle instead of staff ready to help. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless something changes.
50,Clean convenient and great staff!! Everything you need is all conveniently located within walking distance. Fabulous restaurants that were staffed with friendly team members. The shops were nice and the walkway to the stadium made going to the game simple.
50,My husband and I enjoyed every bit of our stay from the staffs nice clean room and the whole trip was well deserved. Definitely recommend this hotel for sure plus it’s good walking distance to other hotels
40,Good hotel and friendly staff. My room was not very clean........ The hotel is set up well and easy to get in and out of. Lots of restaurants to choose from. It seemed that the hotel in general was fairly clean with the exception of my room.
20,The resort was very formal and the price reflected that. Most of the bars were unnecessarily formal except for House of Blues. In addition make sure that if you are entitled to any discounts that you make that clear before you make any purchases. The resort is unable to apply any of those once the purchase is made which doesn't make a lot of sense to me and should be fixed.
40,Mandalay bay has a modern look and feel. The onsite beach is a great place to hangout. The conference center is separate from the rooms which gives a quiet environment for our stay. The venue is easy access from the airport as it is at the start of the strip.
50,We had a Great time! The check-in process was quick and easy. The staff was always friendly and extremely helpful. Such a beautiful property with a large selection of shoppes and restaurants. I would recommend staying here to anyone.
20,You could hear everything going on outside the room. The walls are paper thin. Hard to get any sleep at this casino. The tiles on shower are brownish and moldy. Employees on the floor are super friendly and helpful though. I’d go back only because of the restaurant employees and floor people.
50,I had booked 2 rooms at the Mandalay Bay due it's proximity to Allegiant Stadium. The checki in process was easy. The rooms we're clean. 1 room had TV problems but it was fixed the day. The car valet service worked perfect.
30,Sent notes to hotel on room cleanliness missing ironing board cover Aquafina charged as premium water and charged $26+ for beef and broccoli without rice as noted on menu. For the prices charged/paid doubt I’d stay again
50,Me and my family had a great time at Mandalay Bay everyone there seemed to be very well trained with great service.Me and my family would definitely recommend it to any one looking for a great place when coming to Las Vegas
30,The casino wasn't the cleanest with smoke permeating the air. Everything way over priced. Didnt live up to expectations.They charge $50 pp just to go to the rooftop bar. Drinks overpriced. No perks like free coffee in room. You pay for every little thing.
30,great hotel but i didn't get the rate I was promised. disappointed disappointed disappointed food good - casino kind of cold staff wish there was more clarity on the rate at check in disappointed i will avoid the problem in the future
50,This was our first stay and wont be our last. Perfect place to stay if your going over to Allegiant Stadium for a game. Great restaurants and the staff behind the bar at the House of Blues was awesome!!! Oh the Michael Jackson Show was awesome too!
50,We have just stayed at Mandalay Bay. Nothing is too much trouble. Check in experience was faultless. All staff are highly attentive polite and professional. We had a wonderful strip view with a comfy bed. We'd highly recommend Mandalay Bay. Thank you VIP mlife services for looking are us so well. The scheme is brilliant.
20,Had booked wellness King. Asked front desk if there was a higher floor room was given a regular king room on 12th floor. Elevators indicated wellness rooms on higher floors. Room was old; mold in shower; one hand towel provided for 2 people; no wash cloths; no wine glasses - when called room service advised of $9.00 charge plus $1.00 per glass.
50,The only complaint I had was that the water park was only open from 9-5. If you are in Las Vegas for a conference that time frame makes it very hard to enjoy the pool facilities. Please consider making the pool hours more flexible.
50,Easy to park check in experience nice with app and friendly staff. Had not been in several years but the place looked great. Also the staff was very friendly and helpful. The check in process and parking Is easy if you download the app. Will stay again.
40,when I made my reservation I had the option to choose one that needed to have wheel chair access I do not need this My room had it anyways they fold out chair in the shower made the shower feel small and water got all over the bathroom floor so not ideal.
50,Enjoyable Stay  Great Performance Venues  Comfortable Walking Distance to Meeting/Convention Spaces  Great Restaurants  Clean Quarters  Excellent Point-of-Contact Staffing  Easy Access to the LV Raiders Stadium
50,VIP arrival and check in well worth the money. Hotel was clean with great staff guests and energy throughout the stay. We ate at several of the restaurants and they all were great. Highly recommend Mandalay Bay.
40,Mandala Bay is perfectly located for fans going to an event at Allegient Stadium. Room was clean pillows are great. No fridge for personal items (just an automatic mini bar) and had to ask for washcloths each night as housekeeping does not leave them in the room. We were placed in the wrong room type for our 3 night stay so they offered to “comp our resort fees and give a $100 food/beverage credit.” I confirmed this before agreeing to stay in the smaller room but upon checkout they did not want to honor this. After speaking to her manager the lady rudely stated the manager had approved my request.
30,The room was dirty and no microwave or refrigerator for personal stuff. No ice bags one wash cloth no trash bags and the shower and tub was dirty. The pillows were like clouds great night sleep. The Wi-Fi wasn’t so good maybe because the traffic in and out. The parking is so far away from the hotel if u choose to self park. This was my first trip ever Vegas was fun but I will stay in another facility next time or ask more questions before checking in.
30,There was nothing major wrong definitely nothing special. There was always a lengthy wait to get hold of anyone in Guest Relations Concierge Bell Desk or other for assistance. Staff could have been much more helpful.
50,Everyone we dealt with was fantastic! From check-in/check-out dinners at Stripsteak (get the rib cap) and Citizens were fantastic as usual! Just a blast clean spacious rooms and wouldn’t hesitate to return. See you soon!
40,Nice views and room but key might not work all the time. Takes forever for Maintenence or someone to bring towels. Housekeeping asked if we wanted our room cleaned and we said no but all we needed was a new set of towels. She said sorry you have to call front desk for that which we already did an hour prior but no one came. We then begged for our old towels to be taken instead of staying g on the floor so she allowed us to drop them in her cart. I also asked for a trash bag and she just pointed to her cart for me to throw my own trash out so I grabbed my trash can and showed her thinking she would throw it but she pointed again for me to throw it myself. I thought it was rude. Anyway towels never came so 4 hours later I called front desk again and finally someone brought them up.
50,I stayed at the Mandalay Bay for 5 days to attend the IMEX convention. So glad I did b/c it was a short walk to the convention center. Loved that my room was spacious and exceptionally clean which is a must. I also had a beautiful view from the 15th floor. Wish the pool was open a little later so I could have taken advantage of it but overall LOVED the Mandalay Bay and will definitely be back.
50,We loved our stay here !! Nothing negative to say at all !!! The hotel was beautiful and clean ! Sum hotels are kinda ghetto and Mandalay Bay definitely was not that ! We will definitely be back at sum point in near future!!
10,There was hair in the bathroom tub and shower of our room. Staff sent house keeping to the room 3 times to clean and every time they did not clean the tub or shower. There were pubic hairs and hair in both.
40,Hotel was okay time for an upgrade/renovation. Certain things are broken like towel hooks. The biggest issue is how thin the walls are I could hear my neighbour's alarm and his conversations all day.
10,During check-in Kim at the front desk was rude. The room was outdated the AC unit was loud and there was hair in shower. Overall if you can stay somewhere else you should. Nothing to rave about this hotel.
40,Loved the view from our room on one of the top floors. Front Desk Staff were amazing and helpful. Rooms/Hotel/Casino were clean. It is a little far from the main strip area. Dinning options were excellent!
40,VERY long lines at Valet VERY long wait for breakfast and coffee. The hotel is ridiculously under staffed !! You pay resort fees but unable to use them (pool services lack coffee shop closed). You pay $30/day for valet but there is no one there and you wait 20 minutes for them to take your key !! Not worth it !
30,Many places were not open for dinning on a Saturday. Coins were not given when redeeming winnings. The amount of money paid was not worth for the limited service available at the Hotel. We had in room dining and.asked for cream and sugar and only got sweetener with black coffee.
20,They do not care about what room you booked and paid for. They will just stick you in any room that is currently available. Our room wasn't serviced like you'd expect any hotel to. Only the wave pool was available to use. Can't believe they charge this massive resort fee when we can't use one of their main attractions. Overall will not be back.
50,First time staying at Mandalay Bay and it won’t be the last. I stayed in a penthouse suite and got to see the MJOne show. It was awesome and they have all the amenities you could think of. I’m big on cleanliness and the room was clean and comfortable.
40,Reserved 3 rooms for a bachelor party months in advance and requested the rooms be near each other. One of the rooms ended up being in a completely different elevator. Very inconvenient considering you need a key to get the floor. This causes additional problems as it seemed that 1 out of the 2 key scanner in each elevator was broken. Other than that rooms and casino were nice.
40,I advise anyone that reads this review USE the check in app. I avoided the long lines for check-in by using the MGM app. I arrived and went to straight to my room using my phone as a digital key!! This feature gets two thumbs up!    The room was rather dark... Definitely could use more lighting. I kept my blinds closed be my view was the huge AC compressor on the roof. I was on the third floor :(    Bathroom was supersized and well lit.    MGM should at least offer HBO or Showtime  WiFi could be better.... I have trouble everytime I wanted to have internet. I at times used my phone as a hotspot... For the cost the WiFi should be lightyears in speed.
50,I was there to participate in a tournament. The hotel exceeded my expectations. Staff was helpful and friendly. The room was clean and beautiful. Bed was comfortable and roomy. I recommend this hotel and will stay there again.
40,Need more seating in pool area. Fix the handrail in the hot tub. Wish you had seating in the lobby when checking in.  A water fountain for water bottle would be amazing this place is in the desert and we need to stay hydrated people!! But did you die?!
50,It is more reasonable to stay M-F but worth the money over a weekend! The shark reef was ok and not as fascinating as I anticipated but for the little ones it might be worth it. Check out Citizens to get mid range $ food. Make reservations as soon as you book your trip by contacting the restaurant direct. OpenTable is not always sharing the reservation with the restaurant.
10,The coffee in your room May cost you 30$. The room key didn’t work several times. The front office has long lines. You might have to wait 15/20 mins to make your key work the digital keys are just useless.
50,Was in town for brother’s wedding. Rooms were very comfortable and well appointed. Only small complaint is that the shower dripped continually and there were no wash clothes in bathroom. Beautiful clean well appointed resort convenient to the airport. All the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful. Strip Steak restaurant was exceptional. Try the pear martini! You won’t regret it!
50,Consistently Mandalay Bay offers an exceptional resort stay option on the strip. Rooms entertainment amenities food… all top notch. Access to the additional shops and restaurants between MGM hotels makes for a fun memorable destination.
50,You want 4 things in a hotel: clean rooms comfortable beds feather pillows good water pressure in the shower. The rest is just window dressing. Mandalay Bay wins in all 4 except the water pressure. It was incredibly anemic. Of course there is a drought so I cant complain too much. Overall an excellent stay at a beautiful property
50,My first time in Vegas as Mandalay Bay was a perfect hotel to stay.From checking in to checking out it was excellent even our housekeeper Mary was doing a great job i will definitely staying here again
30,"Room was fine but it wasn't what was booked confirmed or expected. We booked a king bed room but they put us in double queens and put a tag on the account as ""do not move"" and they over sold the the king rooms. This was booked through hotels.com so I believe the reservation was not honored."
50,We especially love the bathroom. Toilet and standing shower are separated and the bath tub fells luxurious. The size of sink and the lighted mirror is awesome! I feel like im really staying in a very fancy hotel
50,Me and my wife had a wonderful time at your resort and we look to come back again. We had fun at aquarium the restaurants and the overall in environment with helpful and pleasant staff.  We've shared experiences and pictures with our friends and family which can bring you guys future business.
50,Great stay with my tamily i only eiah the lazy river was open bur everywhere 2qe clean and safe i like everything there does fun and drinking lots of fun we will stay again there soon it was excellent rooom
30,Rooms ok. No body was or bath soap offered-just one small bar of soap and only one set of towels  Food options at pool limited and very expensive and not all looks or food outlets open  Smoke in casino permeates restaurants which really impacts the experience.
50,I stayed at the hotel for The Rolling Stones concert. Best location on the strip for an event at Allegiant Stadium. Very walkable. Great meals at Veranda Noodle Shop and Lupo. Easy betting at sports book. Great accessible blackjack tables! Stay here!
50,The place was awesome as expected from Mandalay the pools were all open except one. Not sure why maybe VIP section didn’t ask. It wasn’t hot enough for hours at the pool but  nice enough for few drink and some food at the Grill.  The room was still very modern not sure if it’s been renovated or not . But bed was comfortable . Restroom clean and staff overall was pretty nice … not too crowded as getting closer to holidays but so fun and great deal I think at about 120 a night . They did charge for parking and feel it’s ridiculous but MGM charges all all its Hotels should be free for guest but I guess they want more money .
50,We really enjoyed ourselves at the Mandalay Bay. It was such a beautiful casino hotel and the room was so spacious and relaxing. We had a strip view and we loved it. It was in close proximity to everything on the strip.
40,Maybe it's the same with all casino hotels but the smell of smoking in the casino was obnoxious. Even when wearing a mask the scent of cigarette smoke was horrible. I wouldn't return for this very reason.
50,We have stayed at Mandalay Bay for our last several trips to Vegas as they won us over with their wonderful strip views room cleanliness and comfort customer service and the ease of getting around to the other resorts and they didn't disappoint this time either highly recommend.
20,Reserved king room received queen room. Didn’t want to give discount eventually gave fee credit… room was average tub seem to have pee in it. Wife cleaned tub again wasn’t as good as when we stayed before. Complete let down
10,I usually tolerate the overpriced hotels and food in Vegas because at least the quality is high. Mandalay Bay? Nope. This is the first time I have stayed here. WiFi bumps you out every 30 seconds. And you can’t get Verizon reception in the guest room. I have not stayed in a hotel where it was impossible to get on line since AOL in the 90s. Even the lobby bar system was down and they could not take credit cards. Oh and my key did not work after walking a 1/4 mile to the room and I had to go back to the front desk. Apparently this is very common as I heard the same complaint from others in my group.    Then there is the $12 instant coffee in the room. The planes taking off are loud. The windows were dirty. The casino ventilation is not great. The lobby bar did not provide itemized receipts. Everything seems like a rip off. $5 waters. 🙄    I’ll deal with the cabs and stay anywhere else next year. I really disliked this hotel.    This hotel is the worst value in Vegas.
30,First Hotel I’ve ever stayed out where they charge you an arm and leg just for coffee in your room. They sell them in kits and the kids are a whopping $12 unreal! They also don’t provide you housekeeping service. Not sure if you need to request it… Wouldn’t know as they did not notify me of this
10,Used to be a good hotel- stayed many times at THEHotel at the Mandalay Bay. They forgot what service is! It's time to understand that being OK is not good enough! I will never stay at this hotel again. There are so many other hotels in Vegas to stay why to stay in just OK?!
20,This property was excellent 10 years ago. It’s so sad to see that it hasn’t been properly maintained. We won’t be coming back. The money grab has become ridiculous. Everything is offensively overpriced
50,I have been in the Hotel Industry for over 25 years at upscale brand hotels and The Mandalay Bay was superb. The Lupo by Wolfgang Puck restaurant was freaking amazing and we dined there two consecutive nights.    As we were checking out I noticed that the snack bar in the room was not full and it looked as if there were a few items missing. Per Covid several hotels has cut back with in-room amenities. Therefore I did take a picture and shared it with Melissa D-MB Front Desk and she assured me that there were 2-3 items missing. Melissa did give us a credit on our invoice which was so kind of her. Melissa is perfect for the hospitality industry as she listen empathized apologized and solved the issue (LEAP).    Thank you to Mandalay Management for hiring professional people.    LM
50,With everything that is going on in our lives right now we needed to recharge! It was a perfect place to relax have drinks eat great food and enjoy our favorite machines! Music food drinks and love! Awesome quick trip! Just because!
10,The tv didn’t work. They put us on completely different floors when asked for joining you have to make your own room keys. No where near anything. Don’t tell you about their own tram system or explain the elevator system. You are basically left to figure it out.
50,Mandalay Bay exceeds you're expectations! From the moment you pull up you're dealing with friendly staff. The Casino is spacious and clean. It's not like others that feel like you're shoulder to shoulder. The restaurants are great...they also have a food court if your looking for cheaper eats. The room was amazing! The view was amazing! The pool area is amazing!If you're coming to Vegas you won't be disappointed if you choose Mandalay Bay. Don't worry about the location either. They have a tram that takes you to Excalibur and you're right by New York New York...short walk and you're in the heart of the strip....two thumbs up for me!! Will stay here time and time again!
50,Great location with all the required amenities in one location. Pool is awesome and there are multiple fantastic dinning options on site. Located at the end of the Las Vegas Strip decreases the craziness on the casino floor
20,Went for our first trip since covid. We used to llove this hotel. No more! Terrible customer service . Go elsewhere. It started w check in. Even though I booked a month in advance it took jeffrey over 1/2 hr to check us into 2 rooms. The other agents had checked in 3 or 4 families and we were still waiting. I asked for the agent next to him to check us into the second room bc jeffry said his computer software crashed….but jeffrey wouldn’t let him and the managers sitting behind him didn’t seem to care one single bit. Now that was just wrong. Also I asked for a free upgrade to a strip view for my husbands 70th bday. He didn’t even look at his DL and insisted no free upgrades for anyone….period. No discussion. I’m a world traveler and know that is not true. Also was told by Mandalay agents on the phone I could get an upgrade for his birthday if rooms were available ( and they were). Meanwhile. I heard another agent give a free upgrade to a higher floor and a strip view for no extra cost to another couple. After 40 minutes we finally get keys and are off to elevator. NONE of the keys work to get us to our floor in elevator. Thanks a lot jeffrey. Back to front desk for new keys bc jeffrey is incompetent. pLEASE FIRE JEFFREY!!! Up to our room…crappy view of McDonald’s. Sign. The Champaign I ordered for bday came late and NOT in a bucket of ice ….odd? The I ice bucket in the room is too small for the champagne we ordered. Try to call guest services….good luck….you are on hold for at least 15 minutes and then just give up. I couldn’t get through until Sunday night and we checked in Friday……. Next customer service disaster was the spa. Booked two massages for my 2 sons again several days in advance. They charged my son for 2 massages took my one son in. Then told my other son they overbooked and could only offer to give him a 20 minute foot massage instead!! Really!!! Obviously taking advantage of young men in their 20s. Overbooked??? They said they would not charge for either massage…but when my son got home they did charge him for one massage. I emailed the director at the spa and am still waiting for a response or even an apology. It’s been more than a week and nothing. Terrible. DONT GO TO THIS SPA!! We went to Venetian for same price the next day and were treated really well there. Canyon Ranch. The restaurants at Mandalay Bay close early so no where to eat if you r a late night gambler. No more buffet here either. The only time I was treated like a paying guest was at our pool cabana we rented for $400 day. Shout out to manny and Kimberly who took great care of us and even tried to resolve our spa problems. They were the only people at the hotel who seemed to care about customer service……I’m a long time M Lufe member. Had not gone to Vegas bc of covid….but next time I will stay Anywhere Else. But here! This hotel should be ashamed of how we were treated but I doubt they will even read this. Also I write many reviews. This is my first really negative review of any hotel.
40,We stayed in a standard room. Room was nice and roomy. Very clean and the bathroom had a soaking tub with a separate shower which was a perk. Room service closes early which lame but over all our stay was great! I def recommend the Mandalay Bay.
50,Went to Mandalay Bay for a convention. Expected a routine Vegas experience but was blown away by the friendliness and comfort of the hotel. Stay was pleasant. Excellent food options and entertainment. It was amazing
50,When I arrived to the hotel my room was not ready. However I waited in the lobby which was bright and airy. I relax by the window that had a great view. Needless to say I didn’t wait that long before I was notified my room was ready. My room was nice and clean. I was 100% satisfied with my stay. I will add the customer service was amazing. Definitely will stay here again😆
50,Mandalay Bay was awesome! friendly staff and clean casino room was spacious and had a great view we ate at libertine social and the house of blues the food was terrific we ate breakfast there my wife can't wait to go back
50,This hotel lives up to the hype. Outstanding rooms very nicely updated. The pool area is amazing with outstanding servers. The casino is very nice. Room prices are reasonable for the quality of the hotel. If you are an MLife member you can likely get comped rooms fairly easily during the week.
50,Easy and quick check in. We dropped off our bags early since it was hours before check in. Staff were very professional and friendly. Rooms were excellent. Would recommend and would definitely stay again.
50,First trip back to Vegas MGM hotels are working to bring back the fun. We stayed at Mandalay Bay and had a blast - sports book (with a great new app for betting) food drinks games and all-around wonderful vibe. MGM is really doing it with style. We will be back.
50,The time spent at Mandalay was fantastic as well as the guest and the room. Everything went according to my plan while staying there and nothing bad came out of this trip with Mandalay. I will be a returning customer as always!
40,We were treated great by the hotel staff. We have stayed at the hotel on several occasions and have always had a great experience. Our recent visit was for four nights and never had to leave the property for anything.
50,I am actually reviewing the MandaLee Bay; most comfortable air mattress with fluffed pillows state-of-the-art infrastructure fast elevator complimentary soju complimentary Kirkland bottled water large-screen high definition television that carries all major sporting network providers including ESPN-Plus a one-of-a-kind feature from an MGM-based property. Additionally all mobile sports wagering licensees are available at this establishment only as bettors have access to make deposits and withdrawals directly from their mobile devices as opposed to physically making these transactions at the retail sports book locations.    MandaLee’s reward system excels above all properties on Las Vegas Boulevard and ownership will directly accommodate any and all needs. Whether one stays for business or leisure MandaLee provides an unforgettable experience and I look forward to returning in the immediate future.
10,Business trip. The staff was very prejudice on check-in. Allowing white guest and families to check in before me even though I’ve been at the hotel for hours. No one cared about my luggage well being or if I would have a place to stay after I already booked lodge at the manadalay. Months before my arrival.
30,Nice place to stay but room service wasn’t the best. Stayed here before and had a great experience but this time not so much. Our room didn’t get cleaned in 2 days we had to use dirty towels and no toiletries were left we had to go out to but shampoo and soap.
50,May be towards the end of the strip…I see it as a start to the adventure. Easy to get around in Vegas then come “home” to a great place. I’ll take that on any trip! The winning at this casino is also great. The food is great and close.
20,Our room was dirty. For example there was visible grime and dirty hand prints on all doors and closets around the handles/knobs. High touch surfaces were obviously not being cleaned and sanitized. No toilet paper roll holder. Bathroom door was misaligned and would not close and the handle on the bathroom door was broken. You pay a small fortune to stay there but you can’t use the in-room fridge to keep your food and drinks cold without being charged an extra $50 per stay. Seriously? EVERYTHING is expensive. A small bottle of pop from the store … over $7.
50,Wendy and Erin were wonderful for the wedding. Great overall stay thank you to the staff and event planners for making this happen. Me and my new wife are very thankful for a job well done. Food and DJ were awesome too
50,One of my best experience at thise casino will definitely come back soon to celebrate my anniversary  With my wife good place to bring my family we will start planning our next trip soon my wife it’s really happy with e service as well
50,We have stayed at Mandalay Bay many times. We love this resort and would recommend. It never bothers us that it is at the end of the strip. The only thing different we noticed this time was how busy it was after the Stones concert. Have never seen it so busy not even on a long weekend.
10,Booked a king bed was given 2 queen bed instead. House keeper comes in the room early with barely a knock or waiting for anyone to answer. (She has no idea who checked out).  Lastly I was charge parking 2x.
30,"Prepaid for parking and was told our room key would get us in and out of the garage - -it didn't. Trapped and needing to make a golf tee time we paid to get out (even though we prepaid). Attempted to resolve and was told by front desk that our phone should have been used (no one told us that). Tried the next day - -still couldn't get out. Had to contact the ""control center"" who told me to ""calm down"" even though I wasn't yelling or cursing. Also walked away from a restaurant due to a rude hostess and dined off property. The elevators annoyed everyone - -you have to use your room key for your specific floor - -imagine an elevator full of people all trying to tap their key car near the door at the same time - -the elevator would go and there was always someone who got missed and had to ride up and down to get to their floor. Spa is wonderful and had a great massage and it is very convenient to the Allegiant Stadium but there are issues at this property."
20,Forget it find another property..  the room I reserved was not avalible and the two bed room they put me in was lousy. Aconnecting door with extreemly oud people next door. I had to be moved after the first night.
40,Property pool area staff all first-rate. Location of course is at the far south end of the strip but I knew that going in (primary reason for the trip was a show at the House of Blues. Not a cheap hotel so I don't know why we were nickel and dimed to death. Yeah it's Vegas but charging (a lot) for in room coffee?
50,Another great weekend away with good friends.  The Mandalay Bay never disappoints!  The staff pool cabanas restaurants and our two bedroom suite were as always perfect.  Our dining experience at Rivea was excellent! Kudo's to the management!  Looking forward to a return trip soon.
20,Staff at check in was friendly and helpful no problems there. The players club and M life desk was a problem the entire trip there were never any staff around after check in when at the desk that was marked players club after being in line 20 minutes because there was only one staff member I was told I had to use the M life desk which didnt make sense to me but I went to the M life desk after another 10 minutes in line I was able to get my players card when asking them about my included F&B $50 credit and $50 free play they said I had to go back to the previous players club line which was really frustrating the desks were right next to each other only feet apart at the same counter but even after explaining that I was just in that line they told me I had to go to the back of the 20 plus person line and start the whole process over I was ready to get my vacation started and after being in line for 30 plus minutes I decided to just come back later which resulted in a 20 plus person line every time with none or 1 to 2 staff members the last time I went to wait in line was Saturday night at 10 p.m. I was never able to get the included free play an F&B credit as a result of this on top of all of this I have stayed at nearly all of the MGM properties multipule times over the years and have always been happy with my stay I am also a part of the M life master card program and have plenty of reward credit to pay for the entire trip but when checking out I was told I clould not use the rewards credit for the room stay and would have to go talk to the rewards desk about it and had no other information to help me. Since I hade to get to the airport for my flight I ended up paying for the entire trip out of pocket instead of using the credit I had been working on to use for the trip after all the problems we encountered I will not be staying at this property and really do not recommend it specificly for the staff I have decided I might try another loyalty program as well
50,A beautiful clean and friendly place to stay. I traveled for a quick trip to attend a conference at the Mandalay Bay convention center and didn't have to leave the property for anything. Well done to the cooks at Fleur! Best steak I've had in a while.
40,Location to stadium is AMAZING (5 min walk) pools were great bringing kids next time. Didn’t like the extra cost of daily parking but it was nice to actually have a parking spot close to the elevators every time (maybe the cost of parking keeps the free-parkers out).
50,Had a great stay! Awesome amenities location and really nice rooms and bathrooms. We weren't facing the strip but the view was still great. Loved digital check in and digital room key though would recommend getting a physical key for use in the elevators. Wish we could have stayed longer.
10,Do not go to this property with high expectations….Many times the rooms are not cleaned properly… last time we stayed there there was no glasses in the room so if you want to have a drink of anything or need to take medication you will be out of luck. For the second time this year the icemaker on our floor did not work and it was never fixed. The clientele of this property not the most reputable classy people you probably would want to be around. I think there are far too many choices on the strip to have to stay at a property that does not value their guests whatsoever.
50,Great overall stay. Great room great price great service. Everything was clean quiet and relaxing.  So glad we stayed. The property has so much to offer. We would love to come and stay again and stay longer.
30,Online checkin/ checkout malfunctioning. Room TV mostly non functional and alarm clock kept ringing and would not shut off even after being ripped from the wall plug! For 2 days we could hear it buzzing from the closet!
10,We paid an exorbitant amount for our room. The entire trip we felt like we were being ripped off. We don’t mind paying more if the service and amenities match the cost. We had an average room which needed attention. There was mild in the shower dust on the furniture the door handle to the bathroom was broken and would not close all the way. The toilet paper holder was missing the holder and the toilet paper was sat on the back off the toilet. No corkscrew in the room. I went to desk to ask for one and was told if they brought me one up to the room it would cost me $20 and suggested I buy one instead. We could not put drinks in the fridge. We were told it was weight sensitive and if we removed anything to put our own drinks in we would be charged $50 for use of the fridge. There was coffee in the room but you had to pay $4.50 for it. EVERYTHING in the hotel was outrageously overpriced. Bought a soda in the store for $7.50. We went for a nice family trip and did not feel the hotel provided any level of comfort or service as should have been the case for what we paid. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. I’m confident you can find a better price to service match than we did.
40,Stayed at the Mandalay Bay last week. Would have given a 5 but the coffee was a cheep shot.    Nice clean quiet room. Great service. Enjoyed our time! Saw the Michael Jackson One Show. Visited the Shark exhibit. Ate in many of the restaurants.    In room Keurig machines and cups w pods creamer and sweeteners. No price on this item so assumed (wrong!) that they were complimentary (as in most other hotels). $12!!! For the cup/pod set up. No menu of mini bars prices or indication that the coffee was not free. SHOCKING is an understatement. Do not drink the coffee. Not even good. $12. Ridiculous.
10,I called the reservation desk for my reservation. I got two king bed rooms and was told to check-in in person when I arrived. I was told to not use the app as it would place our two rooms far apart. I flew in at 5 PM & went straight to the hotel front desk. I was promptly told my rooms were not available as they had been sold. I had a confirmation number with my reservation. I was told by the front desk staff that they start checking in people at 11 and my rooms had been taken. Why take a reservation if you sell out the room? Isn't that part of the reservation process? The holding on the reservation? It was like a Seinfeld episode. I ended up with two queen rooms for my 15 year anniversary and my friends birthday. Not ideal for couple get away with no kids.
50,My boyfriend and I came in for a long weekend. We purchased the VIP arrival experience and it was well worth the $250. Our driver was waiting for us at the airport and we were picked up on time as well for our return. There is a special VIP lounge to check in complimentary wine and beer and coffee. In addition you can have your bags picked up from your room and stored/transported to the car. It was a pleasure. In addition the sports book staff were patient and helpful and helped us sign up for the MGMbet app. The pool is amazing and the lazy river runs quickly. Loved the hotel and tram to other casinos.
50,Our flight was canceled and we checked in at 2:30 am with late checkout to get some rest for our flight the next evening at 11pm. The staff was very helpful room was beautiful and clean Pools were wonderful Food and entertainment were top notch!
40,"The issue with all strip hotels is that they charge quite a bit on certain days and they charge a ""resort fee"" that you seldom use. The floor vending machine did not work. TV reception on some channels was spotty(freezing). These details matter when you are paying premium money on the weekend. The hotel was clean and the food was good."
50,Mandalay is an excellent resort at the very end of the strip. With the allegiant center across the freeway this looks like it will be a major resort for years to come. Good selection of tables restaurants activities...no reason to leave ;P
50,Fantastic resort amazing food and awesome entertainment. Can not miss this place! Large rooms with comfy beds. Staff that go out of there way. Lots of things to see. This is the only place I stay at strip.
10,"TV didn't work even after an engineer came up to ""reboot"" the TV. Couldn't check out on the TV; The toilet was a small cubicle with an automatic slamming door on it; the shower head was awful; used towels were not replaced; and nobody cared a bit - before and after checkout. The clerk did say she was sorry about that. Need I say more?"
50,The resort was amazing the dining options were endless staff was friendly and helpful. The bed was comfy everything was conveniently located in the resort restaurants were great. You didn't have to go far for anything.
50,10-15 minute walk to Allegiant Stadium. Always top notch hotel. Great staff easy check in restaurants open nice rooms. Hotel fees are outrageously expensive per day. Coffee in-room now but $12/cup.
10,Hotel rooms are nice but bathrooms are cleaned poorly. Amenities are minimal and whatever amenities are available incur fees for using them. No microwave or usable fridge valet is expensive slow and rude. Resort fees are on par with other hotels that are in the middle of the strip. The rooms are cheap but the fees you’ll be paying bring it back up to actual resort pricing. I’ve stayed at the vdara and can honestly say I’ll be coughing up the extra $30-$50 a night to stay there from now on.
30,When we got to our room and unpacked I noticed we had a large bathtub in the master bathroom. When I got closer I could see pubic hairs in the tub. Whoever cleaned the room either didn’t clean the tub or they did a very poor job cleaning!
20,"VIP had a change 2 months ago that is you don't have a host do everything for you then you cant use them. So even if you qualify and continue to gamble well that only want you if you want to work with a host. I was asked to step outside to check in though I clearly qualified to use the check in. The attitudes of ""We don't want you here"" are amazing."
50,From the moment you walk in and smell the fragrance being pumped thru the ventilation you feel like your in an island in the desert.  great comfortable hotel and casino is easy to get around and bright
40,I enjoyed my stay. My only complaint is that i was there 7 nights and my room was only serviced 3.    Great hotel. Location isn't optimal at the end of the strip but hey; there's always the tram :)    Convention center was good as well.
50,On the Best Hotel I've ever stayed in Las Vegas.  I was in Las Vegas for the Rolling Stone concert. I enjoyed every second in Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino. My experience from the check in moment to the check out was excellent. RiRa bar offers a great ambience for mature people like me. Then Eye Candy was the perfect spot to chat with my colleagues during this trip. Walking to the Allegiant Stadium was an unforgettable experience. The cleanliness of the room and the response to my requests from Front Desk Room Service and House Keeping didn't disappoint me at all.
50,Came here for a getaway and to see a show. Had an excellent time at the Mandalay. Staff was always friendly with great food and drinks everywhere we went. This place is located on our favorite side of the Vegas strip.
30,Watch out for add-on’s. The paper coffee cups in the room that are typically free will set you back $12 apiece. This is on top of the resort fees and parking fees that are disclosed. I guess they haven’t been making as much money in the casinos since Covid.
40,For a hotel to be so expensive there is no microwave to heat up your expensive left overs and no refrigerator to keep anything refrigerated. Even the cheaper hotels have both! It even would have been nice to pop my microwaved popcorn. But no microwave!
50,I normally stay at the Delano when attending an event at Mandalay Bay Convention Center. I was assigned to stay at the Mandalay Bay Hotel instead of the Delano. I must admit the rooms are spacious and clean. Daily housekeeping is not the norm these days but the room was cleaned every day. Very nice touch. Though mini-bar items are pricey it is convenient.
50,The property is beautiful & has direct access to Allegiant stadium. Also you can take the tram all the way to Excalibur (or walk) then cut through NYNY go to MGM and take the monorail back & forth on the strip. Even though it’s at the end of the strip it’s still simple to get to places.
50,We live in Summerlin.com & chose to stay at Mandalay Bay given its great rates and 10 minute walk to Allegiant Stadium to see The Rolling Stones. The staff was outstanding & many fine restaurants. The slots were loose and we left with a few extra dollars!
50,This suite is BEAUTIFUL! If you’re considering it do it! It’s so clean roomy and high class! We loved the stream shower and soaking tub. There’s so much space to relax or entertain. I’ve seen a lot of bad reviews and we did not have any issues. We used the digital room key on the mlife app and it worked great. We will book this suite again. Big shout out to the housekeeping staff who are working so hard to keep the rooms clean so we all can travel!!
10,So much wrong! Key card on phone so-so had to get physical cards. Mold in shower. No fan in bath areas. Vegas expensive but 3-4x retail for wine excessive. Very thin walls room too noisy. Terrible wi-fi. Mask wearing a Mirage no enforcement.
20,If you have lots of extra money to throw out the window come to Vegas. $300 extra surprise Resort Fee. Requiring an $800 deposit on your credit card. Yes that mean you can not use that money it is on Hold
50,Mandalay Bay once again provided a great experience. While the location is kind of at the far end of the strip it is a very nice-upscale experience and you don't have to deal with all the riff raff that stumbles in off the sidewalk.
50,Great access to the airport and large variety of food and entertainment options from high end restaurants to traditional Irish pub to the best view in Vegas at the Foundation Room all without having to leave the hotel.
50,Staff was Awesome. Everyone was friendly from hotel to casino. Our room was clean and the cleaning staff maintained that cleanliness throughout our stay. This was our 2nd stay at the MB and won’t be our last. This will be our home away from when in Vegas
10,Forgot expensive watch in room safe. Front desk and security refused to return my property to me until I called the police. Ginnette Montoya (front desk supervisor)was so bothered by my requests for help that we just stopped communicating with me. Nico Ariel (head of Security) yelled at me for calling the police for help “I know you called Metro and I don’t care if you stand here all night!”
50,Always enjoy my stays at Mandalay Bay. Larger rooms and bathrooms. Great pool area. I love the House of Blues for dining. The check in process was smooth sailing. The high ceilings and spaciousness of the property are appealing.
50,We loved our stay at Mandalay Bay. We have enjoyed staying at MGM resorts and this was our first time staying here.    What a great place to stay if you are attending anything at Allegiant Stadium. It is such easy access to walk over to the stadium.    The room was perfect and the choice of restaurants was amazing. So many options for whatever you are in the mood for.
50,This was our second stay this year at Mandalay Bay and we really enjoyed it...both times! Our priorities might be different than many other travelers as it wasn't the casino pool or restaurants that matter to us. Rather it's the room the convention center and the property's location on the Strip that make Mandalay Bay our first choice in Las Vegas hotels. The rooms are spacious beds comfortable and the bathrooms are large with separate shower tub and water closet. Most every night of the year we take a 3 mile walk which can be a bit of a challenge while staying in Vegas as while walking on the Strip is an adventure in and of itself. (The stop lights heat and crowds make it difficult to maintain our regular pace.) That's where the convention center comes in as we are able to wander the carpeted halls non-stop in comfortable temps without the maddening crowd. Lastly with its location at the south end of the Strip and easy access via Frank Sinatra Drive parking at Mandalay Bay is easy and convenient. We travel to Las Vegas in our personal vehicle and make several trips out during the days we are there. Not having to deal with traffic on Las Vegas Blvd. is a real plus for us. I should mention that on each of our stays at Mandalay Bay this year there has been a problem with our room. The first time we had to be re-located to another room due to flooding on a floor above us and the second time the air conditioner in our room was not working properly. While slightly inconvenient these situations were quickly remedied. We are looking forward to our next stay at Mandalay Bay!
50,The staff was amazing and the room was more then we expected unfortunately we discovered a camera in the refrigerator which I felt my privacy was validated. The parking lot was huge and well lit but again the fact that we were guest at the hotel and being locals to Nevada we still had to pay for parking.
40,We had a great time here. Didn't like coffee in the room $6/ cup. Didn't like going into the pool area and had to hand my key to an ungloved person who was touching everyone's room keys. Food was great still would go again.
50,Mandalay Bay was the best! From the friendly Front Desk personnel the spacious room and hotel cleanliness soft bed strip view Luxor and other hotels connection the pool area to the taxi cab everything was well organized and inviting.
50,First time to stay at this hotel  Easy check in with app  Clean room  Friendly and helpful staff  Clean Casino  App was very helpful  Parking was easy  Had dinner at one of the restaurants good food reasonably priced
50,As you may know Vegas on Halloween weekend can be tough to book. Mandalay Bay has a great setup (best place to stay if you’re going to watch the Raiders game) great restaurants and all at great value. Really love the unique beach/pool setup as well.
30,The hotel is centrally located to lots of great shopping and dining. However the rooms are very dated and need to be remodeled. The pool areas is fun with the beach and the service in the cabanas was great. The restaurants and shopping in the hotel were also very good. The live music at night was excellent and we really enjoyed our stay.
50,good location all staffs very kind who is I met.  Enough space between slot machines and all area is clean but I go to the room there is no soaps so I have to call room service and little expensive food price I am expected.
10,I really can't find much good to say about Mandalay Bay. I guess the staff was nice but the food was bland and overpriced (unless you are the well done steaks buried in American Cheese for outrageous sums type). Rooms are small and dingy and everything is overpriced and low quality. I don't come to Vegas much but there must be better places to stay.
10,"I checked into one room overnight I was jetlagged and couldn't wait to sleep. I jumped in the bed assuming it was clean but in the morning I noticed several stains which I know didn't come from me. One looked like a coffee stain and a few smaller black spots and a transluscent splattery stain on the pillow. I checked the other bed beside me and it had similar stains. I checked into a new room the next day and to my disbelief the beds both in the new room had similar stains and even a couple of small hairs on them. My coworker was there as well and her room's sheets also had stains and hairs. I asked for new bed sheets and I was no longer disappointed at this stage to discover more unclean bedsheets when I chcked the room upon returning. I knew this would be the case which is why I asked if I could stay in the room and watch them change the sheets to new sheets but they said no due to covid we can't have you in the room at the same time as the cleaning staff. My soap holder also had stains on it and my bathroom sink had splatters of black spots in one of the sinks (cleaning crew cleaned it after the 2nd day I was there). To make matters worse my neighbour was smoking the entire 4 days and when I complained to staff about it all I got was a ""Sorry to hear that you're experiencing that."" After having to fight for it (the first guy I spoke to initially seemed completely unconcerned about the dirty sheets until i spoke with three more staff members) they comp'ed me for one night's stay for the dirty sheets but they clearly have issues with hygiene. I'll never stay at the Mandalay Bay hotel again due to this disgusting standard and their lack of care and attention to treating customers better."
30,Stayed for two night in a two bedroom suite. Also paid for VIP lounge. Billing and service were crap. The rest was excellent and we never left the property due to the conference we were attending so we experienced a lot of departments restaurants exhibit hall conference rooms pool cabanas and other services offered.
30,I've always had pleasant experiences at the Mandalay Bay but this past trip was horrendous! The rooms are as expected clean and for the most part quiet. My less than normal review this time is due to service members specifically bell service!
10,I came to Vegas for a bachelors party. Mandalay was a familiar name that I recognized so I booked a room. While sleeping that night I felt my face itching. Only to turn on the light to see that underneath my pillow was covered in mold.  This is the most disgusting and disconcerting experience I've ever been in. I will never visit this hotel again! If you have to make sure it's a last result. We must be wary that in times such as this a CLEAN place to lay your head while experiencing leisure is of the utmost importance. Stay safe friends and safe travels. I will update this review later after while my customer service experience
30,I liked the fact that it was so big and had so many options you did not even need to leave the property. Restaurant choices were excellent.  Beach area was nice although the beverage service was lacking. If you didnt sit in the reserved section you were basically ignored and had to go get your own drink. Drinks (alcohol) were a little pricey.. 12 oz drink was $17 and 32 oz was $28.  Rooms was comfortable with an excellent view of the Strip. Bed was a little too soft for our taste.  Did like that you could walk across to Luxor without going outside or take the tram to Luxor and Excaliber.
50,We loved the qty of places to eat both in a hurry and also to entertain clients. Being connected to Expo center and Delano hotel was a plus. Signage made it easy to connect to our meeting on time. The only difficulty was getting extra chairs for our suite for our guests in a timely manner. We didn't care about paying extra for water or snacks but felt the $250 delivery fee to our suite was excessive.
10,First off our room was dirty and outdated complete with tiles popping off in the shower. My boyfriend got sick after eating a breakfast sandwich at Hazel in Mandalay Bay they agreed saying it would be a $50 late checkout. Instead they contacted us saying we owe $300+ for late checkout the price of another night. Lying scumbags.
30,The rooms was good but check-in process was terrible. I received one room at check-in but received another room at 11:30PM due to some cleaning procedure. They promised me a discount but still charged full. Not sure how they will fix it now.
50,The facility was clean and the service was great. It is a bit on the pricey side. High resort fees. The beach and the shark reef is a must if you stay here. Nice location if you don't want to be in the midst of everything.
30,Rooms are getting dated seems like they haven’t been updated in 10 years. Staff in the VIP Highroller blackjack room are were not friendly at all. Casino host could not be bothered enough to speak to me at checkout.
10,My wife and I reserved a king room for our anniversary and my Birthday. When we arrived we were greeted with a double queen for the king price and a 50.00 food credit.We were also promised an upgrade the next day and got nothing but another food credit. The so called air-conditioned room woke us up every night we stayed in sweat. We were supposed to receive comp stays per MLife and never received these from MLife either.
50,We are coming back in February to see a concert. We enjoy Mandalay Bay very much and look forward to being there soon. We got a cabana by the pool and played all day in the lazy river soooo much fun. thank you The Norton's
20,They charged me $30 for the mini bar when it was never used. I messaged the property waiting to hear back still. Kinda annoying dealing with this after the stay. I know it's only $30 but it's the principle of being charged when it was not used.
50,Our stay at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino was excellent. The whole resort presents an attractive appearance. The VIP reception excels in effective and positive communications we always received clear and concise answers to all our questions and the staff was very friendly. Our room service (cleaning of our room) was by fare the best the best of the best. This was our annual trip to Las Vegas to celebrate our wedding anniversary (58). Again thanks to all the staff of Mandalat Bay for an excellant stay see you for our 59th.
40,Our room was nice and spacious over looked the highway and the Michelob ULTRA Arena - not the best view. The beds were comfortable.    There was only one map we found just before you walk outside to the pool area. There is signage in the casino area as to which direction things were. We never did see signage or anything for the tram. I would have enjoyed taking that over to Excalibur.    No information posted in the pool area about closed facilities or amenities. Many restaurants and pool areas were closed. I understand we went later in the year but there seems to be easy enough to post that information so you're not surprised when you walk down there. We could have saved ourselves a lot of walking. We went to check out the Moorea Beach Club and the attendant was rude. There was nowhere posted that we needed a reservation. He said the cover charge was $10 per person. This information was not noted anywhere in the area or on the property.    I am not sure if they just don't provide books in the room with resort information anymore but that would've been nice. There is a mini-bar instead of any empty fridge. We would've preferred an empty fridge to trying to use one of the double-sinks.    I don't know if I would stay again for the price we paid for the hotel and Uber/Lyft service to get to a more populated part of the strip to meet friends. I don't know if the Mandalay Bay Beach was really that worth it.
50,Show was great/ Convention Floor was bountiful with exhibitors and facility was first rate. Accommodations and restaurants were superb. Overall an excellent experience. Look forward to the next event and being in Mandalay.
50,need work on host communication never could contact never returned voice messages I am a M-LIFE PLATINUM card holder Golden Nugget has offered me a lot and the host there took time to visit with my wife and I
20,Rooms are inexpensive every other part of the resort is over priced. The same wine I buy at many dinners was 30% more than other locations on the strip. Breakfast cafe only buffet is shut down. Extremely short staffed at all the bars and most closed very early. Late checkouts was not available (at any price). Massive conference facility but that is it.
50,The rooms are very nice. The casino and restaurants are great. But the thing that sets Mandalay Bay apart is the service. The front desk went out of their was to get me into a room early so I could prepare for a presentation. The concierge took care of my last minute dining needs when everything was full. The bell desk helped me out with display materials above what I requested. All around great service. This will be my first choice in Vegas from now on.
40,Mandalay once a mainstay is a matter of convenience. The restaurants and comps need to step it up to compare with other properties. I would now choose Aria and other properties any day. Probably won’t go back to this old school establishment.
50,my family and I had good services. I would come back again because the services was good the rooms were all so well clean  the towels were white rooms refreshed each day. We had a very time in the Casino's.
50,Six of us had a wonderful stay at Mandalay Bay so beautiful. Room was clean and spacious food options was plenty service was friendly and great. Pool area was relaxing with guest service that was attentive and friendly. Very memorable visit
50,The place was as expected it was my first visit in several year to the hotel and casino. Room / suite were just as clean and refreshed as ever the service was impeccable and the restaurants were good as expected. Enjoyed the casino although with Covid-19 the foreign tourists were not around so it seemed a bit empty nonetheless less enjoyed playing craps with other guests.
50,My husband and I went with our adult children and it was truly the best timers bad. We all went to the night club and had a blast!!! We were all treated amazing. We will be going back soon. The rooms were beautiful also
50,Stayed at Mandalay Bay after all three day bike ride in a Death Valley. Excellent room great hotel with good amenities. I liked the shopped at Mandaly Bay being so convenient. Wish the weather had been warmer so pools could have been used. Would stay there again
50,Awesome rooms. Only thing was we did not receive clean towels after they were removed. Had to request for towels. Hotel is awesome and clean. Casino host is amazing and staff is friendly. Mandalay and Delano are our choice of hotels.
50,Stayed in the king suite with a panoramic strip view and it was absolutely amazing. Loved the site amenities especially the restaurants. Pleasantly surprised by all the options the market had when I needed a few items. Loved the bathtubs. Super comfy beds!
50,My husband and I loved everything about this resort. Great restaurants shopping pool/beach area! We realized our last day there that we literally could of just stayed in the resort the entire weekend. Just wish the rooms had microwaves and that we had more time to enjoy everything the resort had to offer. We’ll definitely be back with our kids.
50,My stay was very enjoyable the facility had everything you need all around in the same building. It is a beautiful resort. The convention center was practically located at a 10 min walk from the rooms. Food court was very rich and you have excellent variety of food choices.
50,Wonderful hotel excellent service. Staff were outstanding. Our room was beautiful. Hotel was easy to get around for the convention that I attended. Would stay here again any time my wife and I travel to Vegas.
50,Thank you for the exceptional service and service experience. I was booked at the Luxor and had to change due to my anemia and the hotel not having heat. The manager on duty at the Luxor called the manager on duty at Mandalay Bay to accommodate me. Such a blessing. I’m forever thankful.
30,I did my check in on the app received a digital key to get into my room. Mind you I’m getting in at midnight. I got all to way to my room (digital key worked in the elevator) and it didn’t work to let me in! Had to go all the way to the lobby after a long flight and get physical keys. Don’t use the digital key. It’s a gimmick even the front desk receptionist said so.
30,Unable to keep me in the same room. Did down grade me so my nephew had a bed. Second room chair and wall dirtybroken things in room. Room not ready early told me I was going to be text when was ready never got text. I had to call.
10,Beware it was supposed to be a nice getaway for Halloween weekend turn out to be a true nightmare! When I arrive none of the keys worked for the elevator or the room or the parking. I had to keep renewing the keys in order to leave and come back to the room. Staff was very unprofessional and was not helpful don’t bother going to the bell desk because they was terribly rude and unprofessional.
40,From the start the bell hops are awesome we had to have our TV repaired and he came fast was super nice and gave us a voucher for our troubles. Great place! Love the selection of places to eat! Handy to the train!
10,I stayed for 3 nights and switched rooms both rooms made horrible noises that made it impossible to work or sleep. Extremely disappointing. Not looking to ever stay here again. The noises came from plumbing or maybe construction
50,We came to Las Vegas for a conference held in the hotel and had an amazing experience. We luckily moved to the hotel from MGM which was complete trash. The staff at Mandalay and the entire hotel are amazing. We highly recommend.
30,Was here for conference.  Pros:  -Room was clean and good view of pool/mountains (make sure you ask for this as you dont want view of parking lot)  -was not too crowded when I was there  -They have a food court where at lunch you can usually get something in reasonable time period and price  -Housekeeping very efficent and quick always when i came back to room they had already come and fixed every thing  -The conference area we were at was fairly well arranged and not too far walk from rooms  Cons:  -So ANNOYING that you have to pay for water pay $12 for horrible coffee in kurig machine no refrigerator and if you use the mini bar fridge they charge you $50. Seriously Mandalay Bay did not win my interest in staying with you when I come back to Vegas for fun  -room service not very good menu  -the card system in elevators doesnt work that well so may get stuck going up and down elevator trying to get it to accept your card  -the power went out in a quarter of my room and they did not fix it for the 4 day stay just moved coffee machine to another plug  -They make it very hard to get into pools exercise places etc. I should have been given some information on how to get in where etc.and encouraged to use the facilities. And not charged. Again Mandalay why woudl I come back for leisure if when I was here for work I got no impression this is fun place to be  -far from rest of strip  -restaurants just ok  Basically they charge a lot and dont give you much but a room. I know this is how Vegas is but in post pandemic world make it worth my while. I have stayed at other places that at least make it fun/easy to get to pool etc.
40,My husband booked this girls trip for me and chose Mandalay because they have a lazy river. All three days we used the pool area there were no tubes or services. Most guest were just walking thru it. We we’re disappointed that the mini fridge wasn’t for our use. We couldn’t store any drinks or leftovers. I would definitely recommend to stay here it is a very beautiful resort.
10,If you want to use the refrigerator in the room you pay a $50 service fee. Mandalay will suck you in for an all ready higher than normal room charge. Then charge extra for EVERYTHING. You can't even sit on a lounge chair at the beach without a rent charge.
20,old room unhelpful front desk. We had an upgrade available that the front desk did not honor until we had to mention our friends with the same booking had just gotten it. Inconsistent front desk help. the room had leftover cleaning gloves and was not thoroughly cleaned.
30,It's been years since I've been to Vegas and I was surprised by how much it changed. You know you plan on spending more money when you go to Vegas but the hotel expenses were crazy. No coffee in your room can't put anything in the refrigerator no tubes to rent for the lazy river. If you wanted to get a tube for the lazy river they cost $40! The positives - the staff was very pleasant the pools are beautiful and there's a tram that takes you (Free) from Mandalay Bay to the Excalibur.
50,Booked at a reasonable price for a Friday night. Wasn't able to get early check in but the hotel was good about texting me when my room was ready unlike the Aria.    Room was nice and bathroom had a tub which was appreciated after not having one at the Bellagio.    I tried to get a booking for a spa treatment by calling first thing on Saturday morning but was unsuccessful as they were fully booked for the day so definitely make an appointment in advance.    Room service burger was great and well priced. I thought $10 for a can of diet soda from the minibar was insane though.    Getting ride share to the property is difficult as there are various pick up points around the property and no one is really clear on where they are at any given time. I really hope that gets sorted out as it was a major pain and it would be nice to return here and use more of the facilities.
50,The hotel was very nice and extremely kid friendly. We were traveling with three boys age 12 7 and 9 years old. They absolutely love the pool area. We also saw the Michael Jackson One show (definitely the highlight of our trip it was amazing) and did the shark reef.
30,Overpriced. Any problem encountered is easy to push away because nothing is under anyone’s control. Don’t even touch the mini fridge. Everything is on sensors and if you want to put anything in the fridge it’s 50$. You are better off staying at a cheaper hotel seeing as you won’t spend much time there anyway
10,This used to be one of our favorite places to stay. The hotel has started to fall into disrepair - basic things that need attention (like elevator keys not working buttons missing simple maintenance in rooms and hallways). Additionally it is clear that they are short on staff. the staff is overworked and rude. The casino staffing is especially short. The smoke in the casino seemed exceptionally thick and my clothes/lungs will not forgive me for a while for visiting.
50,Very clean and staff was very nice! No issues. Little pricey but excellent amenities and careful consideration for our needs makes it worth it. Elevators are fast and staff was accommodating and patient.
40,Well appointed rooms good views relaxing space. Spa is very good- had facial and massages and spent time prior to and after services. Staff wore masks - felt safe.  Smoking is permitted in the casino - cigars vaping and cigarettes.  Food choices are good. Food court at the convention center too.
50,Very spacious and comfortable rooms friendly staff with quick customer service. Although the hotel was very busy with conferences and vacationers every staff member went above and beyond!  Thank you!
50,Mandalay is a great stay on the strip. It is a great place where you wont have a ton of college kids running around but also not going to be priced way out of budget. The pools are great the casino is clean and the staff is helpful.    Ill ding it a point for location; If you are looking to walk and site see its a bit off the beaten path. you can however quickly take the tram Mandalay to Excalibur then walk across to MGM and catch the main tram there. You really dont have to leave the property if you dont want its a one stop.    We were actually married at Mandalay in 2018 and they did a fantastic job with that as well. If you havent stayed at Mandalay yet you really need to give it a shot.
20,Check in staff seem to be bothered by you. Away from the strip.  Bath tub wasnt very clean.  If you try to address issues through their phone in the room good luck if you get an answer.  I have stayed in several hotels on the strip. For a few dollars more it is worth for you to move to your next best selection.
30,They charged $12 for a cup of coffee that is free in most other hotels. It was more expensive that the Starbucks downstairs. Everything else was fine in room dining was good maid service good checkin and checkout good.
10,Paid $1000 for a 2 bedroom king suit on the 16th floor. ZERO hot water in our room. Took a hour for anyone to come look at it. Missed our dinner reservations because we could shower. Engineer said it had been happening for weeks didnt fix it told us we had to run both tubs for 25 minutes to get the water to our part of the building 🤦🏻‍♂️ Hotel staff basically said too bad.
10,Poor customer service. One of the desk staff was not personable long lines at check-in the mobile check-in didn't work pre-check-in didn't work the key card at the elevator didn't work. The tv didn't work. when I called no one showed for half an hour and I had to call again. Not many sanitizing stations. No sanitizers in the room. I'd never recommend this hotel to anyone.
20,We advised the front desk of our special occasion. We don’t usually expect special treatment for things so we’re not disappointed when they didn’t offer any upgrades. But they then put us in a horrible room with no view made it difficult to change. Much of the staff in the casino was rude or passive despite the amount of money we spent. And for being as strict as they were on the masks the cleanliness was less than par.
50,My bf proposed in a private setting in a gorgeous room amazing weekend never forget it the ciew was beautiful the staff was polite and attentive everyone was friendly the room was spacious and beautiful the bathroom perfect with the tub
50,The hotel is nice  The aquarium is amazing I hope to go back next month  The jelly fishes  This is a jewel in Las Vegas  Underwater tunnel  Price is 20 and 40 depending of the services  You get yo see sharks. Pirañas among others  All must go there  Very Clean  Then in the hotel you have a good court  Restaurants  Nice Pool
50,Great First Trip to Vegas!!! Everything about our stay was great!!! Although the room we booked wasn’t available the staff made it better by giving us a 100 food/drink credit!!! Will definitely come back!!!
40,Great little staycation with the kids. Digital key was a pain to use in the elevator but other than that great. The kids loved the side of the wave pool for smaller kids. Room was super nice. Staff was very helpful when needed
40,The rooms are nice the view is great and the pool areas are awesome. The lazy river is definitely a favorite for relaxing. I just wasn’t happy with the fact that it took my friend’s room 3 hours longer than the original check in time to be ready and that was with a rush on housekeeping. Also wasn’t thrilled that the Mlife desk wouldn’t let me use my rewards to buy Freeplay for the casino because I didn’t pay for two nights at the hotel.
50,The pool was so relaxing. The casino had a darker theme than some of the other casinos which was more relaxing and laid back that others on the strip. Rythym and Riffs and Eye Candy was great for dancing or hanging out with friends. There was always something to do at Mandalay Bay.
40,Service was very good. Everyone was helpful. I was there for a convention for 5 days. I think it's good for couples. But if I had kids I think it would get expensive. There is no fridge/microwave/bottled water offered. The fridge in the room is for alcohol and snacks which you can purchase. You are warned not to look at it or lift it or you will be charged. There is a small safe in the room. I didn't have time to do much outside the hotel so did everything within the hotel/mall/other hotels connected to it. Tap water is not very good so you'll have to buy water every day. There is a store and places to buy water in the hotel but it's about $5/big bottle which is for one person. Food in the restaurants were pretty good not great-there is great variety of options. Lunch $25-50/pp. Dinner $50-100/per person excluding alcohol.
20,Never before checked into a room without bath soap or shampoo and when I called nothing happened. It took personal trip to two front desks to get 1 bar of soap and that was pulling teeth. All the food is absurdly overpriced. In the room a bottle of water costs $10.00. Coffee pod use for the Keurig maching costs $8.00 to use. If you store your own soda in minibar fridge that is $50.00. Casual food restaurants are similar. Slice of pizza is $8.00. BUT you can leave and go across the street for good food at normal prices. The use of electronic card for elevator and room is very glitchy. I saw people having trouble getting to their floor.
30,Expected a little more considering the per night price. Would be nice to have an in-room refrigerator to cool down my own bottled water...rather than paying $10/bottle for the water in the min-bar refrig
40,Resort is very nice and had many things to do without living the property. Has a lot of options on site. Most food I ate onsite was mediocre and pricey. Hospitality could be improved- mostly minor housekeeping issues.
50,I was very happy with my stay this past week - all the staff was friendly and helpful and the facilities and rooms were all very clean. Although a little farther down the strip I preferred it as it was slightly quieter and felt more up-scale.
30,You want to pay $50 to store your leftovers in the tiny fridge? You're all set. Or clean the bathroom yourself? Great. They won't send anyone when it floods from the toilet overflowing with bubbles while You're out of the room.Oh and forget a hot tub..you won't get one after 6pm. Great time had by all.
50,Mandalay Bay is a great property! Everyone was great from the front desk bell hop room service and housekeeping. Lots of variety with food choices. The Luxor Excalibur and New York New York are all right together which made it nice to venture out and still be within the M Life umbrella. Our trip was enjoyable-lots to do and see!
10,Horrible customer service and room conditions. Water got turned off for 45 minutes without any notice while my wife was in the shower. Then found out that the room’s phone didn’t work so had to walk all the way to the lobby to find out what happened. Only response I got was “water will be back on in 25 minutes “.
50,It’s a nice hotel whit a good service good people friendly clean service nice restaurant and amazing viewing from my room tha people at the front desk very professional helping everybody me and my brothers have a amazing mini vacation thank you
20,We decided to do an upgrade when at check-in. The room unfortunately reeked strongly of smoke and we were staying the night with our 16 month old. The nice man delivering our crib tried to cover it up with an air deodorant but the outlet was not working. The outlet neck to the bed was not working either. This could have been such a nice stay too!
30,Room and facilities were great but you get fees charged up the but for stupid stuff. To use the Fridge in your room for food or drinks is 50 bucks a day!!! What a rip.. It’s not like these mega resorts are not making money hand over fist.
50,Had an amazing time... everything you need is right there in the hotel complex!    All the staff I interacted with were so helpful and kind. The housekeeping staff did an amazing job daily.    The hotel itself is in the middle of all the action with easy access to everything you'll want to see and do.
50,Mandalay bay is a beautiful bright clean hotel. We enjoyed our vacation with no issues and digital check in check out was very convenient efficient and appreciated. The bed and pillows were the most comfortable.
40,My girls birthday even though they didnt let her get in to the wave pool because she is short that was a bummer but love the pool bwcause the water was warm and that was the main purpose of getting that hotel thw pools.
50,We went here for a wedding and everything was great. The food court had many choices. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. Very simple check in process and the location was great. Will will definitely stay here again.
10,AC in room did not work. Room 87 degrees. Told us we would receive first 2 nights free if we moved rooms. We moved rooms but no credit received at check out. The did not fix this when informed what we were told.
50,Worth the money. Worth the hassle of finding your way around. The rooms are clean and very modern. The ambiance is exceptional. Very comfortable place . I’m super happy and would tell my friends amd loved ones to stay with Mandalay Bay !
50,"I got dragged along on a family trip - we were meeting family staying at the Bellaggio - and we booked at Mandalay Bay. I didn't want to go Vegas isn't my thing but I ended up loving MB. Great service at multiple points (since Covid this is one area that reviews indicate many hotels fail at) it's clean fantastic wave pool and proximity to Ri Ra which is one of the best bargain food experiences in LV). Again Vegas isn't my thing I'm not a drinker I don't smoke don't gamble but I've worked in food & hospitality management so I can discern good from bad and I'm picky about where I stay and dine. Here's what I discovered - some of the hotels on the strip are absolutely unbearable in terms of smell. The Luxor was awful couldn't stay in the building more than 10 minutes it reeked of cigarette smoke and Fabreeze. No idea how anyone stays there. Excalibur almost as bad and awfully cheesy. Bellaggio is beautiful very clean and pleasant but the problem is that everyone wants to see it including all the people on the strip that aren't even staying there. So the Bellaggio becomes a sort of waypoint a central congregation center which means it becomes the Grand Central Station of the strip. Packed chaotic and not at all peaceful and serene. You're paying higher rates to stay there and you're joined by huge numbers of people that aren't actually paying to be there. The family members who were staying there wished they were at Mandalay Bay by the end of their trip. MB is more peaceful feels more like you're on vacation as opposed to navigating a busy train station at rush hour and it's beautifully decorated. Not as picturesque as Bellaggio of course but just as clean and far more relaxing. And Bellaggio doesn't have MB's huge wave pool or lazy river which we had to ourselves on our last morning. What a concept - we got to enjoy some romantic time in peace and seclusion at a large Vegas hotel. Didn't see that coming. The room at MB was beautiful and we just had the regular-rate room bed was fantastic bathroom far nicer than we expected with a big tub and huge double vanity. And again every service point was superb - we were treated as if we were far richer than we are. My wife summed it up best - ""it didn't feel like the typical Vegas tourist trap it actually felt like a vacation"". Quick kudos to Jasmine at check-in PD Adam and Eric on Bell desk and Maria DeCarlo on lobby agent duty - thanks for a great stay!"
50,We always stay at Mandalay Bay and are Never disappointed. The room was very clean and the staff were very attentive. The keyless check in using your mobile phone is genius and the comps for returning guests are outstanding.
50,"From the ""VIP SERVICE"" OFFER that allows one to be transferred to and from the airport by Limo to the use of the VIP LOUNGE and early check-in and late check-out our total experience was exceptional! You will not be disappointed staying at Mandalay Bay. We have been to Las Vegas every year since 2004 and this was our best experience by far."
30,The staff was great but our room had old toilet paper stuck on the wall and the sheets and pillow had stains. We also loved that there were lots of restaurants in the hotel but the only problem was it was too far from the action of the strip.
50,Fantastic time as always at The Bay!! Super friendly & helpful staff great location awesome property amenities. As with all MGM properties you feel a much higher level of care and comfort from their staff than others whether it's in the casino pool guest services restaurants etc.
40,This hotel was nice. Previously stayed at other end of strip where prices were cheaper and I could actually use the refrigerator. Hotels in general should be asking if you want housekeeping or not. We assumed we were getting it. Had none for 2 days then randomly had it the next 2 days.
20,I reserved for two nights in a Resort King but upon arrival I was given a two queen bed room instead due to no more availability of what I reserved which was never mentioned to me until I got to Mandalay Bay day of my check-in.
20,It took over 3 days to get approval for a suite. The room was not worth the price. All the amenities were not available. Fairly clean however the room was dated with older fixtures. I would not stay here again.
10,Apparently making a reservation there doesn't mean anything to them. I reserved a king bed resort view and when I arrived they gave me a queen and stated that making a reservation is not guarantee. Also it is way over priced for the value.
20,It would've been nice if the staff would've offered help. We got lost a few times and didn't get the help what we needed. I shouldn't have had to contact the hotel manager when there was plenty of staff.
30,AVOID the restaurants. Service is awful. Prices are stratospheric. They don't keep to your reservation times. Portions can be minuscule. The noise levels in their restaurants are like being at a rock concert. Wear heavy clothes in the restaurants as they keep the temperatures in the restaurants and casino's in the low 60s.
50,My stay was great. I was there to speak at a conference. I booked using the group rate which the hotel noted when I had to extend my stay due to flight delays and gave me a great deal on extending. The service was prompt and courteous. I had a bunch of shirts etc needed pressing and when only one set came back they fixed the problem within 20min of me noticing.
10,Everything in the hotel is pay to use. The waters ($10/ea) are on a scale that automatically charges you if they are moved. Mind you coffee and water are complimentary at most hotels except this $300-$500/night room. Charging for basic amenities like this is just a trap and isn't high end- it cheapens the whole experience. Also don't put anything in the fridge this is all rigged to charge you too. $50 to use the fridge in your room if you want to keep anything cold... On top of this many details of cleaning were overlooked so it definitely feels like a used room. I get that Las Vegas was hurt during Covid but a lot of industries were and making a guest feel like they're not welcome is far from how I'd like to help the industry revive and thrive.
20,The food was sub-par no instructions were followed and upon complaining nothing was rectified. They will serve you what they want . The bathroom had a constant leakage. The AC was very loud overall bad experience. I though only my rooms was bad but all my colleagues complaint the rooms were smelly and bad.
10,I had a business trip to a conference that was held at Mandalay Bay and I checked in to my room to find it not cleaned properly. There was a half drank chocolate milk bottle and a plastic container with half eaten pineapple in the mini fridge. There was also a half eaten french fry under the seat and I stepped on a beer bottle cap with my bare feet that left by the bed. I emailed guest services with photos and never heard back. Also no one at the hotel enforces masks even though there are signs everywhere that masks are required. If you are going to Vegas find a different hotel. This was a terrible experience. Disgusting actually.
40,overall great hotel - spacious very nice rooms...bed was very soft which killed my back and concierge was 15 min hold and still no answer...convenient location for trade shows and great restaurant selection
50,Everyone was so friendly; the room was roomy and comfirtable (in a classic way) 10/10 will be back. One thing to note is that if you need more coffee they will give it but you have to go to the front and request.
10,"This was the worst hotel stay I have ever experienced. It was late at night and my party was exhausted.    - We waited over an hour in line to check in then when we got to the room it was a king instead of the two queen beds we reserved.  - - Being absolutely exhausted from a day of work and travel we tried to call the front desk for help. No answer. So we had to wait in line. AGAIN. It was past 1AM at this point...  - The front desk tried telling us there were no double queen rooms available. Does that mean previously they purposefully gave us the wrong room type rather than telling us? Why were they wasting our time? We showed them on the website it said there was availability right then for two queen beds. After a dramatic eye roll from the front desk they said ""nevermind we do have a room."" SHOCKING.  - - We drudge our tired selves up to the room again close to 2AM now. And what do you know! The room was clearly used and had not been cleaned. The beds were slept in and it was dirty. Disgusting. This is absolutely unacceptable during Covid.  We decided at this point that we would rather leave than continue trying to resolve the issue with the front desk. Mistakes happen and being understaffed is not the front desk person's fault but literally no apologies from the front desk or the supervisor were made. I have decently thick skin but we felt like a burden for simply trying to check in to our room. It was so frustrating and disappointing to be treated like trash by service staff. It was frankly insulting to have that level of service from a supposedly high class hotel.    I decided to stay at an MGM resort because of an Amex offer thinking it would be good to feel it out since I have several upcoming work trips to Vegas. I will absolutely not being staying with MGM again. I have had better service experiences from small town Super 8s. I hope MGM takes this feedback into consideration and improves their training of front desk staff at Mandalay Bay."
50,Great room Friendly staff Great band ( Patrick and the LVB ) We had a blast playing in the casino and walking around the hotel and checking out all the shops. Michael Jackson One was a great show. Overall we had the greastest time and can't wait to go back.
50,My trip was great the Mandalay Bay had friendly staff the bed was awesome and the rooms looked great! i will continue staying at this hotel. and the noodle restaurant was great even the gift shop had all the essentials and quick easy grab sandwiches
20,No hand towels no washcloths no replacements the next day. Dirty sheets. 1 Bar of soap for the sink and shower. Hallways smelled of cigarette smoke.    80% of blackjack tables Not open. Limited number and availability of table games.
30,priced like a 4/5 star hotel with the equivelency of luxor or new york new york rooms are bland over priced mini bar no room fridge. Hotel does have some advanatages great location walking distance to staduim tram to excaliber
30,The room rate even for a large medical conference seemed expensive--$300 for the first night and about $250/nite for the others. And even so there were extra charges for everything including coffee that I could make in my own room. Then too in order to get to the adjacent Convention center one was urged to walk through the Casino--and beyond--quite a long walk for persons like me of advanced age and arthritis.
50,Came for the Marijuana convention. While at the Mandalay bay we visited the Shark encounter exhibit. Beautiful! Loved the octopus and the jellyfish. Everywhere we ate was delicious. Bought a beautiful cardigan at Paradiso and delighted in the selection in the bathing suit shop next to the spa. Beach and pool area was gorgeous. Wonderful place to stay.
10,Upon arriving at 8 pm the door lock did not work and required a 2 hour service by maintenance which was frustrating. The room was dirty and housekeeping would not clean regularly as requested. Also no soaps in room so bring your own. Hotel dirty and a lot of broken elevators and other stuff. Additionally sections of the casino had a foul sewer smell. The hotel is far from most of the other LV strip making it difficult to access.
10,Mandalay Bay is not near the monorail; you require a trip on the tram to Excalibur then another 10-15 minute walk to the monorail station at MGM Grand. Inside the room one cannot use the fridge to store anything (water insulin breast milk whatever) lest you incur $50 charges for moving items around plus the black sensors in the fridge trigger extra charges for minibar items. The mobile app failed to facilitate checkout or to operate elevators or room lock.
40,Mandalay like all of the hotels on the strip are trying to regain their standing since reopening after/during the pandemic. Staffing shortage is apparent but the staff they have are obviously making an all out effort to satisfy the needs of their guests. Towels and wash clothes looked dingy and worn and I had to request fresh ones from my housekeeper. Besides that the rooms and common areas were clean but looked dated.
30,Clean hotel nice rooms comfortable beds. Staff is okay but nothing special. Casino has high limits (25$ on most tables) which makes tou commit a big budget if you want to gamble. Ideal location if you want to go to the nfl stadium but it is far from the main attractions of the strip.
40,The hotel is beautiful the pools are great the room was large with plenty of closets and a big bathroom. What I did not like was in room coffee costs $12+. This is the only hotel I've ever stayed in that doesn't give you free in room coffee. If they had charged me $12 extra for the room I would have stayed there anyway. But $12 for coffee I will never go back.
20,Hotel has such potential but….Check in was a nightmare. Keys don’t work multiple times and long lines at check in counter to get help. Old nasty towels provided in room. Chairs needed to be replaced. Our room was over pool so heard music all night every night. Only good thing is location to get to Raiders stadium.
10,Bathroom smells like urine even after we requested that they clean it again towels are rough and sometimes dirty bedsheets are rough TV stops working from time to time room card does not always work.
50,Had so much fun at the Mandalay Bay! Stayed four nights! What a great experience had fun gambling and what great food. Staff was all so friendly and accommodating. My first trip to Vegas glad we stayed here! Lovely suite and an awesome view!
10,During my one night stay the water on multiple floors was shut off for maintenance. I was not notified prior and when I checked into my room after a long road trip I was not able to shower or use the bathroom. I paid $280 for a room I couldn’t even brush my teeth in. Needless to say I will not be staying at Mandalay Bay again.
40,My wife and I enjoyed our time here. The rooms are very nice clean and spacious. However they are overpriced and if you touch anything in the room be prepared to pay out the nose for it. $20 bottled water...ridiculous.  Casino is clean but not smoke free which can really ruin a fun time.
30,Water being shut off yet still being charged for water at the room minibar s as well as electrical issues in the bathroom with lights failing due to an electrical short requiring me to reset the outlet plug in the bathroom. Hotel way to far on the edge of the strip requiring yeoman effort to see other attractions.
10,No water supply from midnight till 8 AM basically the only time we spent in room and Nobody picked up the phone to help !!  I tried calling waiting but no one responded.  Since we had an early morning flight we hardly got water to get ready in morning.
30,"Honestly don't expect much unless you're spending an insane amount of money (the ""average"" rooms run $200+ a night). There will be no microwave and the refrigerator will cost you $50 to store even a drink in it since it's already stocked and you'll have to pay $8 for a can coke or water--I don't even want to know what the teeny bottles of alcohol would cost. The room had a nice view the tub was nice but the constant and poignant stench of marijuana on our floor (57th) was so strong it woke us from sleep made our eyes water and literally choked us on the ""non-smoking"" floor. I've had better experiences at Fairfield Inn or other similar places--we were simply disappointed especially for how much it costs to stay there."
40,The MB is a great property overall with semi-upscale amenities and decor the pool/beach area looks wonderful though I've never had the chance to use it LOTS of great dining options and friendly staff. A few minor issues with room cleanliness but nothing too gross and is usually resolved pretty quickly with a call to front desk/housekeeping. I still recommend MB and would definitely stay again.
10,Refrigerators are a rip off - stay away. Stored my own milk for breakfast got billed for two items I did not use. The check in process is a hot mess room keys did not work no service. Signage was a disaster. It is constructed to keep you inside and get you lost and disoriented.
50,Nice trip. Hotel was great but the convention center is quit a walk from the hotel. Being handicapped I had a scooter which made the trip to the convention center much easier. The blackjack table even had a place for scooters.
50,Super clean room and comfy beds. Pool was nice. Staff friendly and helpful when deciding what to eat ro drink. Loved the live music in the bar lounge near the lobby elevators. Prices here are a lot better than bellagio.
40,You guys need a better comp program.    I'm a platinum member with Caesars and I get multiple night stays fully comp'd whenever I go to Vegas. I do enjoy MGM properties (Mandalay Aria etc.) but I can't stand paying for rooms when I'm an active gambler.
30,Rooms were clean except for a brown smudge we found on the bathroom. The technology in room is dated and there are not enough working bedside plugs/ no master light control from bed/ no way to access own streaming services. My main reason why I am rating the hotel average is because of the hospitality experience. I did not feel the staff cared I had a good stay. I requested a solution for saving my leftovers and the staff suggested I pay $40/ night to rent a mini fridge. I would like to point out the room had an existing mini-fridge which guests cannot use. The staff hung up on me mid-sentence. The hotel gives off a “nickel-and-diming”-vibe.
50,Great - Friendly and Helpful Staff! from Check-in to Shop to Restaurants!  Clean! Beautiful Property on par with the newest Hotels on the Strip  Self Parking was Convenient  Citizens Kitchen & Bar - Great Breakfast
10,Room was so expensive! Over $650 per night for a king room.  Pool was packed  I got charged$23 dollars because the nuts and M/m’s got moved a couple of inches. Had to call guest services to get it reversed.  No papers in the room at all….channel guide? No Menu? No  The room was poorly stocked. Only 2 towels and the quality of the towels was like my Jr. High School Gym  No instructions in the room at all.  Charged $12 for in room coffee in a paper cup. WTF?  Resort fee outrageous no value there just a way. To extract more money from us.  Hold times for “guest services” was anytime from 5-20 minutes.    Room wasnt very well cleaned. We had a small unwelcome surprise in the nightstand. 2 boxes of condoms one was open.    R
10,Phones old. Bed hard. Paid 1300 a night for a $200 a night room. No bells & whistles. No good view. Had to ask for face towels. Room service $30 for coffee. Paying that much coffee should have been complimentary
20,"Mandalay Bay may have been a top tier hotel at one time but seems to have fallen into the ""has been"" category. Several oversights poor welcome lackluster accommodations just disappointing overall."
30,There are more convenient hotels to stay at.  Rooms are very nice  Seems odd to put coffee makers in the rooms but then charge for use of same  The convenience store by the elevators was very handy.  Room service was speedy and food was goid
50,Mandalay Bay never disappoints and that includes the amazing staff and service. The fact you can shop gamble grab about 15 options for food hear music live makes it one of my favs. If it were summer I’d be writing about the pool BEST in Vegas!
30,Love Mandalay Bay—normally very clean. This time though it was not. We were notified that our room was ready at 3:15pm. We went up to find that our bathroom hadn’t been cleaned at all from the previous guests.
50,This place is amazing! The room was beautiful. The staff are exceptionally friendly. The pool was so much fun. There was only one small issue about this trip that was not up to par and they even made that right. Highly recommend!!
50,"Love the spacious rooms and pillow top mattresses at the Mandalay Bay. The role in shower has a handheld unit and is very large with lots of safety bars for balance. The casino is very spacious and although smoking is allowed the machines are a bit further apart than other casinos so it was not a problem. Love choice of restaurants too. It was warm enough to swim in October and zooming down the ""river"" on an inflatable donut was a blast for some of us! A great time had by all on our 4 night trip!"
50,This place has everything you can ask for from the shows to dining and shopping And of course gambling. We definitely enjoy strip steak the Michael Jackson experience the shark reef and the house of blues
30,Don’t think they had rented our room for a while as it had a smell like moth balls was clean but time to be updated especially for the price they charge you can book a newer hotel or renovated one ..
20,I didn't get the room that was described to me over the phone. Instead I got a room with now view. Also got charged 500$ for leaving a day early. I left because I wasn't satisfied with the service. Not good!
10,Hotel is dated but still in fairly good shape. Staffs are friendly and helpful. As for the room OMG you can not use fridge or you will be charged $50 for putting your own items in it! No free parking either $15/day
30,Phone check in at 9am with fellow travelers. They got rooms. We didn’t til after 3:00pm despite a long line at the registration desk at 3:00pm checking in guests. Apathetic staff and needed to vocally complain in order to get a room. Originally booked weeks in advance.
50,I have been to this hotel several times during conferences. Facilities are great and location is very convenient. I will probably come back next year as well and look forward to the same good facilities and service.
30,Mandalay Bay is a nice hotel however there are nicer ones on Vegas strip that have a better location. Unless you are going to the Raiders Stadium there is nothing else that you can walk to although there is a tram. Also one thing I did not like that there were no blackjack tables with less than $25 minimum. And this was during the week not the weekend.
40,We enjoyed the comfort and view from our room. The beds and accommodations met our expectations. Gluten-free free options were limited at the restaurants. Lupo's was an excellent place to eat. A lot of walking to one resort to another. (only one tram working at the time). A few hick cups but all in all a great place to stay.
50,Loved everything about this hotel! Only real problem I did have though was we ate at the seabreeze cafe and the two host were talking crap about my husband in Spanish not knowing he could also speak Spanish! He sure shut them up once he did!
30,Several issues..dirty room some of the staff were not the friendliest. I witnessed a bellmans rudeness to another bellman that was only trying to help me. The conference I attended is at this location every year. This was not my first stay.
20,"Short on staff. No clean pillow cases. No clean towels. Was comp'd with $75 in ""drinks"" when each drink is $30. Still not worth the money I paid for the room rsvp. I don't recommend. Pretty far off the strip if your looking to walk there. Not worth $ for this casino. Look elsewhere."
10,Horrible experience. Given a dirty room. Then moved to a room where keys didn’t work. An hour to check in after 4 hours on the road. Won’t be back! Staff did nothing to make the experience right. A dirty room in the middle of a pandemic! Unacceptable!!
40,Michael Jackson 'ONE' cirque de soleil was spectacular. Kids enjoyed Mandalay Beach especially the lazy river. Tram connecting to Excalibur and New York New York made it easier to enjoy entertainment and activities.
50,Mandalay Bay is beautiful resort with friendly staff. I wish it was closer to the middle of the strip but the tram between Mandalay Bay and Luxor was really helpful after a long day of walking. But my favorite thing was the bathroom with a wonderful tub to soak in after a long day!
40,Nice hotel but you pay to feel like you’re rich although you are not treated as you if you were. I waited 30 minutes after ordering a drink while playing at a machine I had doubled my money printed ticket in hand when my drink finally arrived. The concierge was helpful for purchasing tickets to the Shark Reef (no discount given for staying at the Mandalay Bay where it is located) but when asked for help for dinner reservations for 4 3 days in advance even the cash I gave him could t get us a reservation anywhere 🤔
50,this was a good business stay we were off trip for the business meeting but easy access to ! 15 and the Beltway make this very convenient . The restaurant group is always very good and conveniently together.
30,Was in Vegas for a conference. This was my 4th trip to LV. Previously stayed at Bellagio MGM and Mirage.    Taken aback by the fact that hotel wanted to charge extra for the use of refrigerator in the room - i purchased yogurt which i usually eat for breakfast due to my diet - i was not able to use in room refrigerator without paying 50$ resort fee. Same nickel and diming for the in-room coffee. Never in my life i have seen that… especially at 250$ per night room that charges resort fee anyway….    Was not able to use spa as for some odd reason it closed at 4pm daily.    The rooms were clean and up to date but small things like these will not have me return. Nearby airport and windows facing it - made it a bit noisy though at night
10,Water was shut off for 8 hours without notice ice machine was out of order key cards deactivated daily and half a TV stations did not work.    There are many other modern hotels on the strip that are better than this one they let this hotel become a budget
30,Horrendous food. Food was just awful! Staff was not very friendly. Rooms were clean. Great location if you’re attending Raiders game! I would suggest sleeping here and eating anywhere else! Food at Wynnn was great!
30,The hotel has good facilities including wonderful pools great restaurants nice casino. The only issue is that my room had a nasty smell throughout my stay likely old floor carpets or just old rooms. The staff wasn’t able to find me another room either. Overall it is was an average experience
30,The room wasn't vacuumed that well. Dirt and buildup around the head of the bed. Mediocre cleaning of the room at the best.  Want to charge you for using the fridge. The bathroom was done like somebody was in a hurry and didn't want to do it I have photos of the toilet very nasty.
50,The rooms were clean and fresh. The view was of the parking lot but the room amenities made up for it. Express checkout by remote is a service that should be implemented in all casinos! I love your beach although I didn't have time to get a tan (Business trip). The House of Blues and The Seabreeze Cafe was fantastic! The Bet MGM viewing screens were bigger than the Venetian Hotel and Casino.
40,4th time staying here and always excellent. the pizza and chinese food have fallen off. everything else was excellent as usual. def recommend the dry aged rib eye at strip steak. was better than most of the other steaks available. as usual pool time was great. just wish we would actually win one of these times in casino lol
10,We stayed at the Mandalay Bay from in late October for a conference. I had previously stayed at the Venetian so obviously I was comparing the two the whole trip.    Price/Location: The price is pretty comparable between the two hotels but the Venetian is on a much livelier part of the strip with lots to walk around and explore. The Mandalay bay is across from a gas station. Even the LV Monorail is three hotels away. Honestly I have no idea why people stay here.    Rooms: The Venetian boasts the biggest standard rooms on the Strip so this room was obviously smaller but it was fine. BUT-- to use the fridge in your own room is $50??!!!!!! What kind of a RACKET is that??? I have to store medication in the fridge and dying is not an option. And the coffee/Keurig in the room is also not complimentary.    Amenities: There are none. To use the gym you have to pay for daily spa access. Even then it is not 24hr access. This is NOT STANDARD for Vegas. At the Venetian the hotel guests were allowed to use the gym without paying for the spa. At the Delano the fancy sister hotel to the MB the gym access is complimentary for guests.    The Pool/Beach: If you came to Vegas for a beach you should've stayed on the plane for another hour to California for a real beach.    Needless to stay I will not be staying here again.
50,We have stayed here multiple times. It is great to see more of the restaurants open. The food available is great and the room was very comfortable. We had a sky view suite which was nice. One thing to note we could here the music that came from the foundation room. This did cause a little trouble sleeping.
10,The hotel room had no water from 12-8 am. I was told to just use the bottled water in the room to wash our faces and attempt to flush the toilet. This didn't work out so well as I have a pregnant wife and i was on my period. My wife ended up getting dressed so she could walk down to the hotel to use the restroom. They told me the water from the mini bar would be comped but i had to call back before I checked out because i was charged $100 for the water. We also found a cockroach in the room and had to also call and have them come up to fix the TV because it wouldn't come on. There was a lamp that wouldn't come on and I ended up having to go out into the hallway twice to call downstairs because the cordless phone in the room wouldn't charge and every time I called the front desk with it on speaker they couldn't hear me and would then hang up on me.
30,Conference rooms and catering are fantastic! Hotel rooms very plain and basic. Low floor views are awful. Long dark hallways and you can hear EVERYTHING from neighboring rooms. Not likely to stay here next time….disappointing
50,The outdoor pools were amazing! The water was heated and super clean! The view from the room was perfect - strip and mountain views - will definitely be back for a longer stay very soon. The food at the border grill is authentic Mexican really delicious.
20,The bar in the room was not fully restocked when I check in and I had to pay for it even though I did not use any items make sure you check and let the reception know before you check out even though they will give you a hassle
40,Had hot water issues while pregnant which was an inconvenience but it was a generally an all around nice stay with good diverse food options fun attractions for family and couples as well as fun casino games with nice limits.
10,"We visited the rooftop bar here in June 2019  Once we went into the place we bought a drink and found it strange that even though we had bought a drink we weren't even allowed to sit down tables and seats only reserved for ""special clients"" whatever that means. Nothing like this would ever happen on the whole island of Ireland. I know Las Vegas is a tourist place but this hotel needs to get rid of their notions. Disgusting attitude towards the customers coming in wouldn't work in different countries"
10,One of the worst hotel stays in a long time. Apart from the room the experience was terrible. Understaffed chaotic illogical layout incredibly stupid system for in-room refreshments porn advertisements in the lobby.
50,VIP Check-in was amazing. Polite professional and efficient staff. The room was spotless and everything worked perfectly. We know we tried everything. Great shower and hot tub with perfect water pressure. With out a doubt the best pool/beach facility in Las Vegas.Online check out was a breeze. We can’t wait for our next trip next one will be pleasure.
30,it was average one of two rooms smelled like smoke. I could not check into both rooms in order to avoid the counter. Ended up at the front desk because of it. Someone smoking set alarm of at two in the morning.
30,It seems staffing shortages have impacted Mandalay Bay like so many other places.    We were not provided wash cloths or hand towels in our 2 BR suite. I called Housekeeping twice. The first time I hung up eventually when nobody answered. The second time I held until someone picked up. A very kind person eventually delivered the requested towels.    Old trip advisor reviews indicate a usable refrigerator (not the stocked mini-bar) is in the suites. This is no longer the case. You can request one for a nightly fee. We wound up getting ice from down the hall. There is a locked cabinet where I imagined a frig was once located.    There are now coffee machines in the rooms but no pods.    My bathtub had clearly not been cleaned for sometime. I used Clorox wipes - going over it twice before using the tub. The wipes had visible dark dirt upon wiping. Yikes    The lamp shade was damaged and the faucet didn’t work properly on a sink.    On a positive note the shower was great with good pressure and temperature.    Hopefully staffing improves to make this place shine again.    My Restaurant experiences were all good - Strip Steak and Citizens (really good fish tacos).    It’s a great conference venue.
50,The Mandalay Bay has restored my faith in hotel stays and in customer service. My friends Birthday celebration was a tremendous success and we will only stay at the Mandalay Bay when traveling to Las Vegas. See you soon!
50,Always stay here or the Delano which is part of Mandalay. Had to write a review after having the best time and experience with my dealer today Enne Bond. She is truly a gem! So sweet and a joy to interact with. Played at the table 5+ hours and every time she left for a break I was anxiously awaiting her return. She’s a keeper and if you’re reading this as a traveler find her and sit at her table!
40,The Madalay Bay Hotel is a gleaming sight to behold. The hotel is away from the central part of the strip and this can be good or bad depending on your requirements. For me it was just fine.    Check in was a bit chaotic but I was soothed by the gorgeous view from the room. The room was spacious and well appointed. A bit dark at night but that's what mood lighting looks like in all hotels lately. The bathroom had a lovely tub (which made dreadful noises when you turned it on) and a shower with lots of hot water and good pressure. The toilet had a really squeaky door and There weren't enough toiletries.    Breakfast is not included as part of the room nothing is. Everything is at a fee even storing items in the fridge. Censors will be triggered when you move items around and even if you don't consume them you'll get charged. (We eventually had these waived but it was annoying.)    Service was generally fine staff were pleasant and helpful. I lost my purse in the casino and it was found (with everything intact) by security! I was very impressed by that. Our concierge Ann also helped us find the most amazing tickets to the Michael Jackson One show by Cirque du Soleil. (Fantastic show btw).    Wandering around the hotel the various pools shops and to the food court was touristy fun. There are loads and loads of restaurants to sample. Generally a good experience except for the irksome fees.
50,Mandalay Bay had exceptional service with warm and friendly staff during check-in and check-out. The restaurant Stripsteak was one of my all-time most memorable meals. The steak and lobster mashed potatoes were spectacular. The rooms were spacious and comfortable and I would return in a heartbeat.
20,I was on a business trip and stayed at the middle eBay. I was looking forward to my stay because I had a king room with a view of Las Vegas strip. I had to request towels to my room because there weren’t any. Upon further inspection house cleaners have done a horrible job is there were crumbs and dirt underneath the desk glass and it was quite obvious and disgusting. Right before check out I got up early for a 6:00 am flight. The water on my floor was turned off and it was a huge inconvenience as I couldn’t wash my face and brush my teeth. I tried calling the front desk twice was on hold for off over ten minutes and then hung up on.
30,Here are tips to make it better:    Skip using the app. Useless. I tried checking in on it ended up waiting 1.5 hours in the lobby as others walked up to the front desk and got a room right away. The mobile app person just kept saying…just wait.    Don’t freak if your room key does not work in the elevators. Just hop out and grab the next one and you will be fine.    Don’t expect superior cleanliness. I compare it to the standard best western cleanliness.    Overall the stay was okay but not the nicest place on the strip.
10,Intermittent WiFi and hotel room A/C. Provided only two towels one bar of soap and one shampoo for two night stay. No wash cloths or hand towels. No vibe in the casino. You fall asleep at any of the tables. By comparison the Cosmopolitan was hopping. Mandalay is for elderly widows that like to fart.
40,The hotel was very nice-Shark Reef aquarium was great. The food was very good the hotel was very clean and staff was very friendly and competent in their jobs. It was a very good business event and the overall experience a positive one.
20,Bathroom fixtures were loose and not in good repair. Experienced a foot cut on shower drain plate which was sticking up from the drain and was sharp. TV service went out and was not corrected until late in the second day. Room was not touched by housekeeping on the third day of a four day stay.
10,The location is poor all the way at the end of the strip and they've shut down their tram station. I was there for a business conference and there's no place to sit and talk to client's - even in the lobby there are only standing tables. Check in was a mess they tried to get us to check in on a phone app that wouldn't work in the elevators (a key card is required to select one's floor.) Outside there was trash everywhere and the plants were poorly maintained.
50,It was a great stay. Definitely coming back! I would not stay anywhere else. It has great food and bars. Family friendly attractions like the shark reef. The tables minimum were a bit high. But still enjoyed ourselves.
50,New MGM mobile app was VERY helpful since we arrived at separate times and my spouse was able to get into the room before me.  The mobile app needed to be refreshed at times to work. the desk provided a key card happily.
40,In days past there were places to eat late night many table games open and lots of options at a place like MB. Now it's like a Biloxi or off Strip hotel...nothing open but Subway one group of tables and just doesn't have the mojo any more....
50,The Mandalay was ideal for us. Easy to get around Vegas from there but away from the rowdier crowds that swarm the strip. The restaurants in Mandalay are excellent. I especially enjoyed Fleur the Citizen Libertine Social and Border Grill. The rooms were spacious bedding was high quality and very comfortable. customer service was excellent throughout the hotel.
50,I hope to return to the Mandalay Bay Resort again soon! The hotel was exceptionally clean and the staff was very quick to cater to any needs or requests. The pools were fantastic and the casino very well ventilated.
50,Really exceeded my expectations. Clean great restaurants and shops. Being in the newer section of the Strip it was quieter although a good walk from some of the other casinos. Still well worth it. I'd definitely come back.
10,Horrible Experience No TV working Rooms not getting cleaned for 2 days manager extremely rude and not courteous or apologetic. Terrible mistake to stay at this hotel and ruin my best friends birthday weekend
10,Not happy with this experience…I don’t quite understand how this hotel is still in business. The check-in process was terrible and confusing. I had to request wash towels every day. The staff was not helpful or nice. Very dissatisfied
10,Booked and prepaid for a king suite at Delano. Got there and no rooms available. They switched us to a regular queen room at Mandalay. The bathroom was dirty. The chairs in the room were dirty and worn.
30,In all honesty the resort is nice and the pool is amazing. Out of 4 nights our room only got cleaned once. I asked for towels and extra cups and it took almost 2 hours each time. Especially on a weekend it wasn’t busy.
30,Expect to pay for everything no free coffee if you use the frig it is a $50 charge no free tubes for lazy river. You have to pay $28.00 for a tube Just a lot of little things that kind of ruined this stay. Won't stay here again.
30,I had an incident with security personnel that was handled very poorly. I work in the casino industry so to experience what I did was totally not how the situations should have been handled. It occurred on my final day of my stay and simply ruined what was a pretty good Vegas getaway.
50,This is the absolute best place to stay in Vegas. The rooms are beautiful and the staff is always amazing. You never really have to leave the hotel because everything you need to right there. I highly recommend staying at Mandalay Bay. You won’t be disappointed!
50,The rooms were very nice but the smell from both bathrooms were terrible because they had sewer issues. They have a beach style pool and that was a nice touch to the trip. Finally the staff was very friendly.
40,The check-was super easy and fast. Apply for the Mlife rewards Mastercard and enjoy there perks like the free parking for MGM resorts. Plenty of food choices near by Staff was friendly & helpful during our stay and the strip view room we stayed in was beautiful! Thank you Mandalay Bay! See you soon! 😊
50,Stayed at Mandalay since this was the location for my convention. This hotel was also conveniently located within walking distance to the new Allegiant Stadium for a Raiders game that I decided to attend also
50,when I first arrived to Las Vegas I wasn't sure I wanted to stay in a resort I ended up actually getting an Airbnb. After staying a few nights in my fabulous airbnb which was located only 10 min from the strip I decided hey what the heck and my entire experience of Vegas flipped crazily . the hotel room was amazing I stayed in a deluxe king suite which in my opinion was top 10 best hotels I've stayed in. The snack bar was pricey as per usual but the view was priceless  the amazing interior design and the outstanding bathroom concept was what made an unforgettable night even more. The weather was extremely hot so I decided to go to the pool and the Mandalay Bays beach was Incredible.
50,Great experience we came in 1 day early and no issues whatsoever keeping the rooms we had the rest of the stay which turned out to be another three days. The Vegas experience overall was a very fun time
50,Thank you to the front staff in VIP very kind and fast. Also arranged transport perfectly very kind and made sure we were taken care of. Casino is short staffed like the rest of the world but handled things very good thank you see you again
50,Very nice casino. Great food at House of Blues and Seabreeze. Quick walk to other casinos. Very clean an d spacious rooms. The best part… the lazy river and wave pool! I would definitely vacation here again!
50,I was there for a trade show in the Mandalay Bay convention center. The amenities (restaurants bars sundry shop) were good enough that I never had to leave the resort for three days. Convenience is great!!!
30,Ive stayed at the Mandalay Bay at least 6 times in the last 15 years a few of those times was for a conference. The hotel is getting progressively more run down in relation to the room decor and overall feel as compared to many of the newer hotels and this current stay in Oct 2021 is the worst so far in regard to staffing and service. I’m guessing it is the effect of pandemic related staff shortages.    This month I arrived at the hotel 3pm on a Monday at the main hotel entrance where you’d expect to see bellmen and other employees greeting and directing arriving guests to checkin helping with luggage or even hold the door open. No employees visible.. none. One guy inside to direct me to the self checkin kiosk (I had checkin on my MGM app) where I created my own room key. My colleagues told me they arrived an hour before me didn’t have the app and waited on line to checkin close to 30mins. ProTip- USE THE APP TO CHECKIN    Arrived at my room on the 9th floor thankfully it was ready when I arrived the room initially seemed clean but it wasn’t until I went to shower before dinner that I noticed there was someone else’s dark long hair all over the bathroom floor and in the shower NO washcloths one of the two bath towels was used but hanging folded on the outside of the shower door no shower gel or at least a 2nd bar of soap to use in the shower. I had dinner plans so I hastily showered using the same bar of soap I used for my hands earlier - a small inconvenience. Called to guest services to get housekeeping to bring more soap or shower gel clean towels etc the next morning at 8am waited at least 5 mins on hold for someone to pickup then was told there’s a washcloth shortage in not only this hotel but everywhere?    I ordered room service one day and waited on hold about 7 mins this time. On the upside they delivered my food quickly and it was fresh and tasty (chicken Cobb salad $24)    Another note if you’re considering staying here the Uber pickup signage at the hotel is confusing at best meaning there are signs directing guests to go downstairs and then one hidden sign on a post - we had to really look for it. Stood there at the post and it turned out that was the OLD pickup spot now you have to go to the parking garage. Again no hotel staff present to even ask where to go. Do you have other options consider Palazzo or aria. I believe the room rates are very close to the Mandalay and better located on the strip
50,I had reserved a king room which was a good price on Priceline. When I arrived the clerk saw that the room for for my daughter and myself. She offered a double queen for no additional charge. A+ room
10,Charged me a smoking fee because I did not report the mild smell of cigarette when I entered the room.  I do not smoke and neither does my guest. $466 charge to my credit card.  I have been traveling to Las Vegas for 35 years and this has never happened to me. Only at Mandalay Bay. These are criminal charges that I do not appreciate.
50,We attend a wedding so we decided to stay here also. Best decision our room was ready early check in and checkout so convenient. Hotel pool is beautiful room was so nice roomy and so many things to do.
50,I throughly enjoyed my stay at Mandalay Bay. The staff was friendly the room was clean. It was in a great location with an awesome view and I slept very well. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone I know.
30,Had to call every day to request wash cloths which were never left by housekeeping during daily room cleaning. Mold was growing on the shower through out my stay. Extremely long hold times when calling guest services to request wash cloths.
30,The guest room was lacking towels and soap. We had to ask for them. Room service is now dropped at the door in bags with to-go containers. They forgot one meal and all silverware. No restaurants open in hotel in the afternoon.
40,$20.00 bottles of water in the rooms & no complimentary coffee in the room. Each morning I had to go to a restaurant in the lobby for coffee! The room was cleaned but no new soap was put on the room. Was convenient having the conference I attended on the premises & the pools were beautiful.
20,I used to go to caesars resorts but i wanted to try Mandalay bay resorts. i was shocked with the treatment there-going back to caesars resorts only. Even though i stayed at casino and played high limits i still was charged for every little thing- ice in my drinks valet every night etc. no benefits for high limit spending
30,Overall reasonable price for the accommodation.  FYI. Parking and resort fees not included. if you visit a resort in the hotel group then parking is free. Our room could be adjoining and guests next door was noisy.
50,Love the room and the staff is helpful have stayed here 3 times this year (and even with Covid) I highly recommend the property. I normally can't sleep in hotel beds but these are comfortable and I was able to sleep without any issues.
50,Clean hotel! I've stayed in other hotels in vegas and thus one was my favorite. I especially loved the views & the pool.. Guest services & housekeeping was very accommodating I will stay again in the future.
50,Mandalay Bay was absolutely phenomenal to us for our weekend. The location the food the room the parking the shark reef and the staff. Other places cannot compare. We will definitely be coming back!
50,We stayed in a Stay Well Resort King! The room was really nice. The view was great it was a huge 2 room suite with a wet bar and a half bath. My only issue is it is a bit further down the strip than I anticipated. But I 100% would stay here again.
30,The water bottles in the rooms and stocked Mini fridge are ridiculously expensive. An unstocked fridge is much more desirable.  Several areas of the casino were very smokey poor ventilation. Otherwise pleasant.
10,The front door lock struggled to work. Room keys stopped working after 1 day. Digital key worked but lock still struggled. Bathroom doors difficult to open and made a ton of noise. It would wake everyone up if anyone opens or closed them. I dropped my phone between the bed and night stand. It was so gross. Carpet was grey with dust and a layer of hair on top of that. Looked like it hasn’t been cleaned in years! I won’t be back!
50,The room was very nice - clean the bed was comfortable. Service was good and friendly The pool area is the reason to stay here. Wave pool lazy river multiple pools cabana rentals etc. This would be great for families. It is at the end of the strip and requires a long walk or short cab ride to get to other casinos and attractions
50,Always a pleasure to stay there. We got the stay well room. the shower had aromatherapy the room had humidifiers the sheets and bed were softer and more comfortable. I always stay at Mandalay because they have the best pools and the rooms are great
50,I would book this hotel again without hesitation. They don’t disappoint. Very happy we chose this his hotel for a random getaway. From the mobile check in to mobile check out we had absolutely no issues. Thank you Mandalay Bay!
40,Staff were AMAZING and super kind very friendly and engaging but not overbearing. Our room had some stains in the bathroom which made me a bit weary when it came to the cleanliness but on the casino floor we never really saw any 'messes' and it felt relatively clean. Everything was a bit pricier than usual the resort fee really does get you and if you bump anything in the mini fridge you'll be fined a pretty penny. We were lucky to have a quiet floor so we slept pretty well.    Our room the plumbing was a bit of an issue but the bathroom was still nice and had a tub.
30,Don’t touch the mini bar tray or fridge or you will be charged $50/day. Nope it doesn’t matter if none of the items were used- it’s weight based. So we can’t even use the in room fridge?? Nope But if you need a fridge we can send one up for you. Yes please. Then we get charged $35per day for using the fridge that Mandalay Bay advertises is already included in the room 🤦‍♀️  Pools were great Our 3 year old was heartbroken he couldn’t play in the wave pool. Only 48” or taller can use it. Room was fantastically dark.
30,I have stayed in Las Vegas before. he casino business must be bust....room charges for water and coffee??!! Anyway the room decor is dated with normal wear and tear. I really wish they would spend some time telling you that you have options. Loved the fact my friends used delivery services or went off site. just never expected I'd need to do that for a convention. Average stay...there are much better placed in Las Vegas.
10,This hotel is dated and apparently having plumbing issues. My room was cleaned twice during my six night stay. The first day there was no hot water in shower. There is no free coffee in the hotel room. Cost is $12 for two Kcups. No free coffee in lobby either. The only way to get coffee is to go through the casino- which is not convenient. If I am going to pay a small fortune I would at least expect a decent room that is clean with hot running water and a free coffee maker.
10,The rooms were far away from everything including the parking garage. Who wants to walk all the way across the hotel/casino to get to a room. Room service is over priced. Room was tiny. Heard the person next to us all night long coming and going from their room
20,With a cold room(thermostat maxed out) inconvenient app digital key and loud gurgling bathroom drains from the neighbors using their toilet shower and sink I would not recommend staying here. Next time we will be booking somewhere else.
50,Anyone looking for a hotel in Las Vegas should definitely consider the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Convention Center. The staff are all so attentive to assure their clients have an awesome experience. They are attentive polite courteous and respectful regardless of their role and work very hard to address any issues of concern. They are a model for the hospitality industry.
10,When I arrived I found used condom boxes lubricant in a drawer. During the stay the television service was off for a day. We had no water at all one night and no HOT water once the water came back one. I was incredible surprised this was happening in a fancy hotel on the Las Vegas strip.
20,We had a two bedroom suite room 14-135 and both our tubs were old and dirty looking. They both needed to be reglazed and the entire bathroom smelled like mild. The towels are old and need to be replaced. The water went out during our stay for over 8 hours. When it came back on it took a couple hours for it to get hot. The cable went out for several hours another day for several hours. They offered to move us to another room but we had our 94 year old grandmother with us and she was already settled with her oxygen plus we had already unpacked. They gave us several credits for our issues which I appreciate but it still doesn't make up for how disappointed I was with our stay.  The rooms are outdated.
10,Room was dirty food was left in fridge showerhead was broken and front desk was a bit unpleasant. Was switched rooms mid week because the showerhead wouldn’t work. WiFi not functional in my room and the TV worked about a third of the time.
40,The overall stay was nice. We had a lot of trouble with room keys but the location was awesome. The food was good and the convenience of everything available was nice. It’s close to the Luxor so you can go see exhibits without ever even going outside!
30,The hotel was very nice and clean. The low rating is for 2 reasons - mobile check-in did not work and the daily housekeeping did not provide clean sheets or towels they just remade my bed and refolded my towels. Not at all what I would have expected from a hotel of this caliber.
30,Venue has a lot going for it but $5 for a bottle of water $4 for a can of soda $50 if you move anything -- not even consume it-- in mini bar is absurd. Great food nice rooms. Get a shipment from Vons and you can make it a great stay.
40,I stayed here in a double queen ADA accessible room with my father who uses a wheelchair. My sister and brother-in-law stayed in a King suite which was very spacious and nice. In our room there wasn't any seating in the room that my dad or I could easily rise from; he also could not rise from the toilet. We had to buy a toilet riser and leave it. No restroom in the lobby so my father either had to make it to our room or go to the other end of the casino. I found the beds to be too tall for me and hard but the pillows were way too soft. I did not sleep well at all.  Location is on the end of the strip but with rental scooters we were able to take the trams from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur then from Park MGM to Bellagio.  Bell Desk was a nightmare. We were told different things every day about checking luggage walker wheelchair or scooters. When we checked out one particular employee was rude to my sister and I but didn't seem to be with other guests who were male.  Overall I might stay again because I really liked the casino and the restaurants we tried.
40,Sand beach wave pool lazy river. Beautiful and fun. Great drinks food and staff. Room was clean. Bed was comfy. Shower was great. Good water pressure. Huge tub in room. Walkable location to walk the strip. And tram if u don’t feel like walking. Adjacent to stadium as well.
50,I’ve been to Vegas over 50 times and this was the easiest from start to finish. The mobile checkin was easy. Loved skipping the line at the front desk. Ultra convenient location for walking to Raiders game. Nice staff and clean rooms.
50,One our favorite resorts in Las Vegas. The rooms are very clean and nice. Mandalay Bay has the best pool in Las Vegas. You can relax on the Lazy river or play in the wave pool. The casino is big with a lot slots.
50,Nice location tons of restaurants on-site entertainment shopping. It’s like being on a luxury cruise ship..everything under one roof.  My only criticism is the storage fee for using the fridge/no complimentary coffee.
20,Why do you think you have a right to charge for coffee? Come on trying to increase profits? Are you kidding me?  Maybe coin operated Heat and Air or how about opening the blinds for the view?  Maybe coin operated lamps with timers?
10,We had to be relocated three times. Room 1. equipment failures. Room 2. Wrong size bed in the room change. Room 3. the bathroom was dirty neither of the sinks nor the tub drained properly. The tub had a soap scum line showing previous persons water level. and the tub pug was filty. We spots and ring stains on the counter. and the base framing around the shower was dirty.
50,Never experienced the quality of the service the quality of the amenities and the friendliness of the staff anywhere that we had stayed both in the US and other countries we had been to. Absolutely recommend to friends and will definitely consider coming back.
40,All is great employees friendly wave pool and lazy river pool great rooms are fantastic and all considering COVID impacts but comps we're not as expected (willing to change this review if comps change).
20,Room was oddly weird food was really bad it was unbelievable salty and just cheap there was a super trashy crowd here we were just excited to leave this hotel picking up our bags to go to the hospital took literally 25 minutes and the bell man there was super condescending. What a bad experience.
50,This hotel was by far the best we have been too! Great customer service friendly staff room was perfect decent price great view of city at night and hotel room was clean… Definitely going back on next trip. Love it
50,Mid week competitive room rates free parking with Pearl Membership with Mlife. Easy access from the freeway. Large rooms with comfortable beds and pillows. Plenty of good dining opportunities our favorites are RiRa Irish Pub and Border Grill. Nice roomy casino with new slots and nice atmosphere. Numerous pools wave pool and lazy river adjacent to the sand beach. Our favorite hotel on the Strip.
50,We were very happy with the Executive King room at the MB. It had a large sitting area along with an oversized bathroom. Bed was very comfortable. We also had a nice view up he LV Strip out our windows.
10,Paid a deposit on a king size bed for anniversary vacation. Get to the check in after a 10 hour day and told no king beds available. No discounts received. Told if we stay tonight a king bed will open up tomorrow. Stayed first night. Rooms are very noisy and couldn’t sleep from how stressed I was about their overbooking. Called guest services next morning at 9 am to ask when we will be moved to the king bed that was already paid for. Told no king rooms available all weekend. Did not offer to find new accommodations. Did not offer any sort of hotel discounts vouchers ride assistance. Absolutely pitiful the way they handled this experience. You have soooo many options to stay at a hotel on the strip so do yourself a favor and do not go to this one
50,"Whenever we go to Vegas we stay at the Mandalay Bay. It has the nicest staff and fun games to play. The only ""drawback"" is it is located on one end of the strip so any time we wanted to go someplace else for a visit we needed to walk or get a cab. But being on the end of the strip doesnt mean we didnt have things to do. The shops between Mandaly / Luxor/ and Excalibur and the restaurants are nice and provide most anything you could want.  Also the room service food was really good."
10,Disappointed in the attitude of some staff members no wash cloths (told there was a shortage) mold in the shower no hot water one morning A/C issue. Just very disappointed in the Mandalay Bay and concerned about all MGM properties.
40,The check in was ok but there was a long line. Not many staff at the check in counters. Check out was better because I used the kiosk.  I was on hold and couldn’t get through to room service the next morning so I hung up; which was a bummer. There was a hole in my sheets but the room was very clean. We didn’t have a great view but that was fine. The shower was great and I slept well!  The hotel is on the end of the strip so make sure you plan your walking route because I didn’t and spent more money than I wanted on Uber rides. Keep in mind that everywhere there are designated Uber pick ups.
40,The Mandalay Bay knows how to host large conferences and provide services to meet the needs of the business traveler from terrific meal options to outstanding customer service. It all comes at a steep price though from $12 water bottles to $20 for in-room coffee. Just because you can charge these kinds of prices for pretty basic amenities doesn't mean you should.
50,Stayed for long weekend in October. Room was very nice no complaints. ( we were on 21st floor and there was traffic noise from street and airplanes but that is to be expected. Our friends on the 39th floor in four seasons also had the traffic noise) Nice casino but very very smoky. Mask rules were in place and everyone complied. Nice to see. Sit down restaurants in the casino are very expensive- think: ribeye steak $86 and if you want a potato on side add $10. But hey there’s a Panda Express across street or del taco right down the strip a bit.
10,When I finally got to my room the mini fridge had leftover food shoved in it from the previous occupant.  There was a pair of men's underwear in between the bed and nightstand on the floor. There was an empty bottle of organic sleeping pills on the floor next to the other bed. So clearly this room was not even cleaned to regular standards let alone during a pandemic. This was not even close.
50,Room was super spacious! Bathroom was stunning. Loved the big bath tub. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Location wasn’t the most convenient and parking is super confusing but other than that had an amazing experience
10,All together a mess from digital keys to room service and lighting in the bathroom. Phone in the room wasn’t even working to address any issues had to run down and point them out. Most of the time there wasn’t even anyone to answer to you.
40,The property is in great proximity to Allegiant Stadium. You couldn't ask for better location. The rooms were clean and in great shape. I would have liked to have a few more choices for late night food.
50,The staff are friendly and consistently courteous. There are many dining options from fast to fancy. Easy access to and from the airport. The casino is clean and has wide variety of games for every one's desires.
50,I play MyVegas app and was lucky enough to earn the two night free reward comp so I chose Mandalay Bay and it was great! I loved the pool the staff was welcoming. My only issue was key cards not working regularly in the elevator.
50,Stayed here for a convention. The hotel was easy safe and clean. I had no issues with getting to my room or checking out. The bell service was easy to use. The location for rideshare was easy to find.
50,This was our first stay at The Mandalay Bay and I cannot find a single thing that wasn't great. The entire hotel was spotless including our room (which was quite large for a basic room along the strip). The staff at the front desk were outstanding as well as at each of the pools bars and clubs. Moorea Beach Club staff may have been the nicest crew we have ever encountered at a Vegas pool. The location is perfect and the tram running between 3 properties is very helpful. I really see no reason stay anywhere else.
50,Great place to stay as we celebrated our anniversary. Fun pool - get there early as guests do line up early to get in; don’t forget to take your keycard you can bring your own tube. Easy to go to the pool if you don’t bring any extra stuff so no need to worry about it being left at the chairs.
50,Great resort! I love the pools and restaurants. Just a wonderful place to stay. Raider fans were in numbers having a great time. Excellent staff. Walking distance to Allegiant Stadium - Go Raiders! You can’t make a better choice. Very clean with very comfortable beds.
40,Really enjoyed my stay even though short. Staff were very courteous and helped me whenever I needed something. I would stay again if price was right. It was a good launching pad for a day of fun before our family vacation in Arizona.
50,Was there for daughters wedding. Good facility. Only thing it is mot in middle of strip more towards the end. The property was well maintained. I had no problems there. Food was good with multiple choices of where to eat
40,It’s a nice place to stay if you’re convention is at Mandalay Bay.  The monorail does not go to Mandalay Bay so if your event is at the convention center you will need to ride share or taxi.  Rooms are nice mine was quiet.  No mini fridge so id you need one for your medications you must request one.  The mini fridges are weight sensitive.
50,We enjoyed every moment of our stay at Mandalay Bay! Checking in was quick and nearly effortless! All of the staff were super friendly and efficient! Our room was amazing! The arena was conveniently located inside the resort and it was only a short walk from the elevators. After an intense playoff game we were elated when our Phoenix Mercury WNBA team won! The comfortable and very luxurious bedding was clean and so very soft! The view is amazing and the blackout curtains work well! WARNING! DO NOT TOUCH the fridge or the fridge handle and DO NOT LOOK inside the fridge or you will be charged $50. The water and coffee are not complimentary. You will be charged for them. All prices are listed on the minibar menu when you turn on the TV. If you used the valet and parked your car overnight these charges will also appear on your account. Checking out with the TV is quick and easy! Room keys can be conveniently dropped off when you pick up your car at the valet pickup downstairs. You will not be dissapointed! We will be back again soon!
50,Took a short trip to celebrate! Was not disappointed!! Mandalay Bay is the best resort! Amazing service cleanliness and pools!! I would 100 percent recommend Mandalay Bay to anyone looking for a fun and classy time!
10,No hot water for showers. No water at all during the night just air coming out of the faucet. $50 charge to use the fridge! “ no joke) multiple false mini bar charges. Windows so dirty that you can’t even see out of them. Had to beg for toilet paper…
50,This was a trip planned in a week and it was amazing! Loved the extra precautions the staff took to protect their guest during this pandemic. The staff was super helpful and friendly. The rooms were very comfy as well.
50,Great restaurant selection onsite. Coffee and Breakfast available for quick service or sit down. Casino floor is just the right size you can't get lost. The beach and wave pool are a favorite! Loved reserving a Cabana great service!
50,This hotel is the best restaurants shows casino and rooms are super nice. The pool beach is also awesome. The bar just Latina night on Saturdays. I would recommend this hotel to anyone one of the best
50,We were going to stay at a different hotel but it was gross and disgusting. We stayed at the Mandalay Bay previously and loved it. So we quickly cancelled our reservation and got a room at Mandalay and thank goodness because It was so relaxing and clean! Loved it!
50,This was my first time staying at Mandalay Bay and I was truly impressed with my stay!!! From the phenomenal room to the exceptional beach style pool. The wave pool is now the best pool in Vegas hands down!!!!
20,"I booked an executive King room and I got room 16-201. The view was great and the restroom was roomy and beautiful. However there was trash in the ice bucket and that was gross. The TV in the room kept turning off and on. That was a little creepy. And the water was off in the middle of my husband's shower. When we called the front desk they told us that water wouldn't be back on until 6am. My husband needed to finish his shower so we agreed to a room change. They moved us to a ""better room"" 59-118 was supposed to be nicer. It was not. It was weirdly appointed with ""aromatherapy devices"" which didn't seem like they worked and a tube added to the shower head for an aromatherapy shower effect. The view was also not as expected. It was no longer a beautiful strip view but a view of the airport. Hmmm....not a ""better room"" in my opinion. Also. I had a food credit of $75 and one for $50 that was very difficult to use. I was told to charge the meal to the room and that they would take it out of the bill. I was not told there was a time limit to the food credit. I received the room bill and they did not apply the food credit. Why?"
40,"We wanted a quick get-away with a nice pool. The pool area was beautiful! But.....they required us to purchase tubes ($30) for the lazy river. so....we opted to float without a tube! It was pretty funny...but not ideal. The ""lazy"" river was anything but!! Also I am accustomed to complimentary coffee in my room. We were charged $6/cup for the in-room coffee ( it was marginal) and powdered creamer...not my fave. All in all it was a lovely stay!"
50,Always a great stay! The pool(s) are amazing and the staff is excellent. The casino floor is nice and big with lots of variety. We love the location fits our style. Only downside is that the Burger Bar was closed.
50,The hotel is an awesome hotel to stay in. The hotel room was spacious and clean. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The hotel had everything you needed (restaurants night clubs live DJ great drinks casino and entertainment). The staff was courteous and informative.
50,I had a wonderful experience checking in at the Mandalay Bay. Erin Eden was so attentive and courteous to all my families needs. She made check in so easy and when traveling with my 84yr. old mother with dementia it can be very difficult and she was so kind to my whole family.
50,Loved. Our room and are stay at your casino everyone was friendly and helpful first time staying at your casino and would love to come again our friends stayed at another casino but after coming over to see our room and the casino said they wished they had stay at yours
30,Good evening.    After about a half hour debacle of trying to extend (mind you we had our kids with us and had just come from the pool) yes Michael finally extended us under our rate from yesterday.    Though I am completely familiar with hotel occupancy demand rate fluctuations group sales etc. it was quite disappointing to see your front desk personnel act so rudely when we inquired about a stay over rate.    I am a player development manager for a casino in California and if a team member or manager acted the way I was treated today I’d be embarrassed.    We aren’t your huge spenders or gamblers. We were in town for a baseball tournament for our 10 year old son and our kids wanted nothing more than to enjoy another day at your resort and pool. The winds picked up pretty bad around 2 which is why we stopped by the front desk to ask about staying over.    My husband and kids were then sad and confused with having to stand over a half hour at your front desk with our suits on. It was almost like the agent and manager didn’t care. And maybe they don’t.    Anyways long story short. We went up to the room to pack our belongings and head home. I called the front desk and they charged me $70 extra now that it was “4pm”. At this point I was tired and just wanted to leave so I didn’t put up a fight.    Oh and by the way the ice machine was done the entire time on the 59th floor 💦 our room keys didn’t allow us to go to another floor either 😢    I do want to give a huge compliments to Melissa who checked us in. She was FABULOUS! She chatted made us feel welcome and even made a connection with my kids. That energy was what we were expecting today.
40,Typical Vegas hotel. Nice but nothing special. Love the tram to Excalibur. Visited New York New York to ride the coaster and common/casino areas seemed way more fun and teen friendly. Will stay there next time!
10,The rooms are not worth the cost they are dirty small and have paper thin walls. I will never be staying here again. The machines on the floor also don't seem to have decent payouts and room service food is expensive and Cafeteria like.
50,1st time staying at this resort. The property exceeded our expectations; we will be returning for sure! Booked for the Beach experience but loved the whole property. Location is at the FAR END of the strip so visiting other hotels/casinos/shows/restaurants was less convenient but that was really the only real down side of staying at Mandalay Bay.
50,Return guests for 16 years. Never had a bad stay and already booked next trip for 2-22. The property and people are bar none the best in the city. Good to see them back open and rebounding from the pandemic in the safest way they possibly can.
10,Recieved room with pieces missing from mini bar and they tried to charge me. Previous visitor left pills behind and cleaners didnt remove them prior. Not a friendly staff and elevators worked half of the time. Service didnt work for cell phones that were needed for business.
50,Mandalay Bay is a beautiful property. Very spacious . Loved the tropical setting and fountains. The pool and beach complex is amazing. The free tram to Excalibur helps with getting around . From there you are next to New York New York and MGM Grand.
50,I love just about everything about MB…..the rooms the restaurants the casino and the POOLS! Plus I have never met a staff person who hasn’t been friendly and accommodating. I can’t wait until me next visit.
50,Had a great stay at Mandalay Bay. The service was great and casino staff was excellent. Poker room and craps table also a great experience. The only issue was using the cell phone app in the elevator which did not seem to work. I was told due to wifi issues. Otherwise everything was excellent.
50,If your attending a Raiders game this is the place! Great Restaurant’s and easy to get to and from the game. We did have a strong sewer smell coming from the toilet and didn’t get much help on that so only used it in emergency but the rest of the stay there was great!
20,Employee walked into my room on check out day at 9 am. Check out wasn’t until 11 and I was undressed. Thankfully husband stop them before they entered any further into room. Told staff upfront and nothing but sorry is what i received.
10,Overpriced incompetent staff ruined my vacation no water at all last day couldn't flush toilet take a shower anything I looked at stuff in mini bar was charged for everything nobody actually does inventory it's all electronic and very overpriced
50,Beautiful resort with a great pool. Stayed 4 nights & was very happy. Customer service is great and very accommodating. Bring a cooler with water. You are billed $50 per day to use the refrigerator. I will definitely go back.
20,There was literally no water for the shower the air conditioning sounded like a mac truck and when I tried to call for assistance I was hung up on multiple times. The coffee and water in the room will set you back $20 each ...... no complimentary items here.....and whatever you do DO NOT TOUCH the minibar. Even opening it will generate a $50 charge. Basically this is a bare bones hotel that nickel and dimes you to death.
30,Too many unnecessary fee !  Parking in room water coffee in room resort fee that we didn’t use and tax on resort fee . I wouldn’t stay there if there again. Service not so great at front desk. Restaurant was good . That’s the only plus to the experience
30,We had serious plumbing issues and the smell that came from the shower was terrible. We also didn’t have hot water the last day of our stay which was very inconvenient. The staff never tried to call back and follow up on our issues
30,Nothing was technically wrong with my stay but lines were long at check in toilet area smelled mildly like a sewer the $32 a day resort fee doesn’t include water (or much else for that matter) and the housekeeping was inconsistent (e.g. took away two soaps left one in their place…). Room was fine nothing special but you would think at least with the health conscious “Live Well” room upgrade that they’d give a bottle of water since you’re in the desert but nothing is free I’m afraid!
50,I truly enjoyed my stay at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. very fun casino great rooms great restaurants cool convention center friendly staff. We loved our stay in Las Vegas. We also loved the pool area and the concert we went to poolside.
30,Rooms and hallways smell of smoke. Charging $12 for a cup of coffee in your room where it is usually a free amenity- really?!? And be careful not to move the cups because even if you don't use them you are billed the $12. Very deceitful in my opinion.
50,Mandalay Bay was amazing to stay in as usual. The room was clean and organized room service and house keeping were great and attentive. we had no hassle to check in or out using the app was easy to manage.
50,Big Clean Rooms. Casino area is nice and easy to find machines you like to play. Great Restaurant Selection. Good Price Points on Rooms. Helpful staff. Elevators are quick parking / rideshare is easy to locate.
10,We checked in for a business conference. The rooms were not clean and the entire section of the building needs a remodel. Plus the mobile app doesn't allow you to check in with two rooms. Mandatory for a business trip!
10,Worst stay I've ever had. No one cared to fix my issue. Paid extra to get a non basic room and was placed in a basic room. I wasn't offered my money back. Now I'm waiting to see if they are going to over charge my deposit fees
40,It was the first of many combined Raiders/Golden Knights trip. I have stayed at the Mandalay Bay before and I always enjoyed my stay. The employees are friendly. My only knock is that I wish there would be more vegetarian and vegan options in the restaurant areas.
20,Very poor water pressure in shower & very little hot water. Worn out & uneven mattress. Rooms look & feel old. At the far end of the strip so a lot of walking required (or Uber). Very convenient location if going to a game at allegient stadium.
50,If been to other MGM properties this one better kept up. Rooms were updated and clean casino floor was layer out perfectly and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I be back for another vacation!
40,I stayed many times at this property. It is getting a little stale but still OK. I understand the challenges but charging $20 for water and $12 for coffee (I think) is not going to help. Also it is great to have all this info at your fingertips (via the TV remote) but if the remote does not work well it is a waste of time.
40,Good hotel. Rooms are spacious. Immediate check-in if you download the app. My parents and I got a room with two queen beds. Plenty of room. Big bathroom. However I reserved for 3 people. But there was shampoo and soap for 1. No hand towels! Two bath towels.  Used one bottle of Aquiafina water from the bar and was charged $20! If u order room service there is $9 delivery charge which does not include a tip and takes them an hour to bring you the food. Bring ur own water or buy it from the shop by the elevator.  The resort is huge. Nice pool area. Not too crowded and barely any kids running around which was nice. There is a 15 minute walk to get to where the strip and all the action is. The free tram is nice and takes you to Excalibur which is closer to all the stores. But tram closes at midnight!
50,Great stay beautiful rooms. loved the large bath tube. only thing you need to make time for is the pool closes early at 6pm. make sure to make it down to the pools before they close. Love that is so closes to the stadium.
50,It's not just a resort fee it is a true resort experience. Our son got married as a destination wedding and all the families stayed at Mandalay Bay. We love the bed the room the staff the casino Citizen's was our go to! 2 Starbucks and the Mexican Restaurant onsite is the BEST!
20,Located at the far end of the strip MB is a hike to get anywhere. This would be fine if they provided a space you wanted to stay in but the room was dirty (used bandaids half drank items in mini bar crumbs on floor) casino environment was dead and staff was generally unpleasant
40,Stayed at Mandalay for my birthday weekend. Room was clean however we initially had to request towels as none were in the room when we arrived. Room was a good size for us with lots of room to spread out. Lots of food options on property however all options are a little pricey. If you are going for a Raiders game this is a great option as you can walk to the stadium from this hotel. However if you are going to the strip this is the last hotel on the strip so depending on where you want to go on the strip it is a pretty good walk. Did spa service and it was a good experience. Currently you can only use spa if you are receiving services. Had a strip view so could definitely hear the noise of cars driving down the strip but it was too bad.
50,The pool was excellent! The rooms are very clean and nicely decorated. We stayed at the pool all day had d drinks and food. Ordered from Border's Grill and it was good food. The shrimp ceviche is amazing!
50,The room was very beautiful. The staff were all very nice. They had great amenities as well. I enjoyed my stay at the Mandalay Bay and I will be coming back. I experienced a couple of other locations during my trip and Mandalay Bay was the one that impressed us the most.
10,Check in was fine got to room no towels first off called down waited 30 minutes no towels I went down manger couldn’t get ahold of housekeeping very dissatisfied and disappointed went to my son room to get a towel just wanted to take a shower after a 5 hour drive. Night was fine till I woke up with bite marks on me changed room and ended up with hair all over the room in my bed tub sink told front desk nothing happened change sheets myself and cleaned room myself will never go back to Mandalay Bay
30,We traveled with another couple for my husbands 40th birthday. We checked in through the app and said we would be arriving early  While that didn’t guarantee an early check in I was pleasantly surprised by an alert that our room was ready early about 10am. Our friends checked in at the hotel and we were down the hall from each other. In comparison our room seemed to be rushed through as we did not have hand towels and was missing a welcome letter with a hand sanitizer pack. The missing pack wasn’t a big deal but the difference in the rooms little touches made ours seem rushed. Wish they would have taken the extra time to make sure the room was on point. Also one of our friends knocked over the snacks on the counter. Bags were never touched or opened just knocked over $28 charge on the bill 😞
50,Everything was great definitely will be coming back. Good live bands and bars. Cigar shop is was very nice good selection. Access to Alegent Stadium was so close . I recommend Mandalay Bay Casino for your stay for sure.
20,The room is dirty. The shower has mold and the bath tub has hair. Look like nobody did deep cleaning at all. We stayed for only one night. Both of table lamps are not working. However the room decoration is nice. We liked the window curtains. They have nice restaurants. We are not coming back.
50,We stayed at the Luxor. Played at the pool day one. Gambled some. Casino was loud music and close quarters. Day two took the walkway to Mandalay Bay. What a difference! The atmosphere gaming floor and amenities were amazing. Spent some time at one of the bars with bartender Joe from Michigan. He kept us entertained for a couple of hours with his stories. Great hospitality! Had to go back the next day to see Joe. Same great service and personality. He's been there 17 years! We will be staying at Mandalay Bay next trip.
50,This use to be my primary resort to stay at before I moved to las vegas! The MB facility is extremely large and has so much to offer and it is conveniently close to the airport as well! There is an enormous convention area a large arena the house of blues a nightclub and many fine lounge bars and restaurants throughout the building. They have an incredible pool area that sponsors concerts on the beach series during the warm weather months. There is a very popular family location called the shark reef. Although MB is a very large hotel/casino there are well marked signs to give you directions and a very good customer service experience here. They have a beautiful wedding chapel an incredible spa and an unlimited number of activities for people of all ages. This facility is considered a host venue for all of the Allegiant Stadium venues which is located across the interstate and very short walking distance. There is a tram that runs from MB to the luxor and excaliber hotels but I am not sure if or when it is running currently? The famous Las Vegas city sing for photo shoots is nearby and there are some good shopping shots here and an outlet mall down the street. I really could not find any negative comments about this location. jefferson lee-amazon book author
50,Had a great stay. Front desk staff upgraded my room upon asking at check in and then downgraded it the next day after realizing we weren't going to be in it much. No problem. Only negative is the location on the strip. We averaged 15 miles walked each day for 5 days but we are young so it's not an issue. Would stay here again!
50,Very nice atmosphere! Had a very nice stay and the room was fantastic. Parking was great. Staff was very helpful! Can't wait to return when we get past this Pandemic and get back to normal living. All in all we had a very good time
20,We stayed at Mandalay Bay mainly for the pool it looked amazing from all the research I did before our trip. The pool was nice but I don’t believe it was worth it with the cost of food/drinks and the overall experience we had at the hotel. Our first room we quickly reported the lack of cleanliness and were moved to another room. There were nail clippings and a used nail file on the carpet… so gross! The staff gave us a $25/person food credit for our inconvenience. The second room was cleaner but I noticed some fecal matter between the toilet seat and lid of the toilet. Also gross and makes me wonder the cleaning practices of the hotel. The fact that they charge $12 for a cup (technically two cups) of coffee in your room is crazy! They provide the coffee maker but not the coffee? Weird. The food options in the hotel are not great and don’t offer a very wide variety for families. No microwave in the room and you are not allowed to use the fridge unless you want a $50 charge (because the overpriced minibar occupies the fridge) but that is my fault for not researching that better before our trip. Overall it was a nice hotel but for the price I think I would look elsewhere.
10,Dog barked throughout night for the first 3 nights. Was apparently not the only patron that was kept up as we heard another guest scream in hallway at around 3am that she just wants to get some sleep. Carpet and chairs in the room were stained and appeared worn.
10,They overbooked us on our wedding trip. Spent 40 min crying in the lobby and no one even tried to help. They just said “there is nothing to be done”. Worst experience of my life. Cold robotic staff with no empathy.
50,With all the choices Las Vegas has to offer Mandalay is a relaxing comfortable venue with a cleaner vibe than most of Vegas and the beach with cabanas is simply the best Las Vegas has to offer. They also seem to be upgrading the property as it starts to age keeping it fresh!
50,This hotel is quite luxurious the pool area is for kids and adults. One of the hotels where you can enjoy the pool area the shark aquariam wave pool lazy river many pools and hot tub.    property in general is nice and clean and smells good. lots of security around.
50,From check in to check out we were extremely grateful for the whole hotel and casino staff. There was a clear collaborative effort to serve as examples by adhering to the health and safety protocols.
30,Elevators are super slow the keycards randomly get shut off to the rooms and it takes several tries to scan the keycard to the elevator. Hotel prices are outrageous. You're mini fridges are completely useless stuffed with a bunch of crap I don't need or want and I can't put my own things inside of it. At least put in a second fridge for guest for left over and beverages! Completely ridiculous.
50,The staff makes up for any small hiccup which I didn't have any problems. Front desk was having some kind computer issue but they went out their way to make sure I'm all good. Which I Am!! Love love Love
10,Check In Staff does not care to assist they just want to tack on as many extra charges as possible. And then they want you to go away from the front desk. None of the staff seem to care or offer any assistance. Everyone seem annoyed when asked a question or if you requested anything. The room was not serviced and dirty laundry bag was left outside my room from initial checkin through my stay and was even there during checkout date. Hotel is also far off the strip closer to the airport. Next time definitely going to Aria Vdara or Bellagio.
50,The rooms were nice. The bathroom had a really nice bath for the wife. The staff was all friendly. We ended up the rhythm & riffs bar everynight due to staff drinks and reasonably priced. The location at the end of the strip may not be ideal but the tram to excalibur and the monorail at MGM grand made it bearable along with uber/lyft. Also the bell service was excellent with the employees actually making conversation without it feeling forced. Looking forward to coming back as well as checking out other MGM properties.
30,I wouldn't use the mobile app... I checked in electronically on the app and had pending charges for my 3 night stay of over $17k maxing out my available credit limit on that card and ruining my experience in Las Vegas.
50,Attended for an industry conference and was very pleased with the property overall. Plenty of after-work dining options and activities. The rooms were modern and clean. I wasn't able to use the outdoor beach area but it looked like a lot of fun.
20,It feels sad & dated overly loud music like they’re trying to appeal to a young get crowd but they wanted to hang & talk with their friends not be deafened into silence by a DJ in a restaurant where there us no dance floor.
10,The hotel's business model is obviously to squeeze out as much money as possible from guests wile they're on the property. $50 to use the refrigerator have to pay for coffee in your room etc. You get better free services at a Motel 6.
50,Beautiful resort with a fantastic view. Hotel room was spacious clean and comfortable. Lots of restaurants to pick from and easy to navigate around from casino to rooms. Check in and out was super quick and easy.
50,"Highly recommend Mandalay for amazing pool areas great view & cleanliness! My suggestions are make sure to join M-Life for better service experience check in online to save time and book a ""Stay Well"" room for a great view and better air quality in the room. It's a long walk from self-parking garage to front desk and elevator to the rooms so drop off your bags with someone at the front of the hotel and then park...or use VALET it's worth it! Bring a cooler for your drinks if you don't want to be charged for items you use from the frig. If you'd rather bring you own inflatable tube they have an electric pump you can use otherwise purchase one for $25. The food is reasonable priced but the big alcoholic drinks are $30 each!! It was only a 10-minute walk to the Fashion Show Mall. At times I wished hotel was located in the middle of the strip and not have to drive or use Uber to other hotels for the rides at NY NY and Stratosphere."
50,Loved our stay at Mandalay Bay! Room was beautiful on 60 floor with view of the strip. We even left the drapes open at night to appreciate the view. The soaking tub felt so good after wearing out my feet walking and walking. Loved the pool especially the lazy river that my husband and I both enjoyed!  It’s a huge property and we did have a little trouble finding our way around. Everyone was very helpful however.
50,love how clean the resort was and the pool was amazing as far as a lot of pool options and seating. By the way Mandalay bay had the best pool party. I also like the idea of having a food court on-premises with reasonable pricing . there was a variety of food options.
10,Tired facility. Nickle and dimes you every step of the way. From the minute you arrive you are being (over) charged for everything from parking to mini bar items ($14 for a bottle of water???). Can't rent a pool float. Have to buy one for $30. MGM is taking all the fun out of coming to Vegas. They also had a pool party which went until 11pm which literally rattled the windows from the sound system. Never staying there again.
20,Staff from check in was unfriendly. I called to ask if there was transportation from airport to hotel and was told to take Uber. Foundation room charges even if you are a guest and casino employees look depressed and rush you. I paid for a king sized room overlooking strip and received a room on the 10th floor which saw the strip but with what I was paying the view could have been a lot better.
10,My room is dirty upon check in it looks like sand or silly string everywhere on the floor they didn't have any other available rooms to check me into the entire time I stayed there was proposing to my girlfriend of 10 years was told by reservation staff that they had put a specific room number assignment so I would get the highest floor possible facing the pool but when we get there the room is dirty we're on the 12th floor facing the parking structure of Delano maybe you shouldn't say that if you can't do that and come through and promise someone in room I even told him I would pay extra to assure that room and they told me it's not a problem they can do it. Pool service horrible Priscilla where did you go with our drinks and food you never came back 2 hours later we had to go we were waiting for you food for four people The first day we saw you you ignored us and walked by us so we were kind of hesitant when we found out that you were our server. Check in was easy I did all that on mobile check-in which is highly recommendable.
20,A once fine resort it suffers now from age and bad staff attitudes. There is no caring or kindness anywhere. Even by Vegas standards it’s overpriced (especially food and bev). Pool closes at 6pm making it unusable if there for a conference.
50,The Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino was an ideal stay for the Dolphins - Raiders game. Allegiant Stadium is a short 20-minute walk across the pedestrian bridge connecting the hotel and stadium. There's good signage directing pedestrian traffic through the resort to the bridge.    The resort itself is nicely laid out and fairly easy to navigate given its size. Restaurants are above average to high end and tend to be clustered in areas that make sense relative to the casino space.    Rooms are modern clean spacious and comfortable. Housekeeping and hotel staff are friendly and efficient. Ice and sundries are conveniently located.    Check-out was easy via an app on the room TV but check-in was slow and seemed understaffed - disappointing after a long day's travels. A phone app for check-in was ineffective and useless.    Otherwise we were pleasantly surprised with our stay at the Mandalay Bay. I can certainly recommend the resort to couples and families visiting Las Vegas especially if they plan to attend an event at the nearby stadium or arena.
50,I won this trip in a slot tournament at Empire City casino in New York. I had a wonderful time at Mandalay Bay and the staff and personnel were friendly helpful and efficient. The king room was nice and spacious and contained a jacuzzi. The many restaurants and shops and tram/train made it easy to accomplish shopping dining and gambling
50,Check in and check out very easy even though it was a very busy weekend. Used the remote check in and then picked up keys at the desk as we like to have keys and not use our phones. Room was clean and exactly what we wanted. Used room service and then ate at a few restaurants-all were very good. House of Blues opened renovated area while we were there-Very Nice!! Fun trip with family who were staying at another MGM property but had no issues getting around. Can’t wait for our next visit!
30,It's a very nice hotel if your company is paying for it. I would not stay here on my own. I was charged sixty dollars in drinks I did not drink and refuted it and was not given it all back - only twenty given back. I didn't even drink anything. They said because I put my own water bottle in the fridge and they way the fridge. Would have been nice to have a warning about that.
40,I was asked if I wanted a room near the elevator and if I wanted a pool view or the strip view. I got a room with a pool view at the end of the hall. Nothing what I wanted. Complete opposite. Very disappointing.
50,We come to Vegas often and we always try to stay at Mandalay Bay. The rooms are always very clean not to mention big. We love the restaurant options at Mandalay Bay. The mall that connects to Luxor also has great restaurants!
50,Mandalay Bay has the best pool in Vegas especially for the kids. Room was very spacious and pool view was great from 58th floor. Very good customer service. Definitely recommend this hotel especially if you are travelling with kids.
20,We stayed 4 nights at Mandalay Bay hotel and they never came to clean the room or take the trash or bring the clean towels!!! We called them but they never came!!! Eventually I took care of all trash and cleaned the room!!!!
50,We had a great stay! Our suite was very nice and housekeeping made it very clean . The hotel staff is helpful and friendly. The casino floor is spread out people are not too close while you play. Check in and check out was easy. I would certainly recommend this hotel.
50,Comfy beds and appointments. Housekeeping never came during the 2 full days I was there but no big deal. Room service came very fast though! Quiet rooms. Wish there were a double lock on the door or a chain.
50,We had a wonderful time. Stayed in an amazing Skyview penthouse suite-probabthe nicest room we’ve ever stayed in on the Strip. Every restaurant we ate in was superb even just for breakfast! We only play slots and had a lot of fun and some nice wins as well!
50,I had the best time at Mandalay Bay I came to attend the Aces and Raiders vs Ravens game…walking distance to everything I wanted to do!! Room was beautiful overlooking the Vegas Strip. Only hiccup the lock on the inside of my trim door was broken needing a battery Security fixed it in a bunk of an eye.
20,Cheesy to charge for watwr and coffee at the prices you pay for a room. It ws very inconvienient and seemed very cheap on their part. Also if you wanted to use the fridge you would have to pay an additional charge crazy!
10,Hotel is trying to go towards digital but the infrastructure doesn’t support it (some lifts don’t accept digital  Key).  Hotel food is below average esp for the price.  Sat on slot machines for 2hours and not even 1 waitress came over to ask for drinks! :-/
50,Great location and 5 star service! Very first hotel on the south strip. Free tram available to Luxor and Excalibur. Multiple pools including wave pool and lazy river. Great restaurants and shops available and easy walk to Allegiant Stadium
50,Service was top notch customer service was prompt when needed. I thought that the staff did their best to keep everyone clean and safe without being pushy or annoying. Having to type 200 characters on this review is annoying.
40,Can’t really go wrong with Mandalay Bay especially for the price location and amenities. Easy Check in and out. Digital keys and great app. Multiple pools. Check restaurant availability and make reservations because some are closed a couple of days right now and they get very booked. Restaurants expensive so if on a budget there are some food court options. Close to many other walkable hotels for dining and entertainment variety Don’t expect an amazing view if on airport side…but again price makes up for that. Your at the very end of the strip across from the airport so fast $30 cab ride.
50,We had a lovely time at the Mandalay Bay. The staff were wonderful the room was lovely and the pools were relaxing and beautiful. We especially loved the lazy river. If you can bring your own floatie it's worth it because you can blow it up there. It costs 30$ to buy one at the pool. We thought the hours for the pool were too short. They only open from 9:00 to 6:00.
50,Thanks again for transforming a fun trip into an epic one.    Service is a rare quality these days and Sebastian at the Mandalay delivers in spades. He exceeded my grandest expectations and he delivered twice during our brief interactions.    Many thanks to the staff for restoring my hope that service is still a hallmark of hospitality. From managing small details like sending an extra refrigerator to my room for entertaining guest to clutch reservations after I missed my flight simply thank you. I’m still impressed how I was greeted with surprise by-name at the front desk after I should have been long gone on my flight back to the east coast.    Mandalay Bay will certainly be my first choice for my next trip to Las Vegas and I hope to see Sebastian running the front desk!
20,The room itself was nice but they had NO WASH CLOTHS. Walls are super thin so the room next door coming in at 4am wasn’t so fun to wake up to. It is super far from the other casinos if you are trying to casino hop and there aren’t a lot of tables to game in the casino (lots of slots if you are into that).
40,On arrival it was a little rough because the valet staff were not very friendly when we got to the hotel. Check-in was ok but the line did seem overwhelming and took about 10 min to get through. Check-in desk staff was really friendly.    The problem with this hotel is if you have friends on other floors you can’t get to their floor with your key even as a hotel guest. Market is awesome and so is the Libertine takeout window.    Bathroom fixtures were broken so shower and tub was a little wonky. Two bath towels for guests is too few. So is the single set of shampoo and shower gel.
30,Great place summer time if you have kids that love water activities or if your going to a Raiders game (10 min walk to stadium) It is the last hotel on the strip long way to everything else. Check-in can be difficult at times long lines rooms not ready until late in the afternoon. It is EXPENSIVE for everything from beers ($9 domestic) to soft drinks ($6 bottle) candy snacks etc. better restaurants at other hotels.
40,Unbelievable rate the rooms are a little outdated. I attended a conference and had a great stay at Mandalay Bay. The staff all remained masked and even greeted me in the halls to the elevators. I would stay again for business
20,Online reservation was for a King Check-in staff stated online only reserves room size and bed choice is not accurate. No wash cloths to wash face. Called Room services and was on hold for over 10 minutes until hung up. Washroom door does close so family would be woken up when you attempted to close the door that would not shut.
10,Room was nice staff was very friendly. It's just sad that they aren't up to Motel 6 standards as far as offering a mini fridge you can actually use. Mini fridges with weight sensors that auto charge you for bumping something is insanity.
30,Never got to shave despite really wanting to. Also pretty sure my room phone was broken as I couldn't really hear anything half the time. Also my initial room was given to someone else for some reason?
10,We were unable to check in until 4:30 PM and I literally had to argue with the person at the front desk. Upon check-in we didn’t get the room we paid for and reserved. The sink was clogged no wash cloths a lot of items in the room were broken and repeated calls to the front desk for assistance went unanswered
50,Great place to have some simple fun and chill experience. Had an excellent time just walking around the other resorts and the strip. The room was clean staff was very friendly and the cleaners were on point. Would love to stay there again!
10,"In the 1st room (Room 57-307) we were excited to be at your property as this was our first stay at Mandalay Bay. We unpacked and somewhat settled in then I had to leave to attend to some business activities. While I was gone my wife decided to go explore the Mandalay Bay areas when she discovered that our room door would not lock. My wife contacted the Front Desk to have the door repaired. She was told the locksmith was gone for the day and she would need to go to the Front Desk with all of our belongings to obtain a different room. She was not offered any assistance from hotel staff for this inconvenience. She proceeded to the Front Desk with all of our belongings to obtain a different room.    In the 2nd room (Room 58-112) my wife noticed the distinct smell of smoke. Again she contacted the Front Desk to alert them to the smell of smoke in this room. She was told that they would contact Housekeeping to fix the problem but did not offer to relocate us to another room. After waiting in the smoke-smelling room for 15-20 minutes my wife walked back down to the Front Desk and politely suggested that maybe the Front Desk person could find another room for us while Housekeeping was working to deodorize the room for use at another date. The Front Desk attendant found the 3rd room for us.    The 3rd room (Room 12-331) seemed much better but still missed the mark by a longshot for what we thought was a 5-Star resort. The lamp on one nightstand did not work seemingly a burned-out bulb. In looking at it closer I found that it was not plugged into the outlet. However the reason it wasn't plugged into the outlet was that someone had removed the outlet and placed a solid cover over the junction box. The ""funny"" thing about it is someone left a power strip attached to the lamp cord so someone knows about the lamp not working but just left it all lying there on the floor. I ran the cord and power strip from the nightstand across the floor to the opposite wall to the outlet behind the false wall used by the coffee-maker and plugged it in. The lamp worked fine but it was a little unsightly apparently not too unsightly for this Las Vegas strip motel.    These occurrences might happen to a frequent traveler over the span of a year but certainly not to one couple at one hotel during one stay especially when that one hotel is a top-of-the-line resort known around the world. Our first stay at Mandalay Bay was not conducive to a high recommendation to friends family social media or anyone for that matter."
30,Casino floor bar: ordered two drinks one with Malibu and one with Tito’s Vodka (supposedly out of Grey Goose). Made wrong drink ended up paying WAY TOO much for two drinks and after left realized neither had “Malibu or Tito’s “. Easy to tell on the Vodka. Bartender (older gentleman George maybe…who liked to tell riddles) screwed us on our drinks. Wife wanted to complain we just moved on. Mandalay lost out on a lot of $$$; didn’t buy another drink in Mandalay during entire stay. Overall needs life back in resort; it’s falling short
10,Had to wait 2 hours/3 waiting on luggage got delaied for the convention due to that had no service or wifi bell desk had me go down and find my luggage from the basment it was the worst experice ive rver had at a hotel
30,Mobile check-in was a no-go. Elevator wouldn't read the app. Frustrating when you arrive late and just want to get to the room.    Our room card reader broke and it took a day to get it fixed during which time we couldn't access our room with the room cards. Had to jam the door open with a crushed plastic water bottle. Comical.    Another couple in our party couldn't get soap in their room for 4 days. Housekeeping said they were out for 4 days. Our friends ended up using shampoo for soap and eventually took soap from our room.    The restaurant staff were awesome.
50,The hotel staff is very accommodating and helpful and friendly. The casino staff is great and I like to gamble here. Housekeeping makes sure the room is clean and fresh. Check in and check out is easy.
30,The main problem was sleeping at night..for 3 straight nights one of them being my wedding day was woken up at 3;30 am 🤬i called and asked for help and I didn't really get the help..so that sucked..its very smokey and things are extremely expensive..dont think I will come back for a very long time if ever again.
30,Not happy with the price of room. Showers were not cleaned properly hair still on the shower walls rooms smelled like pot and the only thing good about room was beds were sort of comfortable. Wish is would have had a different hotel.
50,Our family of five had two adjoining rooms w/ two queen beds in each on the 22nd floor. The rooms were spacious and super clean beds were comfy & pools were busy but not overly crowded. Coming and going from the hotel via taxi and Uber/Lyft was very convenient.
50,Great hotel. Attended for a conference and spent most of my time inside. They have great restaurants and entertainment. The Michael Jackson Cirque du Solei show is outstanding. I'm so glad I went to see it.
40,Very enjoyable experience. Rooms were extremely comfortable & clean. The staff is very helpful and accommodating. The pools are amazing and clean! Nice for a bit of normalcy during this pandemic. Looking forward to coming back to Mandalay.
40,Last minute I booked a stay at Mandalay Bay. The casino and pool were amazing. The rooms had very comfortable beds with quite floors which made it so easy to sleep in. The room was clean with the exception of small stuff that wouldn't catch the normal eye. The only down side is Mandalay Bay is at the end of the strip. In my personal opinion I feel Mandalay Bay is perfect for a family trying to get away and not get wrapped up in in the craziness further down the strip.
20,The hotel casino smells very badly & the room amenities are the cheapest they could buy such as the hair dryers magnifying mirrors sheets decor furniture etc. The property is in desperate need a facelift.
50,This is a great hotel with wonderful staff and a lot of good food options. Went with friends for the rice festival and everybody had a wonderful time. Would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again
30,Mandalay Bay is nice enough if you have to stay there for a conference or to attend an event. Although you will find a much cheaper rate elsewhere if you are willing to walk/taxi/uber. If you want to be in the middle of the excitement of Vegas I suggest that you find someplace more centrally located on the strip (You'll probably pay the same or less for a much nicer room too.)
40,Overall my wife and I had a good stay. Only problem I had with the entire stay was the parking. Parking for guests should be included. It’s stupid I have to pay to park at the hotel in which I’m staying at.
30,Wedding weekend got suite and curtains didn't work a/c was constantly making weird noises and breaker kept blowing when you tried to turn on bathroom light. Valet and Housekeeping were amazing though. Nice hotel very clean and pretty inside.
30,Stayed at Days Inn that had better Wifi. Overall the room was fine but nothing special. For the price could have stayed at a much nicer casino/hotel. We were somewhat stuck to stay here as a conference was here. Only thing that made it bearable was the staff.
50,Beautiful room very clean and spacious. Easy check in and out with the app. Had an excellent time. Bed was comfortable and room did a good job keeping out noise. Casino was nice pretty good live band playing on weekend.
30,The room was clean but very noisy at night. There was loud gurgling noises coming from the tub and sinks...ALL NIGHT LONG. Enough to wake you up. They appeared to be very short staffed for the bars and restaurants and the wait to get a drink was very lengthy. The spa treatments were good and the pool day was relaxing.
50,Love the hotel so big you won't see everything. Friendly staff and rooms are great.greatly. the casino was wonderful and we won money. The restaurant food was good. Must go eat at seabreeze and the strip steak.
40,Everything was wonderful as always! I usually stay at the Mandalay as it is close to the airport and has everything that makes for a great stay. Saw Bruno Mars this trip at the Park MGM and had a blast.
50,Service was very quick when needed. We asked do more towels and toilet paper and it came right away! (Mind you it was 12-1am) The room was very clean when we arrived. Even though we came early (1pm) our room was already done. The digital key was hard to figure out physical key worked much better and efficient
50,This was a great business trip! Staff was friendly and provided excellent support and services. The entire staff went out of their way to ensure everything was excellent and everyone in my party was happy!
50,We enjoyed our stay at Mandalay Bay Resort. The pool area fun and refreshing. Only downfall was you have to purchase your own tube to float on the lazy river (expensive float). Wait service was good until it got busy then a little slow but worth the wait.
40,Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino was a great stay as usual. Lots of fun things to do and see. Slots a little tight but other than that I had a great time. Saw Michael Jackson One show and it was AMAZING!!!!!!!! Would definitely see show again.
20,They are short staffed. I feel for businesses. The room was dirty when I checked in. I tried calling the front desk and was on hold for 15 minutes before giving up. We couldn’t order room service as we couldn’t get through.
10,The hotel is at the end of the strip. Everything inside the hotel is either closed or closes early so be prepared to drive everywhere and spending a fortune in doing so. A bottle of water costs $20 inside the hotel so you might want to bring you own water if you stay here.
40,Had a great time checking in and out should be easier parking should be closer. We live the pool but should be open longer . I wish it had a pool open til later at night. Over all is a great place to stay
50,"Mandalay Bay offers a large variety of restaurants table games slot machines and an exciting environment. The casino floor is spread out and you don't feel like you have someone sitting on you while playing the slot machines. ""The ceilings are so high that there is no lingering cigarette smoke."
50,We stayed 4 nights the room was nice view was great all very clean The staff was very friendly we ate in the Border Grill and the Sea Breeze restaurant and Ri Ra Irish Pub - all good experiences. We'll definitely stay again!
20,The rooms are so outdated and it doesn’t look like anyone actually cleans them before you check in. My bathtub was semi filled and there was mold all over the shower. The beds were lumpy and there were weird brown spots all over the ceiling. I have stayed in better motels.
30,Sunny at check out n was terrible. I was told prior to arrival to ask for an upgrade as an Explorerist in the Hyatt family. Over the phone I was told there was plenty of availability. Upon arrival I asked and sunny said no. I asked if there was anything available and she responded “do you want me to take someone out of their room to upgrade you?!” Then she conveniently did not verify my business Amex for payment so at check out I had to pay with my personal Amex. And then to find out my peer was offered an upgrade to the 4 seasons for only $30! Ridiculous!!
50,We arrived at 630pm on Friday a young lady assisted us with the app check in which helped us avoid the long check in line. We caught dinner at one of the many on site. Saturday we enjoyed an incredible day at the pool from 900am-6pm. Game day was incredible. I have been to many NFL stadiums. From the walk on Hacienda drive to the game and throughout the whole experience at Allegiant Stadium we and a wonderful weekend. So much to do without leaving the hotel until game time and after.
50,We always pick Mandalay when coming to Vegas. It is a little out of the way as it’s the first on the strip but that helps cut down crowds and noise. Casino is always clean and fun. Rooms are big with comfy beds. Also now there are so many dining options within the resort it makes it a great place to stay. No need to venture out!    Only tip: Pool has a lazy River…bring your own tubes from Target/Walmart. They aren’t supplied for free so you have to either buy one there for $25-$28 or rent a cabana to get any.
50,Someone found my husbands card that was accidentally left behind and used his express comps for over $500. Mandalay Bay took care of this and reissued a card and the Mlife Supervisor Stephanie took care of restoring the account. Great customer service!
50,Beautiful resort. Fantastic clean penthouse suite with unobstructed views of the strip. We added the vip arrival experience it was nice luxury transportation to from hotel private lounge check in that offers exceptional service top notch staff beverages but it was pricey at $250 plus $38 tax. We were expecting lounge to also offer snacksh’orderves likethe palazzo prestige lounge. Expensive for what you get but it was nice. Mandalay Bay has great access to the other strip resorts. Also the dining choices fit all budgets from food court to fine dining. Great variety. Pool area is tropical and worth checking out. We will stay at Mandalay Bay again.
50,We have been returning to Mandalay Bay for several years now after hopping MGM properties for years. The rooms are beautifully appointed and roomy not to mention always clean. The pool area is the best. See Bernice by the pool to rent chairs. she will take great care of you. Good food options. always treated first class
10,Our room was non functioning. Toilet seat couldn’t sit up right bathroom was gross (showers and bathtub) room service skipped our room not any quick food options downstairs (food courts). For the price we paid we got a worse room than our friends did for a fraction of the cost. The worst part was the fact that when room service finally arrived they moved a Fiji water bottle and it was a quarter empty. We know for a fact it happened when we were gone and did NOT want to be charged for it. Luckily we weren’t (as of yet) but kind of a ridiculous serious of unfortunate events. Was not happy with the stay especially when we previously stayed at Paris for half the price we paid in total here at mandalay and way more of a better experience at Paris.
10,The staff was terrible. Check in was a mess. Was told that we couldn’t do mobile checkin because we booked through Expedia and the staff could not “find” the reservation. When the keys stopped working for no reason had to again wait in the 1 hour checkin line. No one would help - said only the desk clerks at check in could help. Gave us bad directions multiple time TO PLACES IN THE ACTUAL HOTEL. Terrible service. The only positive was the room was clean.
20,The hotel itself is beautiful and this used to be our preferred Vegas hotel ten years ago. I came back for a conference this week and I have such mixed emotions. They exploit every possible opportunity to nickel and dime you. Examples:  - You pay a resort fee but you have to PAY for everything. The gym is the size of a valet closet packed to the gills with people and cheap old equipment. Apparently there's a fancy gym on the property - after several attempts I could not find it - that you pay a fee to workout in. Compare this to the Wynn that also charges a resort fee and you workout in a state of the art facility included in the resort fee.  - I rented a 2-bedroom suite to entertain my team. There was not a single empty refrigerator for us to chill drinks. Only fridge was full of minis and a note hanging said we'd be charged $50/day if we put other items in there. RIDICULOUS. Front desk advised we fill up ice buckets to chill drinks. I'm speechless here.  - The pool is great BUT if you'd like shade from the blazing Nevada sun then you must PAY. Chairs with umbrellas cost $225 for the day - thats 2 chairs and 1 umbrella. I paid the fee and ALL DAY LONG people walked up to sit in the nice chairs with umbrellas and were ushered away. People had the most negative sentiment - they were embarrassed and it's insane to charge a resort fee and not include shade.    I will NOT BE RETURNING. We stay at the Wynn or Encore where everything is classy.
30,Beds were comfortable rooms nice. Pools nice but hard to find a chair. You are charged $50 for simply touching wet/coffee bar in rooms. Restaurant by the pool was terrible like all the food is microwaved.
50,Wonderful hotel to spend your vacation or business trip! The choice of restaurants are terrific. The pools and beach area are very clean and the service is fantastic. I would recommend this to others.
50,Perfect place to stay every year we book this hotel Mandalay Bay and Delano. Now with the the new Raider stadium easy Walk. Love the wave pool easy parking casino is always clean and the sporbook is really big.
50,The room was incredible all staff was friendly and there were great options for food and drinks. During a time where other resorts had limited options and even more limited staff Mandalay Bay was fully open with ample friendly staff.
50,I am an employee there and since I do attend to the rooms daily I walked around and found the best possible room for my children to see a great review which it gave everything we asked for which was the Allegiant Stadium View the view of the beach for two of my children and the view of the airstrip for my other child
50,I usually stay at the other end of the strip but had tickets to the Raiders game so thought this would be better for going to the game. First off got a great room with a comp. View of the stadium which was great for us. We usually don't like strip views because it mean loud noises late at night. Huge room double sinks in the bathroom 2 closets super clean... There are a few things you should know. its mentions in reviews but worth a repeat.    1. The coffee in the room is not free. It doesn't say that but it is not free. I knew this so I brought my Kcup and also portable cups to drink it in. There are no cups to put your coffee in if you bring it.    2. DONT touch or open the fridge. I brought a few gallon zip lock backs and at night just filled one up with ice and put our waters orange juice in the bucket at night. We are not huge breakfast people so coffee and OJ is all we need in the morning. Saves time standing in lines.    3. Late night eats. After arriving at 9:30 pm.. We just wanted a light bite to eat. I knew room service would take awhile so we walked and walked and walked and walked to find the food court. Its by the convention center. Only thing opened was a subway. There are several other restaurants in the food court but I guess they close around 8:00pm. so plan ahead. Probably would have grabbed dinner at the airport or something to go from the airport instead.    4. If you have a pearl card you can avoid the pool line. I didn't know this and stood in like for about maybe 10 mins when was about 10 people before the entry I saw the line which was empty for pearl card holders.    5. Checking your bag especially before a Raiders home game. Awful! Terrible. Basically there was 1 guy checking in about 40 people in line. 3 other workers standing at the desk not helping him at all. Very strange.... there are only 8 raiders homes games... you know your guest will be storing luggage for the game.. why not staff correctly. It took 25 mins to store our bags. There was some issue with 1 group and our 1 guy was gone for like 5 minutes. Again... not sure why 2 people were standing at the desk just chatting it up while this one guy was busting himself to help people. Not a manager in sight to take over while the line just grew and grew and grew.    6. Using the downstairs electronic scan to get luggage.... DONT DO THIS!!! they will ask you if you are taking ride share.. which we did... then they will tell you they will store your luggage downstairs all you need to do is scan your ticket. SO... we did that... left the game a bit early as we knew it would be an issue... Scanned the ticket with no one in front of us and no one waiting downstairs. we waited and waited and waited while we saw many couple come from upstairs with bell tags luggage they just got from upstairs. I ran up stairs as we had flight and after waiting for 20 so minutes for our luggage he said oh your in the system it will only take aobut 5 more minutes. in the meantime about 8 sets of people with luggage from upstairs had come down. Just check your bag in at the bell desk!!!    All of that being said.. I really liked this hotel.. Some of thing I mentions were not complaints just to plan ahead so you know! Really the only situation I found frustating was the bell desk 2 times.    Pool was great lots of chairs in the morning. Quite building other than the neighbors and giggly girls walking around the halls at night. The usual Vegas noise.    Beds were comfortable. Lots of towels didn't need housekeeping. Great views. Staff was nice.    It only took about 10 mins once outside to walk to the game.
50,We were in town for a convention at the end of September and had a great time at Mandalay Bay. The resort offers a lot of gambling options restaurants nice pool and bars/clubs. The staff was friendly and helpful.
20,The hotel has a nice look but the staff lacks personality and warmth. The room was average but clean. I also could not reach staff in under 5 minutes per day. The housekeeping department was very slow to respond to my request. I traveled during the week. I would of been waiting forever if I need service over the weekend. Also watch the hidden fees.
10,Our stay was AWFUL! DO NOT waste your money! They nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING! $50 just to store YOUR OWN items in the fridge in your room. $30 to buy a raft to go in the lazy River...this should be included. Everything was overpriced to an extreme! $20 for a bottle of Fiji water in the room! Such bull!
30,Rooms don't have mini fridges or microwaves. The ones that have a fridge are for the minibar only and will charge you automatically based on weight changes - nothing in or out or you will be charged. Pool closes at 6pm on weeknights. I've been to basic hotels with fridges & microwaves in the every room and with pools/hot tubs that stay open every night until 10pm. For the price one pays at Mandalay Bay - this is unsatisfactory. Lame.
40,Rooms were nice. Charging extra to use the fridge was kind of lame though my only complaint. Plenty to restaurants to choose from without even leaving the property. Location is excellent if you're going to the stadium.
30,I had a comp room for two nights and was told that the only thing I would need to pay was the resort fee. When I checked in I was charged 200 for incidentals for TWO NIGHTS (checked in online and was not warned of this) and then was charged 88 for the resort fee after checkout. Needless to say my Vegas trip was very poor since I was 200 dollars short of what I planned. I could have dealt with $50 for incidentals but 200?! The room wasn't even that nice. They were comp rooms for crying out loud. Also $16 for a mini shot from the fridge?! C'mon now
50,Everything and everyone was great. Felt Covid safe and folks weren’t on top of one another. There are plenty of areas to go for privacy and pull off your mask eat a meal and feel safe. The pool/beach area was great!
20,Here on a conference I never left the casino. That being said I was only greeted by one employee during my entire three days here. I am not a high roller (not a roller at all); however I would have expected great service from a large facility like this.
20,I gave comments and feedback on the several areas where i felt there was a lack of service and general room care. I would not recommend this hotel to any person i associate with. This was a company function where we had a convention there  and I could not believe the feedback on the lack of service for the room.. especially having to pay for coffee!
20,For me this visit the only saving grace was the pool. II reserved a king room for a romantic weekend get away and was given a 2 Queen bed. I appreciate the fact that the resort fee was credited however the only explanation that I was given was the property oversold.. Lately I do not get to go to Vegas as much as I would have liked which is why I booked this trip so far out in advance to ensure that I could get the room that I wanted. And additionally it was frustrating to have the people in The room Next to us arguingFrom 7:00 a.m. till up about 9:00 a.m. very loudly.I attempted to go to one of your venues the foundation room and was asked to step outside of the line and wait for 2 to 3 minutes before I would be allowed in to the establishment. Upon me asking why I was told I just needed to wait a few minutes and then I would be allowed in. The rest of my party went in and as soon as they did I was informed that I would not be let in and no one would give me a reason why.I could understand if I was intoxicated however I was not. This trip to Mandalay Bay may have ruinedMy taste for M life properties.
50,Although I didn't want to stay on or to close to the strip the hotel was in a perfect location even being across the street from the airport. The facility was very impressive clean and the staff was exceptional nice.
40,The overall stay was very nice. The casino was clean and the servers were always stoping by. It was a great place to stay and being close to the football stadium was nice. The sports betting place was great and I enjoyed it greatly.
10,Elevators key system is a disaster. Staff was very rude when needing help with key system. Was forced to wait behind people checking in just to get key replaced. You will wind up getting stuck on elevator since it doesn’t read your key half the time
50,Check in was quick and pleasant. The woman at the front desk was nice and tried to accommodate my request for a good room with a view. The rooms are nice. Had an awesome experience! Will definitely be coming back.
10,No housekeeping help!! Dirty rooms. Very unfriendly hateful check in people. Ask for room close to elevator due to health problems they mad it almost as far as possible. Housekeeping only makes beds they are very unhelpful if you ask they do not help or even respond.
50,Great location on the Las Vegas strip in the middle of everything. The resort itself was beautiful and welcoming. Room was spacious and clean. The casino and lobby were crowded but we still had a great experience.
30,I’ve been to this hotel/resort many times and had many experiences. My visit started off great until I was given a room on the seventh floor. My room had a view of metal crisscrossing bars with bird droppings in between.
50,Excellent food shopping and best of all rooms for all Raider home games. Got great price on the room with a package ticket deal. Front desk was well staff and handled a large influx of patrons promptly. Answered any and all questions while making need adjustments to my friends and I reservation.
40,I really liked the size of the rooms along with the bed and bedding used in the room. The beach area was nice and clean service was good. But If your looking to eat at any restaurant in the hotel book it before you arrive.
50,it’s such a fun laid back escape of a resort. We always spend so much time in the pool and enjoy how much there is to offer at the resort. You’ll l the cleanness of the resort the staff are patient and understanding and seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs.
10,The room was filthy. Light burned out in the toilet area. Floor in bathroom filthy amd tub full of hair. When I finally got some one to listen I was told they would comp the $40 resort fee and mini bar items that I never touched. All in all the worst experience
40,This hotel is overlooked on the strip. It has a great pool and lazy river. The staff is friendly and I love almost all of the MLife property’s. Great variety of slots ! Lots of conventions are held here so pick the right time to avoid those.
50,This is the 3rd time at Mandalay Bay. We have been to Las Vegas over 40 times a many of the resorts mostly for conventions. I found Mandalay Bay a great property. The room was very clean and kept clean probably updated within the last few years. We were on the 12th floor. Pool was great there were a few shady places but most were in the sun. You don't go to the beach to sit in the shade.  All was not perfect but little is. Ice machine worked and then it didn't. Just wen to a floor below in the stairs and took the elevator back up. Digital key does not work well in the elevator as reported but it was easy to get a regular key.  Air conditioning worked well during our stay.
20,The room that we booked 2 months in advance was a king sweet when we arrived the room was not available. This was a very important weekend to me because I was planning on proposing to my girlfriend that weekend. We were not even compensated for the downgraded room. Other then that we did have a really good time spent a few thousand in the casino. That was the only bad experience on the trip
30,Mandalay Bay is supposed to be an upper level hotel with superior service and ammenitites and it just didn't seem to be up to par with other similarly priced hotels on the strip. The biggest disappointment started at check in when they didn't have the king bed that we had booked and then had to argue to get a mini fridge.
40,I was not impressed when told that the pool closed at 6 PM every night. Our room had a view and a jet tub but other than that nothing outstanding to make it worth the price. The exterior and interior are well kept and the wave pool was fantastic.
30,This hotel was recommended by a friend because of the pool area and casino. Those were the best parts of the hotel. Restaurants were ok rooms were ok service was mediocre at best. Upon going into some of the other hotels on the strip would stay at one on the north end next time.
20,$400 dinner you cannot take leftovers back to room or get charged $50 for storing in refrigerator- unreal. Paid $400 for daybed at pool and the worst food on the strip is served IN A PLASTIC BAG like Doordash- 5 star prices with 1 star service. Going elsewhere in the future.
20,Very disappointing.  I advise anyone that stays in any of these MGM hotels to check their mini bar and take photos right when you check in if anything is missing because they will charge you and it’s a very expensive charge for anything that is missing from the previous guests or from employees stealing things.
10,We stayed here in July. Our room looked out on to a big air conditioning unit windows were filthy dirty and there was a dead bird laying out there on the ground for the length of our stay. I reported it to the manger on day 3 but they did not come and remove the bird .
50,I always love staying at this hotel. I started by trip for business and extended for leisure. There were minor plumbing issues that were easily resolved. The hotel room was clean aesthetically pleasing and the beds were comfortable.
50,Was traveling with friends to Las Vegas Raider game hotel was walking distant from stadium .Staff is very pleasant and very consistent always say hello and will lend a helping hand. I always stay at the Mandalay bay
40,This resort is gorgeous and the staff are very attentive and kind. That being said for the cost to book a room here every little thing in the hotel room is an upcharge including $50 to use the refrigerator. Morning coffee? $12. Bottled water? $20. Its excessive in my opinion.
50,Great customer service incredible pool area fantastic restaurants fabulous casino and sports/race book. Great for families and singles alike. I will come back to the Mandalay Bay whenever i'm in Las Vegas.
50,The Mandalay Bay is a great time. The shark reef was a convenient daytime activity. The only downside is the location being so far from the idk of the strip. The pools are massive with a family friendly part in addition to an adult part
50,This is the perfect hotel for going to a Raider game or any other event at Allegiant Stadium. The game was a 5-minute walk from the hotel over a overpass that was blocked to car traffic. Beautiful rooms clean facilities friendly and helpful staff and a variety of restaurants some of which have the best food in all of Vegas.(Stripsteak anyone?)
20,I normally don’t stay at a resort this pricey and was very excited to. The drinks were more expensive than the airport (how is that possible?) food at pool bar and grille wasn’t edible. Room was dirty.
40,Staff was very friendly and check in was easy (not crowded at the time). My only complaint was quality of towels and TP. Both are pretty thin. Check out Skyfall at the Delano. Also there's a simple breakfast place right across the strip if you get tired of paying $25 for an egg.
10,We had no hot water in our room  The room was extremely dirty to include poop on our bedding.  Our party had a hearing disability and were told it’s not their problem we can’t hear.we called to speak to a manger and said they can give us the resort fee and even admitted to the “spare change “ compared to the price of the $500 a night room
10,This was a return trip for my family--we had previously stayed at the Mandalay Bay and had an awful experience. In response the hotel provided us with a complimenary stay which we used for this trip. I have been coming to this hotel since it opened and I will say that our last 2 trips have proven to me that it has gone significantly downhill. This is definitely not a resort for families. After this past stay I do not think that I will return which is disappointing.
10,MGM has created a monopoly of the strip and now overcharges for everything. No value and treated like a number. Watch out for the faulty minibar in the room. They like to charge in room $12 coffee you never used.
50,I had a great time. My brother and I went to see the UFC fight and we stayed at the Mandalay Bay we had a great time the staff was friendly very informative and very helpful. I am a nursing moms so I had to take my pump with me and was able to get a mini fridge in our room complementary store for milk I would pop over the weekend
20,Overpriced for what we got. In room coffee 2 cups $12. Bar prices are very high. Parking is a long long way away. Staff was nice but you need to check your bill as things get added that you didn't get. Rooms was clean
50,The place was great I really did not have any issues. The rooms were big and clean. The bed was comfy and nice. I really liked the pool area there was a very fun wave pool and a lazy river and the water was very healthy and clean.
20,Really the minimum table price is $25.00. Most were empty. One bad run or bad dice you loose everything.  The slot machines were tight it seam like we never won anything just constantly take a $100 here and a $100 there. At least let some wins come now and then or give people a chance at a table by lowering the minimums.
40,Had to travel to Oceans Casino to play poker - disappointing that MB is not able to attract the Poker Players .check the bathroom floor tile in 30 320 as there is a liquid stain that looks like the marble coloring but it isn't.
50,Wonderful pool experience a couples getaway destination and very fun. I would recommend this property for a getaway. I would also Like to stay here again in the near future. Honestly expected it to be a lot more uptight but it was a relaxing environment.
50,We came in for a week and had our adult kids for 4 nights  Really good time from check in to check out  We had a van and parking was easy and free  Love the Hot Tub in the morning before the crowd shows up  Mixed on some COVID stuff not by staff but by some guests like dropping masks or no social distance  All in all a great trip
50,Nothing but good except an elevator glitch during busy time. I went up and down 5 times w out the doors opening but when they did I just changed cars and all was well. The readers for key cards could use some updating
50,Fantastic pool & beach casino dining and accommodations... plus it' super close to the airport. Friendly staff and massive gaming area (with a great sports book). The Spa is also a must if massage is your thing. If you don't feel like walking the strip Mandalay Bay has everything you need under one roof.
10,"I have been staying at the Mandalay Bay for years however our last visit was absolutely stained by the restaurant management at the Citizen's restaurant. Patrick the manager told us that regardless of the restaurant listing that it was open until 1am and with people in the restaurant in line we were being turned away 15 minutes before close even though we politely offered to take the food to go and that it was up to his discretion on whether he wanted to allow us in. His exact response was ""It's up to me whether I let you in you can complain to Mandalay Bay if you want"". Extremely poor management especially for a manager at a restaurant in a Vegas hotel that should be the epitome of hospitality."
50,Excellent meeting and getaway for us. The staff property location cleanliness service were all great. all the restaurants and stores were all covid prepared and we had no issues at any time while we were there.
50,Although I have stayed at almost all MGM properties in Las Vegas I have to say Mandalay Bay was definitely one of the best. Room was beautiful clean and nicely decorated with great view of the strip. Property is Hugh but easy to navigate. Pools are awesome- one of the only times I used my gambling time to enjoy their acres of pools. Loved the wave Pool and the lazy river but also enjoyed just relaxing at regular pool. Many of Pool chairs at the Pool- just have to decide where you want to relax. Pool servers are very attentive if you need something to drink or eat. Wish I could have won more would love to repeat this stay. If you haven’t try mobile application for reservations or check in I highly recommend. You enter your confirmation number of guests arrival time if known any add insult such as parking early arrival and payment method. They email you when room is ready and your electronic key. It is wonderful!
50,Exceptional service at Mandalay Bay. Every staff I came across was friendly and helpful. Love the easy accessibility to McDonalds and the convenience of the Shops at Mandalay Bay. The Tram to Luxor and Excalibur was a plus.
50,The resort was beautiful clean and friendly. Most of the restaurants are vegan friendly. The aquarium was beautiful and I even touched a stingray!!! The wave pool is huge and had a lot of fun there. I loved my room. The tub was huge and the shower was outstanding.
30,The casino is gorgeous. My room was spacious and sleep came easy in the amazingly comfy bed. However bathroom space was dirty. The toilet was dirty and/or stained and within a separate space with it's own door. That space smelled of old urine.    Customer service was a lot to be desired. Front desk personnel wasn't rude but they weren't inviting either. Housekeeping didn't replace towels or the floor mat two of the three nights I was there.
20,We booked a king room and was informed that there were no king rooms available and couldn't accommodate what we booked. We were commped 75.00 food and drink credit but that does not cover the cost of the difference we booked or relieve the frustration when we arrived.
50,Beautiful hotel! The staff were excellent. Marichris R. Is the best wedding planner ever. The venue is beautiful and the ceremony was everything. Everyone was amazing. Hotel was beautiful and clean. We will continue to stay on our annual trip.
30,The walls are to thin and you could hear your neighbors. Especially in the morning when you are trying to sleep in. The wall need to be sound proof. The shower head was very low in pressure. Other than that it was just ok
50,Great stay the property was in a great location and had exceptional service. Traveled alone but would come stay fir business or family related. The rooms were great and the restaurants amazing. Definitely a rebook soon.
10,Was here on business. A colleague was robbed in the conference area. Took security 2 hours to arrive to the scene. They were fairly dismissive. The front desk man was also rude and dismissive. I really did not feel safe at the hotel for the rest of my stay. I was on edge.
20,Had absolutely no water pressure in either of our rooms.    Also no enforcement of masks. If you’re going to mandate it then enforce it. Some of us decided to come here because of the mandate but we were limited on what we could do because the majority of people wore them wrong or not at all.
10,My room had a broken sink that glugged anytime anyone below or above me used their sink broken and clogged shower that was fixed by a really nice engineer but was then filled with black gunk that wasn't cleaned until I called again the ice bucket was filled with someone else's water the TV did not work and there was so much visible dust flying around that it made me sick. It took me about 9 hours to get people to help me with my issues in room. The people who helped were AMAZING and its not their fault that mlife understaffed their hotels to save money.. I am local and pretty much come to thr strip to lie down shower and watch TV and unwind because I work from home. I couldn't do any of those things and left early.    Last time I went i had a larger room and experienced the same issues. the room service is also so overpriced its like 40 bucks for 3 chicken strips. Go to the cosmo for the same price and get better rooms and cheaper better quality food. I am sick of mlife draining the enjoyment out of vacations because of their greed.
20,Yeah it’s Vegas so stuff isn’t cheap but to try to charge $22 for a bottle of Fiji or $12 for a k-cup is just pretty insulting. I got a comped 2 br suite. The room had broken door handles not enough towels no normal useful things (corkscrew) and was a crappy layout and dated. Won’t be staying here again.
50,The tub is everything! I used my bath bomb that I brought with me and it was amazing. The water pressure in the shower was great!! Room service was great as well. The service on Saturday is faster than the service on Sunday.
50,Lots to do without having to leave to property.pandemic responsible experience there were plenty of free mask stations and sanitizers around the casino and in the stores if you happen to lose or forget your mask.
50,My stay was wonderful everything was great one problem we didn’t receive room service but besides that everything was great from the room to restaurants to going out I must say I had a blast I can’t wait to go back.
40,WiFi services were spotty which is troubling if your using mobile app and digital keys. Restaurants had good variety but tough to get reservations and waits were long. Sportsbook area was fun and good service
50,This is an excellent hotel casino to stay at. Everything is done on your cell phone with the MGM Resort Application. From check in to check out to using your phone as a room key to paying your bill there is nothing left to do. No long lines and the room I was given for an extremely low weekend price was outstanding. Very large room overlooking the pool 2 large individual closets extremely large bathroom with 2 sinks huge tub large shower and separate room with the toilet. I have stayed in many different hotel casinos in Las Vegas for much higher prices and much smaller rooms with no view. At the Mandalay Bay I thought I had died and gone to Heaven. I also dined at LUPO by Wolfgang Puck and the RI RA IRISH PUB. Both restaurants were outstanding in service quality and ambience. You can't go wrong staying at the Mandalay Bay. The only thing I miss is the restaurant RED SQUARE is no more.
10,We paid $1700 for 2 rooms and they would not let us enjoy them. Assaulted my man and brother and kicked us out. Then over charged me for things we didn’t use and $170 for a cleaning fee (after not even letting me go upstairs to get my things)!! We were in 1500 suites and dresses but treated like trash. I’m sure if we were of another race they wouldn’t have dared done that! And I want my 2 pair of gold earrings I left in that bedroom in the couch you thieves. F you guys seriously
10,Issues with our room were never addressed. No hot water for 4 out of 5 days. Towels not being replaced. Some lights not working. Told front desk multiple times nothing was done. We asked if we could get a few coffee cups on the second night there the last at the front desk said she would send someone right up. 3 hours later and still nothing.
50,We booked rooms here because we had tickets to a football game at Allegient Stadium. Easy walking distance to the game (they closed the bridge over the interstate to traffic!) and we love the sports book. The rooms were immaculate and the staff was friendly at every turn.
40,We were visiting for three days with my family room was nice casino was nice staff was nice and restaurants were very good and was nice overall we appreciate you guys thank you and see you in the next visit
10,Very disappointing stay overall. Dirty room with a broken toilet seat.  My toilet never got fixed even after reporting this problem to the front office. Literally every corner of all the rooms are covered with dirt and debris. You can tell that the standard for cleanness is not very high for this hotel. No free bottle water and coffee completely baffled me. This is a classic case of greed gone wild.  This hotel has been going downhill sometime..    Sounds more like Motel 6.
50,Since the check in Sun was very nice and very helpful. The room was amazing and super clean and the view was just breathtaking. Super easy check out as well. Everything was just great. Had an amazing time there. Thank you
20,The best part of the room was the view which comes at a premium cost. You are not allowed to change your mind at check in if you don't want to pay for the view room. Surprised we had two towels in the room.
50,Nice rooms and great quality service along with relaxing environment. Staff was polite and courteous as well as helpful with any questions and concerns that I had. Room accommodations were very well kept.
40,Loved how spacious the room was. Bed was comfy. Mask and sanitizer was provided in a reusable zipper bag. Would definitely recommend to others. I did not see anyone around to assist me. But besides all of that I would definitely stay there again.
50,This is our fave place to stay in Vegas and definitely  has the best pools. We love Moorea and always meet great people there. The restaurants are fantastic. We ate at Lupos this trip and honestly it was one of the best dinners we've had anywhere.
50,Beat the Vegas heat with their great pools! Border grill is a great restaurant on the premises. Hector is an incredible server and bartender that made our visit memorable. It was so exceptional that we will return to visit in the future. The food was superb and the drinks were delicious and unique.
40,Great stay it is at the end of the strip so it seemed like a task to go to the strip but there’s so many amenities at the hotel we didn’t even mind that we barely saw the strip. Although there isn’t much for the kids the pool area helped a lot!
50,Property was Beautiful The room not so. First night we noticed no wash cloths in room. Next day no wash cloths again. Floor in bathroom dirty not swept. Next day same but some towels weren’t replaced. Again floor was dirty in bathroom. Poor house cleaning for our room. Also if the items in the fridge are priced so high and nobody buys them. How long do they stay in the fridge before they are replaced? Bad sales pitch! I would price the sodas and drinks a little more affordable and have a better turn around. Or just take out the product in the rooms and keep pop machines along with candy or sandwiches in the lobby. I’m just 1 person who would hope someone is listening. Marketing is key to keeping your rating up to a 5 star. Thank You for your time! Looking forward to staying again with better results.
10,gal at check in did not smile or welcome! just give me this and that and here's your room#! failed to tell me way to the elevator. i told her i'd self parked and said nothing! called for some bottle of waters after paying nearly $40+ per day in resort fee this was not an MGM Resort hotel like! felt like tropicana or Imperial Palace! only thing you did not charge me for is breath of air! surprised that oxygen is free! paid for parking and what good is resort fee for? we are still in a pandemic!
30,I was very disappointed the the room conditions and hopped that I would not have to write this review. But Mandalay Bay is at a average rating. The hotel is friendly and helpful the food was great Citizens was just as I remembered and the House of blues was excellent.
20,This hotel is quite an expensive. A low price initially then everything is an add on including a cup of coffee in the room. Don't touch the mini bar! You have to buy everything in it. Really? I'll never go there again or recommend it to anyone.
50,My friends and I had such an amazing time at the Bay. The room was exceptional and the pool was great. When I arrived I requested my room be changed to a higher room and there was no problem accommodating me. I can't wait to stay again when I visit Las Vegas
50,Had great time. Hotel has alot to offer. Beautiful pool and spa. Plenty of restaurants to choose from and close to all transportation needs for access to all of that vegas has to offer. Beautiful mountain views short walk to raiders stadium.
50,Accommodation was excellent. The room was clean and smelled fresh. The in-room dining staff was friendly and pleasant. Great experience. I would stay at this hotel again the price was reasonable. Great!!
30,A phrase I had while frequenting this hotel was “it’s good but…” because it is a good hotel but there are things that detract from it.  The room I got was a good room in general nice size comfortable bed & nice bathroom but the concerts in the pool area prevented me from sleeping in or enjoying naps throughout the day  The staff was great at the front desk & the pool area itself is amazing but the staff is not amazing at the pools & beach club.  The property itself is great to walk around but it’s location isn’t good. Furthest on the strip but not near the monorail tram isn’t easy to find & with it being the last hotel on the strip you have to cross the street to take advantage of the deuce or monorail to go up the strip.  Food offerings are ok but if you want food court options you’ll need to walk to the luxor and excalibur.    Based on cost and location it’s hard to justify the stay but maybe I just got a bad experience.
10,Went on a work trip here and was very disappointed in the experience. Service was poor had issues with wifi and with my room lighting and the front desk brushed me off and would not even accomodate a room swap for the same room.
40,Mandalay bay provided a great experience for all of the Iowa State fans that traveled to see Iowa State take on UNLV at the new stadium. The location was great and everything was very easy to walk to and get around.
40,I generally have enjoyed my previous stays at Mandalay Bay but this time was not up to par. I arrived around midnight and wanted something to eat. Not only were the restaurants closed but the bars were not serving food. What made matters worse is that Mandalay Bay is at the end of the Strip so walking outside to a nearby place is not an option. The next day I rented a cabana. The food was very very poor and one of the drinks was served with a bee in the cup! Not what I have come to expect from Mandalay Bay.
30,Property looks tired especially hallways and rooms. Casino floor smells like smoke. No hand towels in my room. Nickel and dime - who charges to use the in-room coffee maker. Issues with room keys working in the elevators - 50% success rate
40,My husband was travelling there for a business conference which coincided with our 25th anniversary so we combined it as a couples trip. We added an extra night at the beginning of our stay. But we couldn’t add it to our existing reservation so we had to check-in to a different room for the 1st night. We planned on checking out at 11am to wait until 3pm for our next room check-in. The front desk allowed us to have an extended check-out time / early check-in time accommodation which was a nice touch! Also the restaurants who were informed it was our anniversary made extra special care to celebrate with us by providing us champagne!    It was a great hotel but the outdoor pool area is starting to show signs of age. Some of the walls were cracking the cabanas and patio furniture are looking worn. The interior of the hotel itself still looks great. The rooms were beautiful. We had an issue of low water pressure one night and called guest services who told it us it was a hotel wide issue. My husband couldn't take a shower because there was literally a drip coming out of the shower. He ended up bathing in the tub. It resolved by the next day.    In the meanwhile the ice dispenser which was located adjacent to our room was leaking and seeped into our room so our carpet was wet. They placed some fans to help it dry in the hallway but not in our room.    The workout and spa amenities still looked good although we noticed part of the ceiling near the workout room glass window was in repair.    All-in-all you can tell it was a 5-star hotel at one point but the shine and brilliance is quickly fading.
40,"the hotel is fine. Good value. rooms are great. Stuff are great. The only problem we have is the ""beach"" which on purpose they have no shade so we have to buy some sort of shading and they can charge you arm and a leg for that. Not nice !!!"
20,"There was a $12 charge for coffee in the room. And big charges for bottled water in the room.  With ""resort"" fees can they make it complementary.  Corridor carpets need cleaning.  Room windows were dirty."
30,Most Vegas resorts have rooms that wow me. the Mandalay is decent but nothing out of the ordinary. I would probably stay again but purely for the proximity to a conference. Also the casino is not that exciting compared to others on the Strip.
50,Great Casino and beautiful place to stay. Fun night life and fun or relaxing pools your choice!  Our bed was so comfortable! I want the same mattress for my home. There are allot of food choices at Mandalay Bay and you won't be disappointed.
50,Pleasant staff and quick response time was exceptional. Room was clean and all the items I left in the room were intact when I returned. Huge facility and well organized. Received free parking pass to be able to movie my car back and forth. Thank you
10,It was bad from check in. They didn't notify me of my room being ready. When it was the A/C didn't work. They didn't fix the A/C after three hours so they switched me rooms. I had to go downstairs to get the key (after I repacked.) There weren't towels in either room.
20,My stay at Mandalay Bay was well below what I expected. Our room and shower were dirty at checkin the casino felt small and not every lively also the food court was a long walk away and the selections were limited. It also found it strange that they had huge pool complex that closed at 6. I would not stay here again even if offered a free room.
10,If they could charge you for air they would find a way. Very disappointed. Room was very noisy. I could hear everything going on in the next room. They might as well have been in my room holding a business meeting. The bed was very old and lumpy. No water or coffee provided. $12.00 to make your own coffee. Very shameful. I will not come back to this hotel again to stay.
30,My stay was fine the room service was great and my bed was cleaned every day. We used the pool a couple of times make sure you buy or bring your own floatie!! The floatie prices are quite high. Of course there's gonna be scents of smoke in the hotel but hey that's just vegas! The only thing I did not like was the casino staff at the cashiers they look like they hate their jobs and then take it out on you. The withdrawal fee for cash with them is 8 dollars!! More expensive than the atms there.. they got mad because we no longer wanted to pull money out with them...what??
40,Rooms are old.The stuff is great though!  Hotel rooms need an upgrade.  So many hotels upgraded their rooms during the Covid closure. This one didn't. Expect old stuff. Showers could not bring enough water to 13th floor. Cant imagine how was at higher floors.
50,The hotel was just as good as we remembered when we came before Covid.  A couple things to take note of and not the hotels fault were the lack of towels in the rooms. Evidently all towels are sent out to be cleaned and they do not get back half of what is processed. Also a bit of a shortage of staff but they handled it well.  Slot machines are spaced out everyone is wearing a mask. I am not sure the rooms are as clean as they should be but again shortage of staff they are friendly and doing the best they can. Food ordered via room service or at the pool is delivered in a compostable box again because of Covid.    Giselle ( Cabana Lead) is fantastic she made sure we had a great time and were taken care of at the pool.    Marianna at the front desk check in was the best we have ever had in efficiency. Very very impressed quickly got our rooms on the same floor same hall way and we were able to check in early when we arrived at 1 pm.
50,My first time traveling since the pandemic. First time staying at this hotel. So glad I got to stay here because I’ve heard amazing things about their pool (and it did not disappoint). I’ve always wanted to experience Vegas pools and I’m so glad my first experience was at Mandalay Bay! The wave pool id so much fun and the drinks were amazing. Definitely reserve lounge chairs….. they have umbrellas lol! And they give you water! Our stay was amazing; from check in to our rooms to the lovely cabana boys and our cocktail waitress to check out service was outstanding. Thanks Mandalay Bay I will be back!
50,Friendly staff great pool many eating choices..if your looking for luxury at a more reasonable price than some of the bigger resorts.. this is a great place! My only “complaint” is it is some distance from many other resorts and sights but tram is available..
50,I recently visited Las Vegas and was a little skeptical about going because of the COVID situation. Well I can say I stayed at the Mandalay Bay and I don’t regret it one bit. I received optimal service and felt secured and safe at all times. The service was incredible and the security was outstanding. I have a knee condition and when I approached a security officer for assistance with a wheel chair he was so diligent and I had the wheel chair in no time. I can say I will definitely be staying there again. If you want to have an outstanding vacation with great service and feel safe Mandalay Bay is the place to stay.
20,Do not stay here unless you are only going to sleep in your room. Needs lots of upgrades. Need more towels & things. Don’t offer to help with something is wrong. The room was very dusty like no one had been in there for weeks. Air conditioning is not reall air conditioner
40,The hotel is beautiful but it is at the end of the strip so it makes for a lot of walking. Warning to the LGBT community the security and management of the Daylight pool club kicked two guys out for dancing together.
10,Like that leftover casserole in your fridge this place has rotted slowly but surely from its former glory. Bad service outrageous prices poor restaurants. I’ve stayed here for years  but nevermore
10,I will never stay at this hotel again. With all the options this has been the worst experience I've had. There were issues with the charges and when I called to get it resolved I was told it's my banks problem and was hung up on
20,"When you stay at an MGM owned resort they try to get you by making you pay a ""resort fee"" when you arrive. Then when you want a beer they charge $16 for a tall boy that you can buy at the gas station right across the street for $3. Stay off the strip or downtown to avoid being a captive audience stuck paying crazy high drink and food prices"
20,When we got to our room we discovered it had not been cleaned. We were reassigned to a different room but the key did not work requiring us to go back to the front desk and wait again in the long check-in line to have it corrected. We were given a $75 credit for the inconvenience but the delay forced us to cancel a dinner reservation with friends. When we eventually got to a room the water pressure was so low it was difficult to take a shower. One day the cleaners removed the bar of soap and did not replace it. There was a $10 charge for making coffee in the room.
50,We love staying at the Mandalay Bay. Everyone is so friendly and the rooms are always great! Never super crowded. Easy to get a machine if you want to play slots. Needs to open more card tables but other than that everything is always great.
40,Only received large towels no washcloths or hand towels concert at pool on first night went till 2 am couldn't sleep because of the noise in the room we were told it should have been over by midnight.
50,First time at the Mandalay Bay Everything was very nice check on was smooth not a long wait Room was very nice it looked like the pictures when you booked There were many restaurants only thing I was late night it was only Subway and the market I will definitely book with you again  My
30,Mandalay Bay used to be the jewel of the strip with its magnificent pools and attention to cleanliness (clean smelling air and surfaces). It is aging and the service was terrible. The prices have not reduced and in many cases increased post pandemic very disappointed; would not recommend.
20,The pool was a major let down which was a huge part of our trip since we rented cabanas for two days. There was no music since the system was broken and they didn't seem to be in a rush to get it fixed. Who goes to Vegas for dead silence at the pool? We wanted fun music to liven things up. The entire pool seems very outdated as well as the rooms. This hotel used to be great but was such a letdown for the amount of money we spent there over the long weekend. I would suggest going to a newer hotel. We came for what we remember the pool being but so disappointing
50,Mandalay Bay provides all the essentials for a Vegas getaway. Fantastic restaurants great outdoor pool area with multiple options and easy walking access to the new football stadium. With indoor connections to the Luxor and Excalibur hotels to mix up the environment you will find the evenings entertainment you desire with ease. With reasonable room rates this is a fantastic stay.
50,Checking in was a breeze! Was able to check in the night before my arrival and was asked what time I expected to be in town. They didn’t promise to have my room ready especially bc I didn’t pay for early check in. But it was such a great surprise when I got notified before noon that our room was ready. Loved that I was able to use my phone as a key as well and it was so easy to print out a physical card as well. Clean room great pool amazing staff would come again.
20,We booked 2 rooms for myself & friends attending the raider game. I was able to get my room right away however their digital key crap does not work! Which was a total nightmare & we got stuck on the elevator. After getting real key cards we were able to finally get to our room but our friends were not as fortunate. They did not get their room until 9:15PM & the $100 resort credit that was offered was an absolute insult. Will not be coming back.
30,"Same old Mandalay with a layback attitude. Yeah Raiders' stadium is conveniently near and likely will become ""official"" tailgate location for fans. Yet the lack of appealing for savvy business travelers is making this less and less attractive to stay even so considering is that far away walking distance from fashion restaurants and clubs."
40,I have never met one Mandalay staff member that was not always 110% friendly and professional regardless of busy-ness. Only gripe is that room water pressure was barely a shower trickle every morning. Otherwise the room was modern check out was easy even the bell hops were friendly despite a long line of bag drops after check out.
50,Large clean room with 2 queen beds and shower/tub in the bathroom. Brought my own coffee K-Cups and coffee cups to avoid large cost to use their coffee - there is a Kerig in the room. Worked out each morning in the Cardio Center - very nice facility with free bottled water (took a few to the room to avoid room bottle water charge). Pool was nice but does get crowded - bring your own floatie for the lazy river. Went to Michael Jackson show - excellent! Great distance to walk to the stadium for the football game. Would stay here again.
10,The only benefit is that this hotel is very close to Allegiant stadium. Other than that… it has one of the highest resort fees and incidentals shower in the room was nice but there was mold growing around the bottom not a big selection for machines to play and they do not pay out well we had to request a do not disturb sign no information in rooms for ordering in or ease of knowing who to call where to call or what to do if you have issues or concerns air conditioner did not work well at all. Our room AC was set at 65 degrees and it stayed 74 in the room the whole time. No refrigerator in room no information on the safes in the room elevators are a joke! Only half worked but they all were in service. You just could not get your room card to work in them so we would be stuck at lobby level or stuck in them. They make you scan your room card to keep you only going to the floor your on however if you stay in the elevator you can get off at any floor someone else on the elevator is getting off on. Service for beverages at the casino is almost impossible. It took an hour to order and 40 minutes for the drink to come back and it was not right. I ordered one beer and a vodka cranberry. I received a beer and a jack and coke.    Went to the Luxor for breakfast buffet since we were limited on options and everything but the stadium is so far away and that also was horrible food quality. My fiancée said it use to be really good but it was so bad that he settled for 2 boxes of Frosted Flakes and I ate a salad. $29.99 plus tax for 3.8oz. Of Frosted Flakes and some milk and another 29.99 for me to make my own salad and have a cup of hot chocolate.  However Tim at Avis car rental was amazing! He really saved our only full day we had available on our vacation. I cannot thank him enough. Also do not ever rent a car from Hertz in the Cosmopolitan. We got there to get our car at 8:30a and they said cars were double booked and they did not have a car for us. It took us 4 hours to find a car finally I called the Avis desk in Mandalay Bay and time did everything he could to get us a car and he succeeded! It did cost us more than what our car at hertz was but it was also a bigger vehicle. Return of the car was a little harder. The key drop in the parking garage is out of order and the box at the desk was jammed. There is no one at the car rental desk after 5 on a week day and so even after calling the corporate office since the bell hop could not figure it out
10,Room was not ready as promised had to wait after 4 to check in. Was not notified when room was ready as promised. Didn't get to experience the pool because of this. Don't think I will be returning especially with no Buffet.
50,Resorts location was great & close to events we were going too especially close to the stadium!!Lots of things to do within the resort!! Rooms were clean & spacious!! Loved the casino & restaurants available!! Staff was super friendly & helpful!!
30,They charge you for self parking wifi ( which sucks)  and only half of the little quick fast food joints were open late. We had reservations at Lupo which was great. The pool was great but a bit overcrowded. Wish the room had been better for the price.
10,My trip was terrible my room was supposed to come with a king size bed i was stuck with 2 queen beds it was supposed to have a handicap accessible shower but didn't i was there 3 nights and housekeeping only came up once
40,Up on Travel to Las Vegas to watch my favorite Football team. The check in took a bit longer than I expected but it was good. Very polite and friendly. The Rooms were very clean and safe! I have to say it was a great stay! I would recommend it to anyone! Housekeeping was absolutely the BEST!!! Couldn't ask for more!
50,We love the lazy River! We bring our own tubes and air them up at the lazy River. Very convenient.  We also love RiRas restaurant. They have a live band that is awesome!  The pool was great. Has fun catching up with friends and seeing a football game.
30,The hotel itself is nice. There are four pools and a wave beach.    We did run into some issues though.  Not a dealbreaker but the guests checking in around us also didn’t get their expected rooms because they “weren’t ready yet” even though it was about 4:30 when we checked in.    We didn’t get any soap or other toiletries. Had to flag down a cleaning person for some bar soap because Mandalay doesn’t offer body soap.    The shower also doesn’t drain quickly leaving a pool of water in the shower.    Parking was far and a bit confusing to get to as they share a parking lot with Delano Luxor and the Four Seasons or something like that.    We also had an issue of hotel staff knocking repeatedly on our door to perform a “room check” even though we had a Do Not Disturb sign on the door. Thankfully I woke up as they were entering so I could let them know we were still in the room.
30,The pool was really nice and the restaurant we ate at was good and that was about it. We had a lot of problems with our rooms from a door half off the hinges to not handing any towels or glasses in the room. The air conditioner would make a loud horrible noise every time it came on. They told us our rooms were directly across from each other and they were actually down the hall from each other. They gave us $75 credit for the door issue but that didn’t make up for everything.
30,Our room was just so-so but the pool is amazing. I would recommend dining off property if you stay here as well. We stayed for 5 nights before a work conference and then during the work conference. There are better properties to stay at based on our most recent visit.
30,One of the self parking entrances was closed due to an event next door. One of the staff members was rude. There was no conditioner in the bathroom. It was one of my favorite hotel/casinos. Most of the restaurants were closed. The beds are very comfortable and the hotel managers was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean and beautiful.
40,Overall satisfied. Room could have been cleaned a little better upon arrival. Casino was not terribly busy. $20 Uber from the airport.. tram service partially down the strip. Great food choices inside the casino. Weird the pools close at 6pm
50,This hotel was beautiful nice bathrooms! Pool area was fun for the whole family. (Wish it was open a little longer). We also enjoyed the tram to their sister hotels. Plenty of food options. Slice of Pizza was yummy.
40,Sports book raider games what is not to like? Solid restaurants and nice rooms. Mandalay Bay is known for the pool but there is much more here than just a pool scene. The foundation room is awesome terrific service and views up there. Great atmosphere if you are into sports. Highly recommend this hotel and it is not really that far from the main strip
50,I love the customer service. Everyone was knowledgeable about fixing the issues or helping with reservations. There was never a long wait. The massage were amazing. Nice birthday trip. Thanks for the great hospitality.
50,Much need vacation. Mandalay bay meet all our needs for this much needed break from realty. From pools especially the wave pool. 3 pools and wave pool and lazy river. Rooms were spacious. At end of strip making it a little bit quieter then other hotels. You didnt have people using your hotel as a cut thru. You were just a short tram ride away from being right in the middle of everything.
40,While pricey the room was very modern clean and very comfortable. The staff was friendly everywhere in the hotel and helpful when trying to find things. There are 6 pools which is really fun but beware they will try to charge you for everything 6x what it should be. No drinks allowed - you must buy from them inside. You can bring in an inner tube for the lazy river but buy it on amazon - they charge $30 for 1 tube that costs $5 everywhere else. Just like every where else in Vegas they want to hang you upside down to shake out every last dime you might have. There is a refrigerator in the room BUT if you open it they charge you $50 a day. Its fully stocked with overpriced drinks and you are NOT allowed to use it for your own food or drinks. There are parking and resort fees too. The restaurants are expensive BUT the food is really really good at this resort. Citizens was my favorite as well Slices and the Mexican restaurant in The Shoppes of Mandalay Bay. I have stayed at other hotels on the strip (like Caesars) and Mandalay Bay is my favorite because of the pools and the convenient food courts shops and friendly staff. A lot of police presence on the property - friendly and made me feel very safe even when alone at night. Oh and the best is there is a Fat Tuesdays in the Shoppes of Mandalay Bay! Why did I give this rating of 4? I don't like hotels that nickel and dime me at every turn - let me use the refrigerator without a charge let me bring in my own water to the pool so I don't have to spend $10 on a $2 bottle of water.
50,Multiple choices of pools plus a wave pool and a lazy river. Clean room excellent customer service overall. Not a fan of being charged for parking as a guest $15/night. I love how they have a beach party/concert and you can dip in the water and/or dance your heart out!
30,My birthday trip was good. The couch in the room was stained. There were no wash rags in the bathroom. And the ice machine on the floor was broken. We ordered ice to be sent up to our room and it took over 2 hours.
10,Bring your own tubes for lazy river!! Scam! No refills on souvenir cups! Beware! Parking cost $$$! Fraud! Rooms and hallways dark!! Water pressure on showers terrible!! Crap! Service was no where to be found!!
50,Was a lot fun with the family we enjoy to the max it was to excite gamble time I love it so much hope we can do it again pretty soon and all ways recommend this place to my friends and family because is excellent
30,The room overall was nice but our toilet did not work and we had to get help to have it fixed. After 2 hours of waiting someone finally came to fix it but made it worse and we had to get a new room that had a broken tv and lights that went out on the last day. The hotel is also a bit too far from lots of attractions.
50,The Mandalay Bay is amazing and exciting! The ease attending a raider game walking is a plus! The casino is enormous and the food options are good. The bar areas offer dancing socializing video poker and convenience around the casino area. The stadium walk is easy to locate as well.
40,It was really good great experience checkout was easy however I’m still waiting to receive a incidental charge. And I feel like mine resort fee should’ve been waived because of the issues in receiving
10,Nasty and i call front desk and didnt not do anything eles after i call the second time around. When i check out i had explained to the lady and she just said oh sorry. Have a great day. Hope to see you next time
50,Stayed at Mandalay Bay on our last visit to Vegas. Rooms and bath were clean and roomy. The pool area was awesome. Away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to walk to center strip or hop on the monorail.
50,Wonderful stay with attentive staff. Highly recommend whether a short or long stay in Vegas. Many options within and fairly close to the resort. Looking forward to our next stay already! Hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did!
20,I had no real problems but I’d you want shade the pool pay for an umbrella cool drink of yours? Pay fir the privilege to use the mini fridge? Wanna float the lazy River? Don’t forget your own tube. Don’t want to hear your neighbors in the adjoins room? Bring your own sound proofing.
50,Only problem was the handicap room everything else was nice. I fly to Vegas a lot so I’m always looking to have a good time I marked everything positive because overall the stay was good but I really didn’t like handicap room
30,Check in was great (the front desk was very helpful and informative) room was average drain didn’t drain fast enough ice machine wasn’t working. But over all good. Able to combine our nights to complete a 4 night stay
30,Beautiful hotel but getting room issues taken care of was frustrating to say the least. We paid for a Stay Well room that never had any of the amenities that were supposed to be there. This was brought to the attention of staff four times and was never resolved before our checkout. Also we were passed over 2 and a half days by housekeeping and had to call the desk just to bring us towels.
50,Wonderful stays 2 BR suite was fabulous staff very friendly helpful and professional. VIP checkin was 2nd to none. I felt very welcomed and I’ll definitely be back. The restaurants were wonderful I highly recommend. The
50,The pools were amazing we played with the kids all day long. The nightlife was awesome too. Went up to the Daylight pool and had a few drinks and danced. Checking in and out was super easy too. Thanks for a great stay.
50,This is still our favorite resort on the strip. We love the layout the dining options and of course the pools. We felt the spaces were clean and safe. There were occasionally maskless individuals in the elevators and of course they ended up being the 'talkers'. The rest of the resort felt clean and safe; it is so spacious and well laid out. There are options for everyone here from fancy to casual; great bands in the casino excellent bar service at Hazel and Rhythm and Riffs. Close to the crazy action but far enough away to chill. Love this spot.
20,I asked them to pls make sure they bring my order right they said yes they will make sure and they still didnt....plus they talked to me with an attitude...and ut was 3 of them servers the two who got my order and the one who brought mu food
20,They chare 56 if you pick the trash up and leave a bag there . Also the internet sucks the movie i bought for 12 froze. The sink was clogged had to brush mine and kids teeth bent over bath tub . Ill take my business somewhere else
50,It was my 1st trip to Vegas since I was 7 years old I am now 50. Even though I am not a casino or gambling person i had a great time.i would certainly stay again! I hope to come back within the year!
20,The refrigerator is stocked with items and all items are weight sensitive. If you move anything or accidently knock something over it will cost you $50 for each item. Standard inroom free coffee is not free at Mandalay Bay. It is also one of those items if you pick up the cup or any item that will result in a $50 charge to your room eventhough you never used or consume the item. There are other nicer resorts in Las Vegas that don't take advantage of their guests.
20,They really need to make some changes with their Food and Beverage management and staff. They should also keep in mind If they aren't staffed to 100% they should book at 100%. To many bad experiences in a 3 day period to name everything and go in to details. I've been traveling to Las Vegas for family and adult only trips and this has never happened to me or anyone I know. I really though this was going to be a resort we can visit again and again I was Wrong!
10,"This ""elite"" hotel could not even provide wash cloths during the stay. Not just to me but many of the conference attendees. Highly do not recommend this place. It's a cattle-in / cattle-out place with very little customer service experience to make you feel welcome. It's a shame too because I would love to come back to Vegas with my spouse. But my experiences have turned her off of even considering a long weekend trip to Vegas."
50,Everything was perfect great service at the pool all the others guests super nice to us and amazing atmosphere in the casino definitely we are coming back specially to the adults pool it’s a good place to stay with your couple and get some quality time
20,Room was just okay nothing special. No wash cloths or hand towels was told there is a shortage. My traveling companions had the same experience in their rooms. One of the sink faucets didn’t work no cold running water the other faucet worked fine. I have stayed here multiple times time to look elsewhere.
10,Bring your own cleaning supplies and don't expect to be able to use the fridge for anything important like insulin. Hands down the most overpriced filthy room I've ever experienced. Will use my timeshare for business travel before I'll stay here again.
20,Two different rooms both had visually obvious grime mostly in the bathrooms- had to buy my own cleaning supplies and clean my room myself! With the prices here I should not have to clean my own bath tub and toilet!
50,had a great business trip bed was amazingly comfortable. Cleaning staff was very nice and provided us with towels as requested. They were very friendly. The only complaint was the weighted mini bar items. we touched one and were charged to the room for it. The charge was revrsed by the front desk staff.
50,A trip to Las Vegas is whatever you make of it -- gaming and fine dining spa and relaxation nature excursions -- and the Mandalay Bay will help provide all of the above or whichever kind of vacation you choose to have. The rooms are elegant and well-appointed the hotel has a ton of dining options from casual eats to excellent steakhouses like Strip Steak and the pools are fantastic. All-in-all it's one of my favorite hotels on the strip.
50,What more can I say than stay at Mandalay Bay when you travel to Las Vegas. Great staff service gaming spa beach/pools location to Raider's football. And the vegan restaurants available are AWESOME!
10,As one of the nicer M-Life properties was hopeful this would be a good experience. It wasn't hotel is tired staff was rude and overall food was sub par. Pick a different hotel. The only good thing is this hotel is close to the stadium for NFL games.
40,The room was nice sized and the bed was comfortable. The walls are very thin I thought people were on a balcony I could hear them so clearly and realized there wasn't a balcony. The in room coffee is $10- might as well walk to Starbucks. You can't store any of your own stuff in the fridge because it's a mini bar. I struggled with the digital key in the elevator saw a few others have similar problems. Went and got a normal key so I didn't have to ride the elevator up and down again.
10,"this place was a nightmare. they found my credit card and then between security and the front desk they misplaced it. told me security had it had me spend an hour with security. ended up being at the front desk the whole time. While the card was in hands 2:00PM-the next day the card had charges online for giftcards and clothing. they did not recitfy the situation they said ""we will discount your snack bar"" my brothers room had flooding in the bathroom. instead of giving him a new room they had him wait around all night.. still not 100% sure if they sent someone to fix the flooding. the TV didnt work in my room all night. someone knocked on my door 7:30 AM for room service we didnt offer. the morning before someone knocked 8:00 AM as well"
50,Mandalay Bay is the BEST place to stay for a Raiders game. You walk right out of the hotel to the Stadium Bridge which is maybe a 10min walk. Good room with seamless check-in and out process via your phone.
40,The hotel was nice. We had to switch rooms because we had neighbors who fought till 4 in the morning the first night and we’re extremely loud the second night. The room we got was a little smaller and the tv didn’t work but we were compensated for our troubles. The hotel is nice and has a friendly staff. Great location and lots to do.
50,Very convenient comfortable and fun hotel. We stayed for a convention that was held at Mandalay Bay. Its always great when you can stay at the same venue where your event is being held. Look forward to attending more events at Mandalay and staying as well!
40,The hotel is literally next to the airport so you could hear planes departing during the day. Not sound proof. Not loud just annoying. If you store a water in the refrigerator they charge you $50 just for using the refrigerator. That does not include actually drinking something from it. Conference center is really far from rooms but extremely nice. It's a smoking casino but you can't smell cigarette smoke unless you are standing next to someone smoking. Great air circulation. I didn't use the pool but it looked great from my room. They probably have a charge to use any of the pool chairs but it was too hot to be out there.
50,Mandaly Bay was a wonderful experience. Everyone was of friendly and helpful. The rooms were so clean and the air condition worked really well. We were close to the stadium for the game. It was a perfect weekend
50,Went to Vegas for Monday Night football and hotel was decked out and staff was great. Easy walk to stadium they have lots of events on gameday wave pool and restaurants outstanding especially the Irish pup upstairs..get the whiskey deviled eggs !!
40,Great and spacious resort. Warm and welcoming staff. I don't know what the scent is throughout the casino floor but it's amazing and refreshing - the first thing I noticed when I walked in. Good for families and there are a lot of adult only activities as well. Enjoyed the multiple pool options as well as the many restaurant options. Rooms were nicely decorated. Spacious bathrooms. Only thing is room services didn't always replace the wash cloths and sometimes left garbage and dirty dishes. Sometimes I would contact guest services and wait on hold or 10+ minutes but the world is short staffed right now so that's understandable. I would stay here again.
50,Mandalay was great - the room was nice large and clean and the staff was always helpful. Was there for a conference and the facilities were well maintained at all times. First biz conference post COVID and I felt safe - could socially distance and the hotel staff was diligent in having people indoors mask up which at the time was the state mandate in Nevada. Ate at the StripSteak - food was excellent.
40,Staying over Labor Day was taxing but this was a conference. Only complaints were the mini bar and the fridge setup. Not as bad as Peppermill in Reno but the fully stocked fridge is cheesy. Typical but still. “Don’t touch it or you’ll be charged!” They do warn you.
50,I was there for the NAPA conference and everything was fantastic from the cleanliness of the rooms and the very helpful staff. The bell staff was helpful in giving directions and check in staff was helpful as well.
20,Stayed in this property for a convention. Previous seminars visits were to Caesar's and the Venetian and they were considerably nicer properties than the Mandalay Bay. The property appears relatively tired. Service staff were pleasant. No wash cloths available during our stay.
10,I was treated very rudely by more than one dealer. Trust me I am not one of those obnoxious people. I spent $8000 on rooms and was expecting to be treated better. Staff acted as if I was an interruption.
30,Hotel is good but not what I expected. For the prices they charged pre-Covid I thought it would be really nice. Prices fair with Covid prices now. Check-in was delayed 3 hours so had to hang out in kid's room. Late to dinner. Rooms are getting tired nothing special. Pools are nice but drinks are $28 a little ridiculous. Also no shade at pool so have to pay $100 per umbrella and $100 for pool chair. Next time will enjoy pool at my home for free!
50,Arrived early and I was promptly assigned a room. Front desk check in and check out was quick and easy. Highly recommend renting a Cabana because service by wait staff was exceptional. Food at the Veranda Restaurant was excellent. Walk to Allegiant Stadium was so convenient.
50,Between the dining  casino  shopping live music and beach resort their was literally no reason to leave we enjoyed every second of our experience. They even had a wonder full coffee cocktail lounge that served amazing espresso martinis at night and espresso in the morning to start and end your day
20,Staff is just average. Not overly friendly and it almost appears that you are bothering them. TVs in rooms did not work (entire tower) was out and there was no urgency to correct the issue. The way they manage the room technicians is poorly managed. They don't like to take accountability for their issues.
40,We had a great stay overall! We stayed in a two bedroom suite which had a phenomenal view and plenty of room for two couples. The bedrooms on either side did stay pretty hot but the living area was cool. The water took about 20-30 minutes to warm up but once it got warm it was great! Would definitely stay here again!!
40,Distant from the Strip; Restaurants very expensive; Wished coffee was provided in the room in addition to a microwave oven. Staff was very knowledgeable and efficient; overall a very pleasant stay. Liked that you had to use your key to access you floor.
20,There was mold in the shower mold in the grout hard water stains and all of the Spicket‘s dirty tub floor the sheets didn’t fit the bed and they came off at night molding around the doors needed to be painted just showed wear. Not what you would expect from Mandalay bay
40,I stayed here for 3 nights starting on the Tuesday after Labor Day weekend September of 2021.    Check-in - I did on-line check-in. I finally gave up at close to 3 p.m. as I hadn’t gotten the notification that my room was ready yet and went to the check-in window. They assigned me to a different room. It was a bit of a downgrade – from the Executive King to the Elite King. Still a very nice room.    I love that they have a Keurig in the room. Comfortable bed very spacious room. Great bathroom lighted make-up mirror separate tub and shower. Separate water closet. I was in 25-233 – so a really nice view of the strip and airport. Mostly quiet. Some weird plumbing noises and apparently in Las Vegas they do road construction at 2:00 a.m. and I could hear it very clearly in my room.    Drinks - GO TO THE BAR. The drinks the waitresses bring you are horrible. How can you screw up a Bloody Mary? They have to use a machine now to make drinks! Save a buck save a buck! Yuk. Go to the bar where the bartenders make you a good drink!    The casino – it’s a nice casino. All the latest games.    Restaurants – I got take-out from Citizens a few times. Meh! Half the menu wasn’t available. I did the bagged room service one night. It was very good. Chicken Quesadilla was excellent. Very fast.    Housekeeping - I opted out when I did on-line check-in. For 3 nights I don't need someone cleaning up after me.    The Tram between MB and Excalibur is running again – which is good.    I enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay here again!
50,This was my second time staying at Mandalay Bay and it was exceptional. Everything is very clean and the bed was very comfortable. All staff members are very courteous and ready to help. Will definitely stay here again!
30,"Struggled at check-in and I'm tech savvy and in my 40's. Not sure that my parents would be able to figure out the digital key thing but guess it's nice to have a touch-free option. There wasn't anyone at regular check-in and I was prompted to ""print my own keys at kiosk"". Upon entering room there were only 2 bath towels for a 2-bed room. Requested face towels hand towels wash cloths. Bathr tub was not cleaned prior to stay nor during the stay. Beds were clean and room service was nice. I hate leaving bad review knowing about labor shortages but thought the feedback may help.."
30,Upon entering my 'huge suite' I found my expectations were not met. The room was much smaller than anticipated and it was dirty. Crumbs on the floor and chairs. The sitting chairs kept falling apart the arms kept coming off. The master had a beautiful view of the roof. The second room did have a wonderful view of the strip though. The hotel was far away from everything. Probably won't stay here again.
20,I recently stayed at the Mandalay bay from Friday to Sunday I was there a king-size bed and when I checked in they sent us to a two queen room and the room smelled of cannabis I called the front desk and ask them to move me to a room with a king size bed like I had reserved and they told me there was nothing available and was very rude about when I asked why they allowed me to book it online then I told him I didn’t want to stay in the room anyway because it’s milk so they said they would send me to another room with they sent me to a room with a word from you and did not accommodate anything to us and as I was walking down the hall I found that several other people had the same problem my Self parking was not hooked up to my room. So that made it difficult to get in and out of the parking structure I will stay in the rooms were very clean and nice along with the pool was awesome I’ve been staying at this hotel for many years but I feel like their quality and customer appreciation is going down most likely will not return to this hotel
50,A extremely wonderful experience the location options rooms and staff were the best!. I would definitely let my friend and fam come with me next fir the experience that this hotel has to offer. One stop shop literally.
50,Room are clean housekeeping come every day we where there and ballet parking is very good and front desk people gently and the casino is very nice the ladies that offer the drinks are very gently I love this hotel
50,The staff at Mandalay Bay is incredible! Top to bottom they are all good people. The music performers at the Hazel Bar were top notch. They played to the crowd and it got everyone excited. The Moorea pool is the coolest place ever! Big shout out to Hattie she is a legend. Andre was awesome too and really too care of us. I can’t wait to come back to the Bay!
40,We really enjoyed this beautiful hotel - the room the view were great - but did not enjoy the long waits to connect with customer service - to ask for daily cleaning service for example - that they otherwise do not do and they do not ask you about at check-in. God forbid you lose your key because the wait to get to the front desk on weekends in 20+ minutes. The Daylight day and night club party was a big disappointment . The music was very inner city rap - not my thing when every other word is an f-bomb. Drinks also average about $40 each so be prepared and seating is by reservation (with a food/drink minimum) only. For families the beach is awesome though - so they have.something for everyone. Bring your own floaties for the lazy river or they will sell you one for $45. s
20,Everything in the hotel was super expensive. There was even a $50 charge because we placed one water bottle in the refrigerator overnight. One person at the pool area wanted to charge us over $200 to use a chair.
50,This was my first time to Las Vegas and it was for business. I/We are planning to return in March for a personal Vacation. Absolutely Amazing. We are telling all friends and Family.  Thank You  Tamara McKain
50,I love this resort so much - you quickly feel at home here and the staff and service are 5 stars. This was my fourth time at Mandalay and certainly my most memorable visit for all of the right reasons. I hope to return soon!
50,This is my favorite spot! Who could say no to a sand beach great food and service and room views to die for? Plus Sharks? By far the best bang for you buck cost wise. You could easily spend all day just exploring this one property!
50,We have stayed here now probably 5 or 6 times in the last year or so. The staff rooms and especially the Mandalay Beach pool are simply outstanding. It is just a wonderful place to go and unwind for a few days. We will definitely be going again
50,I particularly enjoy this property due to the location away from the crowded center of the Strip. The staff consistently deliver a high quality experience. The craps tables have professional and friendly dealers at reasonable minimums.
20,The room itself was very nice. But upon arrival we found that there was the last guy's pee around the base of the toilet (so the toilet area was not cleaned before we arrived). We cleaned it ourselves because we didn't want to complain the first minute we got there. But this property nickel-and-dime's you to death once you are there. If you have a rental car it's $15/day to park there and half the properties on the strip let guests park a rental car there for no additional cost. If you use your refrigerator in the room it's a $30 fee. Bottled water in the room is $10 each. Little cups of coffee you get at every other hotel on the planet which you make yourself in the morning in the little plastic coffee maker -- $12 for two...so instead we walk to one of the two Starbucks in the casino and get two Venti Lattes for $11.79 (total incl tax). Walked to the pool to enjoy the pool I was told I needed to pay $100 for a lounge seat. Yeah as a hotel guest I needed to pay an add'l $100 to enjoy a lunge chair by the pool and the guy was standing right there to make sure I didn't enjoy a lounge chair unless I forked over $100. And they won't let you into the pool area before 9am. The sun is hitting the pool area easily by 8am...but they won't let you in to enjoy the pool area until 9. And many guests are already lining up to get in by 8am. Late check out -- oh not without a fee. We drove to the Mandalay Bay from a Marriott Golf Resort in Palm Springs where we also spend 3 nights 4 days. No extra fees there for parking in-room coffee use of the very nice lounge chairs around the pool... as soon as we woke up each day we could walk down to the pool and lounge relax -- we weren't locked out. I could go on and on and on... it is enough that these Strip Hotels kick you in the face with their BOGUS $40/night RESORT FEE. We all know those are just BOGUS resort fees to jack up their annual revenue by tens of millions of dollars every year. But to fee you to death on every other little thing on top of the nonsense Resort Fee... just goes too far. It made the whole trip seem annoying and petty.
50,Loved staying at the Mandalay Bay! It is off the main strip which I think keeps the larger amount of traffic down. It was easy to cab to the main strip when desired. The hotel pool and convention center were all well maintained clean and inviting!
10,I had very high expectations for this hotel after reading the reviews. However I had quite the experience staying at the hotel. I had an unpleasant welcome from a employee and we had complications with the room
30,Have stayed here in the past and the rooms and amenities are certainly feeling dated. Although we were happy to find an actual 2 bedroom 2 bath suite at a reasonable rate it soon became clear you get what you pay for. Thin “gas station” toilet paper and bath towels a barely functioning A/C unit in one of the bedrooms $12 for each in-room coffee “setup”that consists of 2 paper cups 2 K-cups and some powdered creamer/sugar and $12 for a bottle of Aquafina water are all things you’d only expect from the cheapest hotels. WiFi was spotty one TV didn’t work at all and the hallway smelled a bit dank. On a positive note the check-in folks and pool waitstaff were all great and the beds were extremely comfortable.
30,My family and I used to stay here for my dads work conferences and we wanted to bring our family back here as the resort is great for families. Could not be more disappointed by how slow and inefficient check in was. Crowded and huge Lin’s. We booked 3 rooms for our family and my parents back in March!!! and hours after check in time only one room ready. No problem we’ll explore and have dinner then I’ll be able to get my kids to bed….nope! At least by 6 pm our bags were finally delivered but still just the one room. After dinner my parents room was finally open but not our adjoining room. Tried to put my 6 month old to bed in Pack and play slightly broken and not even set up for us. My patents gave us their room but we had to split up our family and they didn’t have a place to shower till 8:30 pm. When the thud room finally clean. We are so disappointed this is not how we wanted our first night to go..
10,Spend a little more and stay at the Aria. This hotel is ghetto. Yelling and slamming doors all night will ensure you literally get no sleep at all. The pillows were also very uncomfortable and crappy.
50,Property is well maintained. Cutomer service is excellent. Family had a great time at the pool. Good dining choices. Clean and well maintained room. Great entertainment choices. We would return to this establishment again.
50,The blankets they use are soooooo comfortable and will be returning soon  They were very professional and nice and helpful we had kids with us and got us blankets and pillows for them was fast service !!!!!!!
10,Not sure we will ever stay here again. I just uploaded pics of our dirty bathroom! Pee stains on the toilet and trash on the floor! I’m disgusted that we have to pay over $200 a night for a place I had to clean myself because we didn’t feel safe! Previously we have had good experiences here so I hope someone from Mandalay Bay will contact me about this! I could not find a place to email these pics to complain on their website. If not—we will definitely NOT be back and would never recommend a filthy place to stay!
20,"Stayed here to see awesome Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson show and to enjoy the pool ""beach"" area as shown on website. However the pool area appeared as if truckloads of sand were just dumped on concrete. The area was surrounded by buildings and was just stifling. Shade was minimal. We did not even use the pool area after all. The room was somewhat dated but attractive enough. Bathroom was nicely designed. Otherwise few other positives... location is at very south end of strip (ok for long walks) tram service was occasionally unavailable with area just roped off with no explanation or signage. The worst aspect of the entire property was the horrible smells--combinations of smoke and some piped-in scents throughout--even outside. The air quality was far worse than any of the other hotels were explored. Luckily the theater was better with fresher air. The ice machine on our floor didn't work and after waiting for 2 hours for room service to bring ice we gave up.(You cannot access other floors for security reasons.) The phone app access to room/elevators only worked sporadically but fortunately we had one actual key made. With no ice we would have enjoyed placing our soda pop in the refrigerator but there was a $50 charge to place your own items inside! This is on top of the daily resort fee--which we did not benefit from at all. We only started with 2 bath towels that were small and threadbare (one had holes) but we saw a very helpful housekeeping staff member in the hallway who gave us 2 more towels. Pillows were lumpy and uncomfortable and we could hear noise from neighboring room. All in all this was a very disappointing stay at an expensive rate--not sure why it was so much as the Raiders game is not until Monday night."
40,Hotel stay was very nice. Property was beautiful. I booked because of the pool w/ temperature 110° outside. Pool hrs were 9am- 6pm. It was 100° at 10pm and REALLY Wanted to go to pool!! Pool is really my only complaint. Coffee was $6 cup in or out of room. DON'T TOUCH mini bar! Unless you want to pay dearly.
30,Coffee in room $10 and one water bottle $20. Room was nice but not as clean as expected (dirty bottle under stand). Beds comfortable but can’t use fridge as stocked with goods to buy. Lots of shows to see as they are connected to hotel which is very nice.
40,If you are need to a reasonably price well-apportioned room on the south end of the strip this is a great place to stay. The management has done an excellent job of keeping this property updated (unlike a couple of their neighbors just north). Appreciate the very attentive staff and the overall excitement. Definitely don't miss the wave pool and beach while you stay here.
50,My husband brother-in-law and I are shared a double room and everything was wonderful! Great view of the Luxor clean room and sheets and no issues with anything in the room. I would have liked to use the refrigerator instead of it being filled with their drinks alcohol etc but it wasn't a major problem. We'll definitely be back!
10,BLACK MOLD in shower in more than 1 spot. CHARGED to store your own drinks/ snacks in the in room FRIDGE. In room COFFEE MAKERS but had to purchase your own coffee. Had to pay 225$ to rent pool recliners and umbrellas at the pool. THIS PLACE IN A JOKE. WILL NEVER RETURN!!
30,They did not have many waitresses when gambling not one the whole four days asked if we wanted a drink you had to buy a tube for lazy rivet at $30 dollars a tube we were told the first day that they had no wash cloths. You paid $30 for two drinks.
10,They nickel and dime you starting with the stocked refrigerator in the room if u had food to keep in the refrigerator you couldn’t put in there because they had if stuffed with over priced liquor. No coffee to wake up too you had to pay for that as well. The only good thing about this hotel is that you really get the resort experience still drinks were too high and u had to buy the tu I g for the lazy rivet
20,When you pay over 200/ night at least they should provide have free coffee in the room. The housekeeping was very sporadic. Sometimes they would supply a wash cloth and hand towel and then some days they would not. The carpet didn’t feel clean.
50,The hotel overall was not nearly as crowded as some of the hotels in he middle of town. Very pleased with the rooms and service. Pools were excellent and the Border Grill had the best burger I’ve ever eaten.
10,Woke up with classic bed bug bites the second morning in hotel room. Notified front desk and was promptly moved while “independent” investigation occurred even though I showed them my bites and photos of debris found in mattress. No compensation for anything. I understand bed bugs can happen anywhere but their complete lack of customer service was disappointing to say the least.  Hotel is fine unless you have a problem. Then they really don’t care.
30,When we checked in to our first room it smelt so bad of marijuana that I had to call down to guest services which they changed my room which was a hassle. The rooms are starting to get dated and in the room I will see that there was a hole in the wall. I ordered room service and it was a very unpleasant experience as it was like a food delivery unlike other hotels where they serve you the food in your room.
20,bad experience room was not clean too loud  couldn't sleep called security they came 2 hours later security gave me a warning because i bang on the walls and ask them to shut up they kept the loud music 1/2 hour after security left until 7 am
40,The pool was awesome but when it closes at 6pm it doesn’t allow for people who check in to enjoy much time at the pool that day. Then it opens at 9am and check out is 11am. So unless you are staying two days you can’t enjoy the best part of this hotel. The pinball hall of fame is in walking distance and worth the side travel.
50,"This hotel and casino may be at the end of the strip but it has free trams to help get you to the strip easily. Also since it is not in the middle of everything you tend not to get a lot of the ""bad actors"". the accommodations are staff are wonderful"
10,Bathroom stinks dirty hair everywhere the floor was wet and the glasses are still wet and dirty! The room temperature was not getting cold. Called on the phone about parking and was given the wrong info. The only nice thing was the swimming pool. This hotel is overated!
30,For a big name room wasn't that clean no microwave fridge in room but full of things to consume (very expensive of course) you might get charged if you use the fridge and move items in it around. Two ply toilet paper that feels more like 0.5 ply bring your own! Lack of ventilation in toilet area.
50,we enjoyed our stay room were very clean and staff we friend excellent stay Highly recommend to family and friends the swimming pools are clean awesome way pool and lazy river very clean in that area the staff was very friendly
10,I want a refund because the amount out money I spent was not worth it. I am very disappointed in how your staff took care of the issues we had with you suite. The amount of money I spent I could of used at a different casino and hotel and got way better customer service
50,Great location in walking distance of many other hotels. Very helpful and nice staff best customer service experienced in Vegas. Very soft beds....I slept soooo well. The cherry on top was the large tub!!!!
40,We love Mandalay Bay and it did not disappoint. Check in was easy and quick. The room was clean and exactly what I asked for. The restaurant’s are expensive but the food was good. I have to give a special thanks to Shantel Kim Liz Pedro Cory and Manny at the pool they treated us great and took care of us like family. We love the pool at Mandalay Bay and it was great. Again enjoyed our vacation and will stay here again without question.
30,This is one of my favorite places to stay in Vegas. The rooms are nice although not as clean as my previous stays. The conference rate at the hotel was fantastic! Easy access to the casino the tram to a couple of other properties and walkable to a large portion of the strip. The prices in the restaurants and bars have gone through the roof however. It appears as though everyone is trying to make up for lost revenue all at once. The cost of the drink at the pool bar was the worst we experienced in Vegas.
40,Good I enjoyed myself the pool is fine not very crowded ATM fee was extremely high and then had to go to the cashier to get cash not cool cashier lady was very nice and funny had a great time overall.
40,I stayed here for a conference in the convention center. The room was clean although I thought the decor was somewhat dated.  The shower head was awesome but there is a weird spring -loaded hinge on the toilet door that kept closing on me. Not a big deal just kind of weird.  I only real complaint was the refrigerator with items in it for sale. My sense is they are on weighted spots so it records when you take something out. I took nothing out but when I went to check out online it said I had to removed a $12 item. Unfortunately by this time I was late to my conference commitments so decided I would just have to eat the cost as I didn't have time to go dispute it at the front desk.  Granted it's only $12 but if they got $12 additional from each guest at reach stay that would really add up
30,I booked this hotel months in advance with a king bed upon arrival they were sold out in the king and was stuck with a two bed room which is annoying because I had a queen or double bed and the other bed had no use. I have a king bed at home why would I want to spend hundreds of dollars to stay in a smaller bed. I was extremely annoyed next time I will be staying at the Wynn. Otherwise the hotel is beautiful.
50,Mandalay is a great place to stay with everything in one place you don’t need to leave the resort for any reason if you don’t want to. The room was clean with a great view and the staff was very friendly and helpful.
10,Very unprofessional security. Spend lots of money here often and this is how they treat their pearl member with a mlife mastercard. This place is a joke. Shutting my card down and never visiting an Mgm property again
30,Empty lotion bottle left in room on nightstand. Hair on “clean” bed. Room smelled like smoke. Makes you wonder what cleaning they actually do. Disappointing stay versus my first stay which had been pleasant.
10,Had car troubles getting there then they wouldn't change dates due checkin they don't state that on the site that if you use it they won't alter the room dates. Was unable to use pool and couldn't even use my comps that I earned
50,We booked a mid-week trip and had the greatest stay. The room prices were fantastic it was not to crowded the weather was perfect the pool was amazing and the restaurants were fantastic. This is a favorite place to go and I'm sure we will go back again.
50,This trip was a weekend getaway for me and my wife. So we can feel free and go out and enjoy life. Mandalas B at was a great choice. We had a great time. We Love the pools and restaurants. Can’t wait to come back there or a sister hotel.
10,The casino is old and tired. The machines are also old some being there since it opened 20 years ago.The restaurants have come and gone and there is no live entertainment for many years in the lounges  and unless one buys a ticket live music is non existent
40,Only problem we had was parking garage eating our ticket. Had to go back inside should have been free parking but still had to pay the $15.00 to get out. Very very frustrating. Was told veterans are free to park. That is the only problem we had on our trip. Otherwise I recommend this hotel.
20,Mandalay Bay street was closed & no instructions given on how to access self parking & had to go to Valet. & pay $30. The hotel ran out of wash cloths. No hot water. Maintenance had to come inside room to repair embarrassing for us because we were in pj’s and in bed. Also was late meeting family because we couldn’t take a shower due to the no hot water issue. Was charged duplicate parking fees no instructions on how to use room key to access parking lot. No instructions on how to access parking structure due to street closure because of stadium activity. It was a mess. It took 30-40 minutes waiting in line to get to front of hotel/valet. When we first checked into our room we noticed that there are red stains in the shower and the shower didn’t look thoroughly clean we wore shower shoes every time we showered. I will not stay at the Mandalay Bay again it isn’t a high end hotel anymore try the Wynn.
50,We went to Mandalay Bay for the malum concert. The 1 bedroom penthouse room was incredible.. everything about it was incredible. Dual AC for living room and bedroom bathroom with jacuzzi tub was incredible. Shower had no problem with hot water and keeping it hot.
50,Will definitely be back came for cosmo lord North America the show itself sucked but the hotel and resort was amazing ! 🤩 the pool is great shark reef aquarium was insane! Only thing I had an issue with was the stupid fridge that I didn’t even use beeping ALL morning lol
40,Our extended family gather to celebrate the 21st birthday of our oldest son. The pool area and shark reef were great for the two 16 year olds in our party. The only negative was the location at the end of the strip - a more central location would have made it perfect.
40,Great stay with a beautiful guest room. Amazingly comfortable bed! We used the pools dined and saw 3 different events. All at this location.  Lost a star because You cant use refrigerators for personal use in your guest room. Don’t touch or move the coffee kits or mini bottles from fridge or else you’ll be charged!
30,"The best part of this stay was the staff except when an issue arose then they were ""limited"" on what they could do. The A/C in my room was very insufficient and did not cool the room down and the only option I was given was to upgrade to another room. The parking was a joke when they offer Event Parking for Allegiant Stadium there is a line to get in the garage and you're lucky to even get a spot even though you are a guest and have already paid. Not very happy with my stay."
30,Hauled our luggage in the heat! When I called for assistance the staff did not care. They also did not offer to let me know when they were open again. Then leaving the parking lot our key did not work so made me late for my appointment.
50,My 3 years old son was having fun staying in there and cleaniness. And good experience bringing my family and staying in. Excellent experience. I highly recommeded to all my family and friends. Thank you!
50,Excellent stay. Nice and accommodating staff. Very clean and comfortable. Quality restaurants and nice variety.    Pool area is very slippery. We witnessed over 5 people fall in 3 days. Something needs to be done to improve this before someone is seriously injured.
50,Room was super clean service was terrific check in and check out was all done remotely and painlessly. Lost my key once and had it very quickly replaced. Our room was cleaned very thoroughly every day. Convenient location.
20,Paid approx. $700 a night to stay over Labor Day weekend.  Here are the reasons for my dissatisfaction.  1. Excessive charges. $700 a night! For a STANDARD room.  2. In room crappy coffee $10 a cup.  3. Slots are stingy and everyone loses their money. No winners in sight.  4. Restaurants I tried were mediocre and way overpriced (Strip Steak).    PROs  1. Resort pools are very nice and fun. Especially if you have kids.  2. Room was nice but for $700 a night I could have gone somewhere else and gotten a Suite not a standard room.  3. Ri Ra the Irish Pub was great. Food and entertainment were great.  4. Michael Jackson ONE show was awesome.
30,The hotel inside was very nice. Don't expect free coffee in the room and there is not a refrigerator or microwave in the room however I requested a refrigerator for my medicine and they helped with that. Also plan that they will put a hold on your card for the room bill for more than the room costs so put that into your budget. The bell desk staff was very helpful as well as the front desk staff.
40,Digital key was not ready at 3pm & only worked once. Shower should have been cleaner pillows needed to be changed out was getting flat and losing its shape. No face towels in the room apparently have to be requested now.
50,Came here to see Santana at House of Blues and stay in the hotel with my brother. This was perfect opportunity since I only get to see him once/twice a year. Venue was awesome and the hotel was great. Great check-in experience and the rooms were fantastic. Will definitely stay here again in the future.
20,They want you to use mobile app for Checkin and it is clunky at best. Mobile key doesn't work in elevators. Checkin line is crazy regardless the hour and takes for forever when you actually get to the counter. So unneccessary. Blocked self park garage off prior to game at allegiant and had to valet the car with took 45 min. Mobile key sometimes worked on door sometimes not. Poor processess at every step.
50,2nd time staying here and each ti is a better experience. Staff in all areas are amazing. Great restaurants. Clean rooms. Comfy beds. Quick check in and check out. Will definitely come back for a third and forth stay.
10,You will be greeted by no one and expected to find your own way if they have no open parking garages with spaces (events at the football stadium mean more than hotel guests). But they will still charge you for parking even though you cannot park there it non negotiable. Staff will walk in on you in your room. Overall cleanliness is sub par.
50,The rooms were nice and clean my room was available prior to the check in timeframe and the location to the stadium was convenient. The pool area was nice and I was able to find some loungers by the pool.
20,When we first walked into our room we discovered a dirty t-shirt and a used makeup brush behind the bathroom door. My wife picked these items up with a tissue and threw them into the the bathroom trash receptacle. The next day when we returned to our room after breakfast and some casino play we discovered that housekeeping had removed the makeup brush from the trash and placed it next to my wife’s cosmetic items on the bathroom vanity! Disgusting. We then received a phone call from the front desk telling us there was a plumbing problem and we had to move to another room. We were told to pack our stuff and come down to the front desk or to the mobile check-in desk “which ever line was shorter.” It took us 20 minutes to pack our belongings then stand in-line with our suitcases for another 30 minutes to get another room. We asked for an upgrade for the inconvenience but were told no upgrades were available ( I highly doubt that was true). We were then told we could have a larger room in the Delano but it would not be a strip view which our previous room was because that’s what we requested when we made reservations. Pulling our luggage through the casino to the Delano to our new room and unpacking took us another 40 minutes. This was NOT our fault. We felt that if we had to switch rooms someone should have come up and taken our luggage and escorted us to our new room. Our new Delano view was of the stadium and hotel A/C units (which kept us awake because of the noise). Terrible room conditions for a hotel which supposedly ushers in sophistication.
30,The app said you can go in with your phone. Phones do not get service. Then you have go and get a key. Also you can’t use the fridge. Also getting your car from valet express does not work as well. Thank you
50,Everything about this resort was fantastic from the lazy river and poolsTo the comfy bedding and pillows also the eateries specifically slice of Vegas ate there twice everything on the menu was good.
50,The rooms at the hotel we very clean but I did not like that I could not use the mini fridge because it was full of items to purchase not leaving any room to store beverages you bought for the trip. They also have a friendly staff. Their pools area is very spacious and you can relax.
20,Our room didn’t cool enough the view we purchased was not worth it so don’t pay the extra money! Checkout out was Terrible and made us late to the airport and had to pay extra to get there. I’ll get Cesar palace hotel instead on my next trip!
10,We went there to celebrate our honeymoon. The staff was rude and very condescending. They made us feel like we were not important enough to make our decision to stay there special. Never again! We decided to pay for our room since we were told we would be charged anyway and went to another hotel where they bent over backwards to accommodate us!
50,The experience was great I will stay here again. The rooms are amazing great in size. The casino is clean and they have great restaurants at the resort. The beach club is also good they have a lazy River that is a great lounging place.
50,Gorgeous property. Really surprising to find such a gem at the far end of the strip! The mandalay far exceeded my expectations.    I booked a suite and was upgraded to a penthouse!  It was incredible. The view was amazing overlooking both the strip and the airport and I caught sunrise and sunset several times overlooking the mountains and desert.  Room service was excellent I tried both the Seabreeze and the classic services and enjoyed both! The classic service is well worth the $100 minimum.  The minibar was well stocked and replenished daily.  The bed was very cozy and comfortable.    The 6 person whirlpool and marble steam shower were out of this world and I spent a good deal of time just enjoying them then sitting in front of the gigantic windows.  There is an invite only penthouse lounge on the penthouse floor and I hope to use it the next visit!  There is also a dedicated penthouse floor elevator that takes you to the casino floor with no stops quite lovely!    Surprised with how clean and well spaced out the casino floor was!  And the machines seemed pretty fair so no complaints there! Cocktail waitresses were friendly and quick and offered a lovely assortment of beverages.    Breakfast options are limited but the Cafe is amazing and the espresso was so good!    Food options have a wide range and its located close to several other mgm properties so you can always try something new!    Front desk bell services concierge and player hosts were all very attentive and informative.    Overall I was very pleased with this experience. I've stayed in the full range of mgm strip properties and thus far only the mandalay bay and bellagio are ones ill return to.
40,We stayed two nights in a base queen room via some MyVegas rewards ( check our videos for info -- Hops And Hardways ) The room was nice for a comp/reduced rate room. There were some crumbs (an almost completely intact dorito) and some pill case trash from a previous guest left behind so the room wasn't cleaned 100% but everything else seemed fine in the room. There was also a nice sized tub with a separate shower in the bathroom...so that was a nice surprise.    We had a snag with our reservations since we had two consecutive nights. I called ahead to make sure our reservations were linked and was told by reservations that they were. I also called from the room twice to make sure we were all set. I got conflicting information from guest services and was eventually told the best course of action was to bring my ID to the front desk for new keys. After waiting in line at the front desk I was told that they also needed my CC for the reservation again. So I had to go back to my room and get that. After two front desk trips everything was fine. Everyone was friendly enough but guest services didn't seem knowledgeable enough to handle a consecutive reservation situation without putting us out for over an hour dealing with the check out/in situation.\    A/C wasn't amazing...    I can honestly look past all of this but unfortunately the biggest draw back of this hotel for me is one that it really can't address - the location.    There is a tram that connects Mandalay Bay to the Luxor and to Excalibur but these hotels aren't on the same level as Mandalay Bay so if you're using the tram you are probably using it to get more north on the strip...which at that point you might as well be staying somewhere more north on the strip to begin with.    We did not gamble in the casino this trip but we have gambled there in the past and it is a nice and big casino...but staying here we always found ourselves wanting to be more north on the strip so we spent most days walking or taxi/uber/lyfting to where we wanted to go.    Overall I probably wouldn't stay here again. If the rooms were absolutely amazing I would maybe consider it but they weren't. I would take the same style room more centrally located on the strip if I had the choice.    I would probably recommend Mandalay Bay to someone who definitely wants to visit the south end of the strip or wants to spend a lot of time at the pool. If you're new to Vegas and want to do a lot of exploring I would choose a better location
30,Special Event should never disrupt a well know organization like this. I'm sure a Massive Email could've went out to all customer prior to arriving on this check-in date of Sept. I can't and will not give this anymore of my energy. Mandalay Stay Blessed
40,Beatiful place and great casino great rooms very spacious. The only downside was that no one was enforcing the mask mandate. That was a problem in this day and age.Most people had masks on but the ones who they feel smarter not wearing it were not promped to wear one
50,Got upgraded to a great 60th floor king suite. There’s a big hot tub - don’t forget to bring bubble bath! Lazy river tube requires purchase at the gift shop for use. Overall would def recommend to friends and family!
50,The room was great with a view of the strip. The room was clean and the service was great. The Adult only pool was exceptional for those that want to get away from kids. I would definitely come back to this Resort.
40,"Polite staff grand clean hotel sanitizing stations throughout security at elevator stations free tram to Excalibur or to/near the walkway bridge to NYNY corner of strip no buffet but a variety of food choices taxi service quick able to get us vans for 5 psngrs. Mc Airport to MB which is in taxi zone 1 so $19. ride..15 mins or so.    Big gentle wave at wave pool all seemed to enjoy. Lazy River can use float or just float without. You can buy floats there ($?)or take your own ring floats up to 48"" and inflate near river. West pool nice laidback. Walkways/sand hot so take slides/flipflops. Cabanas looked nice but there were open chairs the last week of Aug I was there. Can rent cabanas morng of if available. Pool area vry nice.    Weird no washcloths! Pay for coffee in room (took my own k-pods and 12 oz disp cps) must rent fridg for personal use (I took a foldable travel cooler)..I read reviews : ). Booked Panoramic Queen 2 Bdrm Suite thr mlife. Night before leaving itinerary suddenly read 2 Bdrm King! Desk clerk said I had resrv King I said no I had asked 4 a room # which was in notes. Also I talked to mlife twice 2 days before leaving about room/pool. I was told by clerk I could get a roll away bed! Anothr clerk overheard said smthng and I was given my PV2BQS! I rented 2 East Pool cabans T & Wed prior to leaving I cancelled.. plty of chairs on arrvl only 2 be told the East Pool is closed during the week. Perhaps verify your reservations a time or 2 before leaving."
40,The entire building is gorgeous. The hotel was clean comfortable and new looking. The pool complex is huge and I was able to find a more private area to relax in. The only drawback was there was not a ton of food options on property.
50,Staff was excellent. Lady at front desk gave me a room at 9 am. Rooms were amazing. I talked to a host before trip and she delivered great service. Been with Caesars for years. Smooth transition and and status match to M life. Very professional company ! Thanks
50,Mandalay Bay is by far the best resort to stay at. The rooms are big cleaning and very modern. The pool area is spectacular with many pools to choose from. Mandalay Bay sets the bar very high. I would recommend it !!!!
40,Great hotel but you will either walk 0.5-1.5 hours to get anywhere else or you will get a ride. Do not attempt to check in in person though the app will save you about an hour because the front desk is very slow. Amazing pool area and casino awesome restaurants I highly recommend.
50,Mandalay Bay has everything you need from steak house clubs bars casino and the amazing beach pool! Also staff was beyond helpful and made our stay feel like we deserved it. Beach pool was definitely our best experience at Mandalay specially on 110 degree days. Staff made sure we didn’t need anything from extra towels to drinks.
50,I love ❤️ this hotel 🏨 alot. Very clean. 2 things I experience wrong was they should have a staff walking around the pools and take un use towels on the pool 🏊‍♂️ chairs sometimes is hard to find chairs second wrong thing in the rooms the lady forget to replace hand towels and cleanix !! The rewards line are huge sometimes only one ☝🏼 person working there!!!
40,Loved the hotel and room. Online check in/out is very convenient. Beds were comfortable and pool area outstanding. Location isn’t great as you are at the end of the strip. Short Uber to a better location.
40,I stay at only MGM property's and Mandalay Bay is main go to room is great shape and clean staff very welcoming and there is a lot of things to do but they do have a lot of fee's and over priced services and at times it hard to find an open place to sit down and eat and my fav is still house of blue's is number 1 for me.
50,This really is a great family hotel. My kids love the pools and window shopping. This is our Hotel during any Venue at Raiders stadium since it’s a short walk over a bridge. Strip Steak is one of my favorite restaurants at Mandalay Bay. The Hotel Management Staff are exceptional also. Why stay anywhere else.
10,Garage was closed for parking to all. Spent over an hour to find alternative parking without any staff help or knowledge. Too close to stadium and when there’s an emergency nobody on staff was helpful.
50,Don’t move the coffee cups by the coffee maker they have a sensor and you will be charged$10 if you move one. Be  Careful not to set any packages by them they could get knocked over. Other than that this is a great place to stay. Very clean
20,Our stay was not what you’d expect from Mandalay Bay.  Our room wasn’t cleaned well. We had debris coming out of the faucet. We had no washcloths for 2 days.  They charged for in room coffee like a minibar. Also no personal items were allowed in the refrigerator unless you paid $50. to use it. We have never encountered a resort that charges for your in room amenity comforts…
40,The Mandalay Bay is a nice hotel in a great location. That’ll it the rooms smell the smoke. The water in my bathroom would never get hot so l took cold showers. Not a great place to stay if you don’t like the smell of smoke everywhere.
50,The pool was wonderful and clean! The staff was great and the room was very nice. Well ventilated and spacious gaming floor i didn't feel crowded like at alot of casions. Lupo by Wolfgangs was super delicious! Highly suggest!
20,"This year on my annual 'swimming vacation' at Mandalay Bay I sat down and read the services that the hotel claims are covered by their 'resort fee' . It doesn't cover bottled water or in-room coffee since they charge an extra fee for those...They DO provide wifi.. (so does the Motel 6...for free). They said that they provide ""Free local and 800 number calls That's just insulting. I paid an extra $78 for these 'services'. The digital check-in was glitchy and the pool which is the main attraction for me...was littered and dirtier than I'd ever seen it. Not a relaxing experience."
50,I don't know if it was because of fewer people fewer smokers or better ventilation but the strong cigarette smell in casinos that bothered me a lot in the past wasn't there this time around. The room was clean and we had no rowdy neighbors!
10,I would never come back to y'all..I was charged for resort fee that was supposed to be free and i  was still charged for it and I didn't received my deposit back. I'm just not coming back to yall thank you
50,The place was nice and clean and very roomie. I would stay there again if I had a good rate. My husband and I enjoyed it very much. I would love to go back and this time take some family members with joined suites.
30,The room was great. However every single thing will cost you. Coffee in your room is not complimentary and will run you a hefty price. There was mold in my shower and although I opted out of room service they walked in with their key card while my husband and I were still in bed.
10,"Room wasn't ready at check-in. Given a complimentary upgrade to a room that was ""ready"" but it was very dirty and run down (see photos). Previous guests items in fridge and their tags all over the room. Came and re-cleaned the room and offered $50 dining credit but other guests' tags were still in the room after re-clean. Very disappointed. Wouldn't recommend staying here maybe try the Delano instead."
40,Relaxing spacious atmosphere made feel comfortable during pandemic. Restaurants well finely served foods and servers manners under work reopend...Elevator take guide line and security control may improve covid safety..
50,Mandalay Bay was a very clean beautiful casino resort. Very spacious and floor area well planned. The room I stayed in was magnificent with a gorgeous view of the strip even from far away at night fall.  The room was truly a premium room with all the amenities one would look for in a room. Even the dining table was big enough for guests one might have including the nice sofas and couches. Well lit and plenty of room . Had a wonderful vacation.
50,In the midst of a world wide pandemic the relief and piece of mind of being a guest at this hotel proved to be a relief to the pressure and uncertainty of life in the rough lane . The accommodations delectable food  clean and courteous service aling with all the excitement LVwas the perfect anecdote and I can hardly wait to visit again!
50,My family of 5 stayed here for the fourth of July thus year and had such an amazing experience! The room was immaculate the customer service was great and the wave pool was so much more than we hoped for. We could have spent all day lounging out there in the sand! We had a small issue with check in so to make up for it they compensated our whole family with an amazing dinner on them ($25/person). Needless to say we will absolutely be returning!
50,Mandalay Bay / Delano Hotel has been our consistent first choice hotel for many years now. The pool and beach is the best in Vegas! We really enjoyed getting a cabana at Delano pool (still have full access to the Mandalay side). It’s a little quieter and less crowded in this area. The service is exceptional - shout out to Sabrina & Shay. Food drinks a TV for football games take in some shade and hang out with friends then go jump in the wave pool or lazy River to cool off. It’s the perfect way to spend a pool day!
50,Amazing along with out host. 5 star 🌟 for us. We got to go to shows and alot of shopping walking sight seeing on the strip Was awonderful can't wait to come back and do it all over again. Thanks again for all the great setvice.
50,Mandalay Bay is huge with a couple of pool options. We were there in May some of the things were still closed or had limited hours but it didn’t detour any fun! We aren’t really club scene people so we didn’t check into that. The hotel was clean and we got extra toiletries when needed.
50,We stayed here for a weekend with our teens after going to National Parks in Utah. This resort was very clean and beautiful. We enjoyed swimming at the pool/beach area. We arrived about 1-2 hrs before the pool closed and had no problem getting free chairs. The room was large luxurious and had enough room for the five of us king bed and pullout couch. It was nice to stay here and visit the south end of the Strip. We would definitely stay here again more time please!
50,Fun getaway nice room I did better than average on the slots and you will not find a better pool area for any age! Loved the wave pool!! Lots of meal options... I can't think of anything negative to say.
50,The “Bay” is my go to hotel for the majority of my Vegas visits. The rooms are very nice - comparable in my opinion to Wynn or Encore. The pool complex is one of the best on the strip. The tram service makes it easy to get to the strip. Always enjoy staying there.
50,Mobile check in and check out was a breeze the layout of the casino is particularly convenient when going to the pool. Staff was courteous and helpful. The food at the blues restaurant was excellent as well as the staff. I highly recommend this property especially because it's further down the strip and away from the traffic noise. The many pools are very family orientated
30,Some things were still closed due to covid. They are charging for parking again. The minimums on the table games have gone up. It seems MGM is trying to make it more difficult to come to their properties.
50,Really nice Casino! I know things are different with COVID and I feel the employees did a wonderful job at taking care of all the guests. Of course there are guests we heard complaining all throughout our trip. Yes some of the lines are long at check-in but that is expected. We used our Mlife rewards time get a couple of comped nights and when I checked-in. We stayed in a room with a really nice view and was really clean. The night life was really nice and fun atmosphere. You do need a key to access the elevators. Lines were long sometimes since they are trying to limit the amount of people in the elevators. Other wise the stay was good!
10,I will never stay at this crap hotel poor quality of service and room shower doesn’t even work if you call they take 30-45 mins to answer a call stuff is old and out dated in this hotel I will not stay here please do not make the same mistake I did!!!
40,The pool is the reason we choose this in Vegas and it did not disappoint. That said - it lacks some quick easy breakfast options. There was a bagel shop - but the line was always long. We ended up walking across the street to McD most other mornings.
50,Had to stay an extra night after spending my first three at another MGM Resort on the strip. Called M-Life concierge to book two rooms at seven in the morning for a same day arrival. M-Life is a true blessing! Reservationist was kind and pleasant.  Checked in at midday at the M-Life desk in the lobby. Bill did a fantastic job with the check in procedure. He was able to provide both booms on the same floor and with the same great view. (overlooking the new stadium). The rooms were great! Clean modern and the bathrooms are spacious!  My last day was purely leisure. Me and my family went down to the beach and enjoyed that immensely. The entire visit although short was wonderful. I would highly suggest this property if you are with your family.
50,Didn't realize that Mandalay Bay had 7+ massive Swimming pools for the family to enjoy. From Kids to grown ups. Cabana service available for many of the pool areas. I loved the service and my two daughters loved the pool.
20,AC Filter was so gross when maintenance came to change at 4am. Temperature in room never got below 70 so warm for sleeping. Had to change rooms twice as the blackout curtain didn’t close in our first room.
10,The housekeeping person barged into my room at 8am in the morning while we were asleep and then again at 5PM. I had do not disturb sign on the door but apparently it was not read. I called front desk and expressed my concern to which I was told it will not happen again. My privacy was compromised while i was in the room and I cannot trust how many times my room was checked while I was not in the room. Highly unprofessional.
20,What once was a great place to stay 15 years ago is now out of shape and needs work. Quality of people staying at the hotel were not the group I would hang with nor gamble with. Note Psycho Fest was going on and that did not hep matters.
50,Our overall resort experience at Mandalay Bay was outstanding especially the pool and cabaña! We also enjoyed the many restaurants that were available. Our favorite restaurant was the House of Blues.
50,Great selection of casino games top notch service and a prime location especially if you are going to see a concert or Raiders game at Allegiant Stadium. It's less than a 10 minute walk -I would return in a heartbeat!
40,Check in was fast and friendly... however when we got to the room it was hot 86 degrees... we lowered the temp on the ac. Left to dinner and a show ..came back several hours later and room was still hot.. we tried to sleep but after a while it was too hot... at 2 am we had to call the front desk to send maintenance to check the air... he came quick but it still took so long to cool off that it was daylight by the time we were cool enough to sleep ... that made the experience not so great
50,Perfect from start to finish! Needs to open the buffet back up! Needs that bus stop across the street to go down the strip. Other than that this hotel is awesome!! Lots to do and staff is very nice and friendly!
10,This hotel was very dirty! The rooms smell like vomit and housekeeping forgot the previous guests dirty underwear behind the curtains. I was moved five times before they could get me in a room that was clean. I was also way over charged for an upgrade that I didn’t ask for! I do not recommend this hotel to anyone with children.
20,This place definitely lacks personal service; could be because of COVID but the rooms had no directory in room for things—they claim it’s all online on the app or through QR code. I didn’t have the room WiFi password so I couldn’t download any information. My television didn’t work and my desk light would shut off intermittently (frustrating when I’m at the desk trying to work). When television did work nowhere did it state what time checkout was. The real kicker—I needed a bottle of water as there are no filling stations or fountains in the resort or casino. I grabbed a bottle that was on the counter; NOT from the minibar. They charged me $20 for a liter size bottle of Fiji water!!! They charge the same astronomical rates at their convenience stores throughout the resort. Who would have thought it’s cheaper to get water at the airport than it is here. Hardly any people here gambling at the casino—they can’t afford to if they charge $20 for water!
30,Room was clean but a little dated. Pillows could have been better. Concert on Saturday night - could hear it from room. Realize its Vegas and Saturday night but loud proofing was bad. Also Monday check out police were in elevator with people handcuffed. Good - Staff was nice except one wait at Fleur. Realize staffing issues are everywhere but he was rude and kept forgetting things - 3 asks.
50,The room was great loved that it came with a bathtub. The room was clean and the staff was friendly. The only issue I had was that the self check in wasn’t working. And the valet was not accepting any more cars due to a concert being held there.
40,My room was in nicely appointed. Large bath shower and double sinks in the bath. I do wish the AC worked a little better as there is no way the thermostat was correct. Only other issue with the room was that the shower drain wasn't working well. Told the maid and subsequently maintenance came within the hour to fix. No other issues and would stay again!
20,Everytime I've stayed here there always seems to be some kind if issue that arises. Last trip JASPER at the Mlife desk was exceptionally unhelpful & rude. I was forces to moved rooms and he charged me a late check out fee after I was already told I could stay in the same room for both of the 2 nights I payed for on separate reservations. His actions caused an hour delay I then was charged a fee from my driver service to delay my pick up time and was late to the concert I attended at Alleigent Stadium. Plenty of other places to stay on the strip pass on Mandalay to avoid the extra hoops you'll have to jump through.
20,Bathroom only supplied with 2 hand towels 2 bath towels 1 soap 1 condition 1 shampoo 1 lotion for 2persons. When asked for face cloths and more towels we were only given 3 bath towels. They stated they ran out of the other towels. We were also charged for drinks from the fridge when we only opened it to look at the items but none was taken. The coffees in the room are not complimentary each little coffee pack is $10. There is no sign stating this. We had a 3 day stay.
50,Rooms are beautiful lots of great places to eat casino is large and has quite a few old school slots also that at least pay out! All staff very friendly. Very large resort and the pool area is amazing with the reg pool hot tub lazy river and a wave pool with sand! Only complaint is there is very little shade in the pool area-you really need to rent an umbrella as it gets real hot!
10,Bathroom tiles were moldy especially in-between the tiles at the bottom. I felt disgusted taking a shower and the waitresses in the casino won't stop to take ur order. Casino also smell moldy on the section close to the bathroom.
50,Great staff and accommodations. Something to do for everyone. Clean and safe. Great food and shopping. The gazebo experience at the pool was amazing. It was a little expensive but worth every penny. Great view of Vegas from our room.
40,Relax and enjoy your stay at the Mandalay Bay. Fun times for all ages. Easy access to other hotels and restaurants. Noise level wasn’t bad even if the airport is close by. Our second time staying there and we love it.
30,Everything is self serve with limited hours. Each service desk has one function so don’t ask any broad questions. You check yourself in and make your own room keys. You can’t even store food in the mini fridge without suffering a $50 charge. It is an expensive place to stay with outdated rooms…. Just kind of ehh. Oh and the music festival at the pool blaring into my room at 2am was extra special.
40,I stayed at Mandalay Bay. The service was great and the room was amazing and clean. I was very surprised but it was quieter than expected. I really don't have a complaint about the room or the experience except they should give free coffee in your room. The room is very well stocked if you want to pay high prices for anything such as coffee or drinks or food in the refrigerator. If you want to store anything in the fridge it is a $50 service charge. I think that is ridiculous. Give the guests that pay high prices for the rooms free coffee and free fridge!!
40,Get a regular room key!! The room was nice enough. My biggest frustration was that I used a digital key and when I arrived I had issues with the digital key working in the elevator. An employee happened to be in the elevator at the time and used their key card so I could get to my floor (employee indicated there are always issues with digital keys). The key worked in the room. I went to a concert at Allegiant stadium that night and it was about 12:30am when we decided to go to our room. The key card did not work at the elevator again. We even went up with another guest while continuing to get it to work. Then we got stuck because we couldn't go anywhere.. until we made the elevator go back to the lobby. We went to the lobby to try and get a standard key and the line at the front desk was about 20 people long. There was no way I was going to stand in line for 30-60 minutes to get a key to my room because the digital key wasn't working. I found an employee who after a 5 minute wait took us up in the elevator and then opened our room just in case the key didn't work there either. It took us almost 20 minutes from start to finish to get to our room after a fun night. It really put a damper on the evening. If the digital keys are problematic that should be made known to guests and there should be a way for digital key users who are having issues get a standard key without waiting in the crazy long check in line. *The mobile check in desk was closed.
20,Loud rock concert outside our window until midnight- 2 nights in a row.  No hand towels or wash clothes available- only bath towels.    Staff who made promises not kept.    MGM should have stuck with making movies not running hotels.
50,Everything that we did throughout the MGM Resorts was outstanding. Every employee that we interacted with provided outstanding service and support. We were always treated with the upmost respect and dignity.
50,The hotel is always kept up and the rooms are very nice... There were a few things that I was not happy with while playing on the Casino Floor at the slot machines I must of played for at least three hours and never saw a cocktail server which I think was very poor service...Also in the High Limit room they didn't have anyone to help you if you needed funds from your credit line they made you walk across the casino floor the Cashiers cage I believe that should be one of the benefits from gambling in that room ..
50,One of my favorite MGM hotels in vegas. The pool area is unbelievable. A huge pool with a wave pool and a lazy river. The casino floor is massive with a bunch of different table games and slots. I’ve stayed here already twice this year and will plan on booking again in the future.
50,Mandalay Bay was perfectly located! The resort provided all of the amenities that one could use while of vacation. Tons of restaurants activities and entertainment. The resort provides a train that takes you down the strip which was a plus. Overall a great experience.
50,I booked through priceline where you don't know what hotel you will be getting. It was for one night. I was pleasantly surprised. I went ahead and bought tix for guns and roses concert at the very close allegiant stadium. Very convenient to ealk to.    There was a huge check in line but it moved fast. Our front desk guy gave us a double upgrade but he moved us to the delano. It was a bit of a walk through the casino. No problem. Our room was on floor 20 of 23 and it was a 900 sq ft suite. I booked the least expensive room lol. We had a living room wet bar separate 2q bedroom waterfall jacuzzi 2 bathrooms and 3 tvs.    We had an issue with the lr tv. The engineer came up within 15 minutes fixed it and gave us a voucher for $25 towards food/bev for each guest. We had free breakfast. Dellas custard cakes are to die for. Every single staff member we came into contact with went above and beyond. The bellstand held our luggage until we were ready to move over to the park mgm. We are in a reg room here lol.    We were spoiled.
20,The mini bar in the room was the most expensive I have ever incountered... and in order to see the prices you must do it through your TV (cause they don't want you to see what they are going to charge you... i.e. $20 for bottled water). I had several encounter with employees that either seemed annoyed that I needed help of were just unconcerned with customer service.
50,Mobile check in literally allowed me to walk into the resort and go DIRECTLY To my room! I loved it! It was amazing!!!! Room was super clean and comfortable. We will definitely be back!! Looking forward to pampering ourselves again!
50,Always love the ambience in Mandalay. Been there so many times. One thing I can say though is that I had a couple drinks while playing in the casino and the drinks were really watered down. Dissapointed by that.
20,The hotel is in a great location. I attended the hotel for a convention but there were plenty of others there for the casino and pool. The electronic key didn't work in the elevator which I heard was a common issue. It didn't work for the room door so I had to go back to the desk to get card keys. My TV stopped working the 2nd day there and I placed a call to get it serviced. Nobody showed up for the remaining 3 days that I was there. Several times I got into an elevator and pressed my floor button only to have the elevator not move. I had to get out and get in another elevator. The convention center is very cool compared to the rest of the hotel. The food was sub-par.
50,Mandalay Bay has up kept it's quality when it comes to hotel rooms. However there are small things that could be improved more so modernised. The operating hours of the food court are not correct due to COVID- and they have protocols in place for safety. Overall another Great Trip!
30,Mandalay was ok my complaints were the parking garage was at opposite end of building and not easy being a handicap patron.Free Valet services should be offered for all handicap patrons. Free in room coffee is available at All Hotels not Mandalay $5.50 plus $12 for the water bottle is ridiculous. I’d take the Free coffee over the tiny bars of soap and shampoo
30,Being able to walk to the convention center was helpful. Had I not receiver an excellent price I probably would have passed on the convention all together. It turned out a couple days in my life gave me some business leads and a reasonable travel experience. Thank you
50,Best location on the strip with trams getting you where you need and the staff is awesome . You don’t get questioned with every cocktail you order like other properties. And the slot attendants help with a smile and friendly . I love in Vegas and some other properties have people that roll their eyes like it’s a chore and don’t want to be bothered. Mandalay Bay is the best all around resort
30,Once again the suite I booked was not available and once again I received a less than what I booked and paid for. Once maybe twice even three times but when over half of my bookings at the Mandalay Bay end up with a room that was less than my booking and worse less than what I paid it makes you wonder if this is possibly a larger problem with their system and screw people all the time.
50,Viri was an excellent front desk agent. She was very informative and guided me well through the online checking. Nice relaxing day by the pool as well. No complaints at all and we'll be returning very soon.    Thank you 😊
50,Arriving at the hotel was real easy. Checking in and out was a breeze because of the online service. Accommodations and accessibility to casino and pools as well as other hotels was very easy. Overall a fantastic hotel.
50,"We used to stay at MB several years ago but have been staying at Luxor the last several years. What a nice pleasure is was to return to this ""gem"" in Vegas. Our room check-in experience casino staff and food was all great. We will return..."
50,Hotel was clean comfortable and made for a great stay during Psycho Fest! Restaurants were all top notch the beach area was fun and the staff were all friendly and attentive. Looking forward to coming back next year!
20,The room was nice for a one night stay. Linen had food left over from the previous persons stay. Housekeeping will interrupt your morning hours before check in. Enjoying private time with my wife for a member of the housekeeping to open our door. Maybe they should install the real safety locks to prevent staff from coming into rooms that are marked not to disturb hours before check out
30,Came here for 4 nights. I am a MLife Platinum and Hyatt Globalists after valeting my car I checked in. There were no king rooms available amazingly on a Monday night in a giant hotel like Mandalay Bay. I was sent to Delano and had to get my car and drive there as they had a king room there and I knew they are suites. Got to my room and what I got was a small second bedroom to someone’s suite. Staff says room equal to room I booked at Mandalay Bay. In the morning no one showed up to open the fitness center and had to trek back to Mandalay Bay to work out. I then went to the fro t desk to inquire why I am in a secondary bedroom. After a unreasonable answer I asked to be put in a regular room at Delano. They offered me to go back to Mandalay Bay or as a courtesy go to a queen room at Delano. I chose the queen room of course. I also found out the little lounge they have next to check in now requires you to have a compted room to enter or $75 a day to use. They have coffee tea beer and wine in the lounge. No food. The gym did reopen the next day and the rest of the stay was uneventful. I have found status at hotels including this one means nothing in this new world of traveling!!
40,Nice very clean place to stay however the resort fees in room items and pool fees are very over rated. They charge for everything including coffee in the room small liquor bottles and room service is very over priced. Swimming pool charges are very pricy for a umbrella and 2 chairs is $250 dollars.
40,The rooms were great and clean. I had a pool view and the concerts at night were very noisy. I could hear just the bass booming in the room so I couldn't sleep. Also no free coffee which is ridiculous since they have a Kuric in the room. I have stayed at a lot of hotels and this is the first time I have encounter this Also- no frig and a $40 a night charge if requested for personal use (absurd).
40,The hotel casino is large and beautiful. Has 5 pools and sand like a beach. Unfortunately the days that we were there the pools closed at 5pm with no warning. There is no microwave or refrigerator in the rooms. As hot as the weather was in August it would have been nice to have something cold in the frig to drink! Wait there is a refrigerator in the room full of drinks that you can purchase at some ridiculous price! Located at the end of the strip not really close to anything.
30,I attended a work conference and checked in on a Sunday night. There was a loud rock concert in the pool area that made it impossible to sleep until after 12:30 am when I needed to be up very early for work the next day.
50,The service is perennially excellent at Mandalay Bay. I go for the pools but enjoy the selection of restaurants and shops. I recommend Strip Steak for the best meals and signature cocktails. The lunches served chaise-side are promptly served hot and hearty.
50,My stay at the property is always a great experience. From the time you step onto the property you feel welcomed and taken care of. From the rooms to the Beach facility to the dinning options. Something for everyone in the family.
50,I stayed at Mandalay Bay for the first time this past week. I have eaten at Stripsteak years ago but other than that I had never been to the property. It was fantastic. The staff was very friendly and helpful the amenities are awesome and the room was beautiful. The only drawback is that in order to get the the hustle of the Strip it is a little bit of a walk. I don't mind this because I love to exercise but this could be something others might not like. Really though if not for COVID all of the shops and restaurants would have been open and there would have been no reason to leave the property anyway.
30,Rooms and restaurants were great - whole property reeked absolutely reeked of smoke. No matter how much circulation they have it's not enough. Staff was very helpful and COVID protocols were enforced
50,who's always available to answer questioned you may have and very accommodating at all hours of the day.The Mandalay's housekeeping dept has always maintained a clean and welcoming room environment.  It's a pleasure to check in or out at the reservation desk. The desk clerks are efficient and knowledgeable answering any questions you may have.
50,Very nice property. Polite staff. Nice selection of games in the casino. Too bad more food wasn't available due to Covid. Hoping to come back soon when conditions get better. Would like to enjoy all the amenities of your property
30,I have always enjoyed Mandalay Bay as my number one choice in Las Vegas. This time was no exception unfortunately my companion was hurt in the wave pool and although attention was good a formal report was never made out. I also encountered a wondering soul in the hall on my room floor after he left the elevator with me. I think he would enter the elevator with a crowd and exit at any random floor. This lead me to believe your key system used on the elevators was flawed. Thanks.
50,Front desk was nice enough to give us a room upgrade for my bday for only 25. Clean room and beautiful strip view. Comps are great. Pool is fun. I recommend. My parking key didn’t work so I did call them to let our car out but other then that great service!
50,This hotel resort and casino is amazing the staff are very friendly the machines are very friendly and the pool area was amazing.  this first class resort is great for families and great for adults as well!
50,Even an old couple like ourselves can figure out the no contact check in. The pools are great and plenty of places around the pool. I can't wait for all the restaurants open but still plenty of places to eat.
30,I was not happy that I had to pay for coffee in my room. Nothing was offered as a amenities. The room was clean except that there was a was of hair in the bath tub! Not cool. The positive was that the people at the bell desk were fantastic. I'm not sure if I would stay there again. It was my granddaughter a 21 St birthday. I mentioned it to the front desk and nothing was said or done. Disappointed
50,What an awesome stay! Everything worked out better than expected. Online check-in was smooth room key on the phone worked quickly most of the time. Only downers were the limited seating in restaurants making it hard to get food on the fly and getting no responses from the digital concierge.
20,Just checked in to a premier room and this is my view! And it wasn’t the cheapest rate either! Plus they advertise the aquarium but it’s an extra $36.00 per night. What a rip how disappointing after I have looked so forward to this trip
40,We visited Mandalay Bay for 2 nights in July. Check-in went smooth. GREAT service from the bell staff especially Alberto. Tried the $20 trick but the front desk staff said they had no upgrades.  We stayed in a Resort King room that overlooked the pool. The room and bed were very comfortable. And the bathroom was spacious. Plenty of vanity space with 2 sinks. Only went to the pool once. The second day the pool was closed due to lightning. But we loved the pool area. No problems at all. There is a nice lounge in the middle of the casino with mellow live music. A great way to finish the day.  Overall the staff was great. Valet parking was a little slow but I attribute that to being extremely busy and understaffed. Would we stay there again? Absolutely!
10,AC was not working first 2 nights. Hotel offered nothing for the inconvenience. I was in their panoramic suite for 4 nights. They only sent an AC guy on 3 rd day and he fixed it but I had to pay everything in full.
40,We never stayed here before but we will again in the future. It’s great because you’re not shoulder to shoulder with people like you are down towards Ceaser’s. Fantastic pool. Top 3 in my favorites. The only knock was the room service was stopped at 9:00pm. We understand that finding employees these days is almost impossible and we understood this so we just went with it.
50,Great variety of quality restaurants one of the better pools in vegas and well laid out casino. Employees are all very courteous and informative as well.    Rooms are all of suite-like quality.    Location had always been the only drawback but now Mandaly is the place to stay with the opening of Allegiant Stadium.
30,The cocktail service at the slot machines was terrible with waits of up to 45 min. between servers.  We have a Noir card and are supposed to get preferential seating but when we presented our card at Sea Breeze we were told that it would be a 30 min. wait and that our card would not get us seated quicker
20,"When we told the front desk (in person) that the towels were shredded and dirty he said ""don't worry you wont be charged."" Never offered to have new clean towels delivered. The kids could not sleep due to excessive noise from the apparent metal festival outside out room. If there would have been a notification before purchase we would have went elsewhere. We instead had to deal with nights of screaming growling and upset kids until the concert ended every night at midnight."
50,We had a good trip. The casino was cool and comfortable. The room was very nice but we couldn't get the room to cool down to a comfortable temperature as desired. Everybody in our group enjoyed their stay at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.
50,Starting to see issues with the rooms every time I stay. I feel like I should stay at the other properties. My curtains wouldn't open. I had issues with the card readers on the elevators. I tried to buy a soda from the vending machine on the 18th floor. The machine didnt count my change and also couldn't get a refund. Somebody set the machine up to collect money. I've seen the fraud setups before.
50,My husband and I had the most amazing time. The hotel was the best and the cleaning ladies were awesome. We never had to ask for anything. Everyone was super sweet and very helpful. Going back every 3 months
50,The hotel was great i checked in with the App and arrived early my room was ready definitely going back. They have a good selection of restaurants (wish more of them where open). Lots of slots where open.
50,The hotel and staff were awesome. Lot's of food choices and a awesome pool. We will be returning soon! The Casino was not over crowded with a lot of space between machines. The table games were also spread out and not over crowded.
50,Mandalay Bay is an amazing property on the Strip. It’s large has a great pool for the summer and was very clean even in the midst of a pandemic. I’ll always stay at the Mandalay Bay! It’s close to the shops and has a great selection room of restaurants to choose from. Definitely recommend.
20,Sooooooo many reasons:    We reported no hot water on our 2nd night and no one came to fix  We report our AC and no one came  The pool closed daily at 5:00 for our entire stay we were never told this and we would have stayed somewhere else if we would have known.  Could no use our refrigerator for personal use and were told it would be $35 a day to use it.  Loud concerts each night that could e heard in our room on the 22 floor. No one told us.    Andddd to top it off a shortage of face towels. Told by the front desk and maid service we had to request them daily and have them brought to us.    Horrible horrible horrible!
50,My wife and I traveled to Las Vegas in July of 2021 to attend two weddings (one being our own!) We chose Mandalay Bay after reading dozens of reviews and comparing prices and amenities of all the resorts on The Strip. We decided to stay in a Stay Well room and we’re glad we did! The air filtration aromatherapy and vitamin c infused shower head were surprisingly relaxing and made for a super comfortable atmosphere. Staying on the end of The Strip wasn’t the hassle we expected; we had easy access to and from the airport and the tram to Luxor/Excalibur was convenient for getting closer to anywhere we planned to be. The casino floor was perfectly spaced breakfast at Seabreeze Cafe was delicious and service was unbelievably personal/attentive the beach was a relaxing getaway from the sights and sounds of Vegas and the shops between Mandalay Bay and Luxor offered great variety for souvenirs and shopping in general. One underrated feature was the dedicated ride-share pickup/drop off location. We’ll definitely stay at Mandalay Bay again maybe next time a suite at Delano!
50,We loved our standard king room with pool view. The large bathroom is always our favorite - big tun and shower with separate toilet room. The spacious room was very comfortable especially after a previous stay at NY NY where there was no space to stretch out or place open luggage. The TV was larger as was the nice full length mirror in the entryway. Very comfy bed. Staff was very accommodating. Only downside was the wait to catch an elevator at check out time on Monday we walked down a few flight of stairs to find a floor that didn’t have many people waiting - took about 30 minutes to get to casino level I’m sure this is the situation at all the striphotels.
50,I continue to select Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino as it is very affordable the staff are friendly the place is always spotless and the locality is great because I like to walk to the other casinos for exercise while on vacation so its perfect and when I get tired I can take the Tram back. The food options are plentiful!
50,Never stayed on the property but I’m glad we did . Our room was quiet and we had a great time . There was plenty to do on property  we had a nice time at the roof bar  great drinks and plenty of site views from the top
50,Really nice hotel resort and always HAPPENING! If you're planning a trip to VEGAS then this is the HOTEL to stay! Amazing POOL! Amazing restaurants! Amazing CASINO! Also close enough to the strip and a short drive to the airport.
50,Absolutely wonderful! From being locked down and at home all summer due to the pandemic the entire staff at Mandalay worked their take off to provide excellent services. We are truly appreciative of everyone at the resort. We would definitely stay again as it’s extremely family friendly and the price is right!
50,Took our first visit to Mandalay bay in June and we had the greatest time. Easy access to the elevators and quick access to the beach! Room service was th best.. Will be going again with more family the next time.
40,The hotel is safe clean and has the best pool. There was still restrictions during the time of our visit but it’s all good our kids were safe to roam around there’s so many restaurant to choose from and you can just go to luxor if you need fastfood. Mandalay will always be our hotel now and the fast and easy booking is a plus.
50,Mandalay bay has become my favorite resort to stay with on the strip. Great dining shopping shows. The pools are fantastic. And the view  from your room is marvelous!! The tram ties the resort to the rest of the strip or just take a lovely walk down the strip!
50,This property has everything you need! That are great food options within and nearby! The beach is AMAZING! We really enjoyed the wave pool. VIP services is such a great valued for the money- we had roundup luxury airport transportation refreshments and access to our own check in desk. The rooms are clean and the bathrooms are spacious!
30,I get a solid vacation about once a year We went for a music festival on the property called Psycho Fest. I got our room at an exceptional off season rate through MLife rewards. We stay at the Beau Rivage so I am used to to high standards they operate by. I’d like to see the property update it’s high limit area.
50,What a fun beautiful time to be had!  Many things to do and eat inside the hotel and the beach/swim areas are amazing!  My hotel view was looking over the beach/pools below and the magnificent mountains out in the distance! Will be staying again next year when I visit!
40,The staff was friendly clean room no rift raft pleasant crowd. The pool was great pleasant staff there as well. I think the casino does a good job on weeding out the rift raft. Customers were not ghetto fabulous.
50,I was there for Psycho Fest and had a great time. Thick windows kept the room very quiet. Elevators need updating and were tricky to operate with room key but otherwise everything was awesome! Nice food choices too.
20,The air conditioning in the room is sub par the fact that they have RFID readers for room keys in the elevators is annoying enough but then half of them don’t work; you’re standing there sticking your room key up against it and pressing your floor button continuously like a retard and the button lights up and then goes out. My friend got kicked out of the casino for “swearing” by one of the pit bosses.
30,The $12 charge for k-cup coffee in a paper cup that you have to make yourself is frankly offensive and gives the vibe that this hotel is here to nickel-and-dime you. The beds were comfortable the room was clean the hotel is starting to show some age but overall is still nice. Check-in was slooooow and staff was scarce but I think that’s everywhere right now. It really was the insulting charge for the cheap coffee in-room that tainted the stay for us.
50,Outstanding experience staying at the Mandalay Bay. Definitely recommend getting a physical room key and forgoing the app to use as your key. Highly recommend eating at Lupo and Stripsteak. Next time we hope to use the gorgeous pool.Otherwise an excellent experience.
30,The room was nice BUT...Way too many petty charges. When you are charging a $39 daily Resort fee it should include DIY coffee in the room parking and a bottle of water in the room should not be $20!
40,Could've been awesome if the shower wasn't clogged key inoperable phone too much static tv blanking out. Trying to celebrate my girlfriend's 50th birthday but had to stay in my room for maintenance
50,the water park was fun with lazy river and wave pool and room was clean and comfortable and the staff was very friendly and helpful and looking forward to staying there again the only thing is with lazy river bring your own floatation device because they wanted 34 bucks to rent one but they have air pump there to pump up your own
10,I was very excited to say at Mandalay Bay as I have heard very nice things about it however my stay was not such the case. Mobile check-in was seamless however the mobile key only seemed to work about 50% of the time so I opted for standard keys. The room had multiple lamps that were totally or partially inoperable. The Ice machine on our floor was not functioning for 4 days. The pools were dirty. When trying to ask one staff member for directions somewhere he completely ignored me and continued walking past without hesitation. If it weren't for the convenience of location to the reason I was in Vegas I would've stayed somewhere else.
50,We were in town for an event at Allegiant Stadium. For that purpose it was perfect! The proximity to the stadium is great. It’s less than a 20 minute walk to the stadium. I can definitely see this being a go-to resort for Raider games. The resort is very clean and offers a lot of food options. Rooms are very spacious with large bathrooms and floor to ceiling windows for great views. The only downside is due to the location on the southern part of the Strip the rest of the resorts and casinos require a lot of walking or an Uber or taxi.
50,Great place to stay friendly stay and very helpful. Rooms were very clean and modern. Great view of the strip from my room. Great casino floor and lots of food choices at the food court. Easy to get around
50,A few friends traveled from the Midwest to one of our favorite Vegas Resorts. In fact this was their trip since March 2020. Especially enjoyed the pool as the staff provided service. Room service was also spot on.
50,Visited for the Psycho Festival.    I had great service on the casino floor and at every desk bar restaurant and music venue I visited.    Contactless check-in and check-out are super efficient    Room was spacious modern clean    Delicious food options for every budget    staff and music venues are top notch    I plan to go back next year.
30,We did not have any wash cloths and we were told they had a shortage and to use hand towels. I attempted to work with the staff but I ended up having to take a Uber to tj maxx to 10 wash cloths. Which was an added expense to me.
30,Rooms needs more work they look kinda dirty also casino the odors it’s way stronger and mix with the perfume you guys use omg that was nauseous but staff were really nice when I do check in and everything it’s just the hotel not the staff.
50,We had a great time at the Mandalay Hotel. Celebrated my son's 21st birthday at the Psycho Las Vegas Rock Festival \m/ \m/ Rock On!!! We will definitely be back to enjoy the swimming pool area some more and as a home base for Raider games GO RAIDERS!!!!!
50,Enjoyed the entire long weekend. Only issue my wife had a sore back perhaps from the soft mattress. Other than that enjoyed Ri Ra curry fries and live music. Wave pool and lazy river were excellent. Saw the Michael Jackson ONE show. Well done.
50,My stay here was amazing! Staff was great environment was exceptional but a few very minor inconveniences. But nothing not to warrant anything less than perfect score. Such as ice machine being out of service and having no access to lower rooms.
50,The room was spacious and clean. Accessibility to the room was good. The digital room key was annoying we ended up getting a room key so it was an easy fix. The house of blues was amazing and The Fleur was delicious. We also dined at the foundation room super pricey but worth it the view from the rooftop was outstanding and the music was fun!
40,I traveled for a convention. We stay at the Mandalay Bay so it is nice and close to the convention center. The restaurants they have on site are delicious! The beach and pool area are great! The room was nice and clean it could use some USB ports or more plug ins for electronic devices. The staff is wonderful and very helpful.
40,Room was good. AC was cool but not cold and warm in the middle of the night. Bathroom needed more attention prior to my arrival but not horrible (bar soap pieces in shower floor). Bed sheets are flat not fitted they didn't cover the entire mattress. My feet were on the actual mattress. I didn't contact the hotel with the issues. Staff is Very friendly.
20,I’d pass on Mandalay for now it’s not the same place it used to be Security was rude and actually put hands on one person in my party ! There was a water leak on my floor that they never fixed all 3 days !
20,Rooms need a refresh- very dated.  Location at end of strip was not convenient. Food and drink prices were significantly more than other premium hotels.    Unless one pays sizable additional fees the pool area is too hot to use on the summer. The resort fee did not include pool cushions umbrellas or shade.
10,Room Confirmation: 891255758    I just got back from business trip with my girlfriend. I felt so bad with your refreshment charged. I knew that you used sensor but when we check out you suppose to check it before you charge your customer. It seem like you gonna steal their money.
30,1. Self parking lot signs to Mandalay Bay horrible  2. Did mobile check-in and it wouldn't work in the elvator. Spent 22 minutes in line to get a key to work in the elevator  3. Only 3 bath towels in bathroom  4. Food court options close early  5. Too smoky will stay at Park MGM next time
50,we went for a family vacation. had a wonderful time. our group had had several children who also were able to have a great time. even with all the events that were happening the hotel never seemed crowded. The staff was very helpful and friendly. all our rooms clean and well kept.
50,Beautiful hotel casino shops and restaurants. The rooms are beautiful with such comfy beds and the bathroom size is awesome and so important for me!! I love the smell of this hotel and went online and bought the same air freshener!! Great options for pools and entertainment! I could just stay at the hotel and have a great time in Vegas!!
50,Had a great stay at Mandalay Bay hotel and casino in Las Vegas!!!! Staff were exceptionally courteous like always. Rooms were clean and beds super soft and comfortable. The black jack and roulette dealers very friendly and always willing to provide advice on gaming.
50,Mandalay bay continues to be the best overall Casino and resort in Vegas. They have it all from casino shopping dining nightlife and views without the wandering crowds. I finally visited the pool and aquarium - both were fantastic.
30,The tile attached to the bathtub cracked off as well as leaking from what appeared to be the ceiling fan in the bathroom. There were soft/cracked tiles in the bathroom flooring as well which could eventually lead to foot injuries .
40,This was the first time staying here for the wife and i and we really enjoyed the property. The room was comfortable clean and had a nice bathroom. We went to the Lazy River pool every day and also enjoyed floating around and having drinks. Big shout out to Bernice for her smilecheery attitude and positive vibes.GIVE HER A RAISE!. We enjoyed our stay so much that when we were checking out we decided to stay one more night thanks to Mlife and the casino host it was seamless and quick.
10,Had the misfortune of staying here while the hotel was host to a heavy metal festival. The concerts went on out at the pool complex until after 11:00pm every night and were so loud that the windows rattled in our room on the 19th floor!! After this the pot parties started in the hallways and rooms! They didn’t let up until almost 4 am. Security wouldn’t answer the calls downstairs and we got virtually no sleep any of the nights. This was once a great hotel but apparently they are now focused on a the loud heavy metal crowd. I will never stay here again (and I am an Mlife gold member!) as I go on vacation for relaxation and quiet! Avoid at all costs!!
50,Overall stay was quite fantastic. Small annoyances like the bedding being very hot and stuffy. We also did not have any wash cloths in the bathroom but we made due. Room service is a bit overpriced but somewhat understandable as well.
40,Hotel/casino is very clean with excellent amenities. Rooms are on the quiet side compared to other Hotels in Vegas. Friday nights do get noisy in hallways but the other 4 nights were quiet. Casino area has high ceilings and noise and/or smoke was negligible.
50,I had made reservations for Mandalay bay for our 8 year anniversary. The hotel was very nice and clean. Casino was nice. Only thing we had an issue with was housekeeping coming to our room multiple times a day. Our first night housekeeping came to our room at 10pm saying they thought we were checking out that day. Ummm.... we just checked in and weren't leaving for 4 days. The next morning housekeeping knocked on the door at 930am even with our do not disturb sign being out. Other then the housekeeping issue our stay was great.
10,I would never stay here again mold in bathroom Vip experience not worth $200 45 minutes to wait in line at Mlife 1 hour plus wait at check in or out air conditioning was horrible WiFi even worse location is bad getting Uber’s took 15-20 minutes staff not super friendly. Overall unimpressive.
50,We had an amazing time at Mandalay Bay for our wedding and weekend to celebrate highly recommend will be back soon! The rooms were great the staff was so friendly! The only issue we had was the elevators not reading our room keys but it seems like everyone was having that issue!
10,They said they would have someone fix the ac but they couldn't tell me when because it was hotel policy. They said they would leave a card in the room when it was serviced. Two days went by and I finally went to the front desk because there was no card in my room and they said they changed the air filter. That did nothing. There was also mold all over the shower.
50,Great value. Room was beautiful roomy and comfortable. Separate tub and shower convenient double sinks. Staff very friendly and helpful.  The Tran made it easy to get around. Lots of convenient parking.  Only negative would have liked to get coffee earlier than 6:00 AM
30,Everyday we had problems with the valet and with housekeeping. They could never find our car and we had to call housekeeping every day to get hand towels and washcloths because they were never left for us.There were empty hand sanitizer machines all week.
50,We had a 2-bedroom panoramic suite. Great space comfortable beds and almost everything we needed. Would have liked a fridge in the room but overall a great hotel. The beds were very comfortable fitness center was very nice but could use some lighter free weights. Very few complaints - we loved it!!
20,Rooms where not clean and disinfected. Didn’t like the fact that I had to called them 5 times still wasn’t clean . Check out still with rooms dirty. The customer service was not great. Terrible service
20,The positives: slept well comfortable awesome bath tub amazing pools and views of the strip!    The negatives: expensive no free coffee in your room or water the staff are unfriendly and the casino bartenders were borderline hostile! They were coming unwelcoming— if you stay there is a tram that will take you to luxor and excalibur much more fun and friendly casino—- take the sky bridge to MGM grand! It has monorail that can take you to the end of the strip!
10,"Mandalay Bay is declining. Rooms are looking run-down. There was an ice machine flood the weekend I stayed there which resulted in a large noisy fan blowing on it all weekend - not a good look. Room service was horrible. unless you spend $118 you get a "":Grab and Go"" meal which is inedible. Ordered pricey coffee and got 1 CUP. Typically you would get a carafe. The excuse used for the Grab and Go was about COVID but they still require you answer the door and interact with the delivery person - presumably for the gratuity. Charged for parking even though we have MGM Pearl Card . It would not work. The two highlights are as follows 1) the room is quiet. This was built such that you don't hear your neighbors constantly which is refreshing and important. However it was offset by the air conditioning being at a controlled temperature and not working very well - it seemed to be off at night. 2) Housekeeping was awesome. These days you have to ask multiple times for housekeeping and even then frequently don't get it. Housekeeping every day in a great manner without asking. Still will not stay here again."
50,My husband and I both had an awesome time during our stay for the 2 days we were there. The best was the lazy river lockers were available and that the mask mandate was enforced. We also appreciated the tram.
20,We stayed here for 4 days and it was very hot and the ac did not work very well. Also a lot of the employees seem to have a chip on there shoulders i’m not sure why. I will say the rooms are clean and the house keeping is great.
10,We stayed at Mandalay Bay three years previously and couldn’t wait to stay again this year for our five year anniversary. To our disappointment however they had really gone downhill. Multiple elevator keys were broken/missing key fobs were broken or busted off. Warm water at best in the room with minimal water pressure. Bathroom sink was leaking. Entire bottom of dresser detached and fell. Rude/annoyed staff. We paid close to $1000 between two days at Moorea Pool which we had done in the past and had zero problem doing last trip however this trip they had ripped chairs rude staff dirty pools no availability from half their menu because they said so much was broken.    While everything seems so petty or small or possibly pretentious we purposely stay at Mandalay Bay for their amenities and experiences we had in the past however we will not again in the future. It was just a huge let down to our five year anniversary trip knowing we could have stayed somewhere else and had a better time/experience.
30,The hotel is a better option than Luxor and Excalibur but the price is double. The rooms AC did not work great and a few other guests told me the same. The in room service is super high priced and the food is very bland.
50,Very convenient close to airport. Everything under one roof- Food court Entertainment swimming pool is lovely. Ideal for short vacation for families. Local transport is very good. Rooms are very cozy.
20,If you have anyone in your party that is a light sleeper like everyone in familydo not stay here. The toilet and all doors are really loud. You need to pull the doors hard have them click then rattle.
40,So many things to do all in one place! Pool choices spa restaurant choices bands on the weekends many games of choice and stores for shopping. We extended our stay and the staff were incredibly helpful through the whole process.
10,I paid a reservation for a king size bed and me and my girlfriend had to sleep in a queen  I’m a big man 300+ this made my stay uncomfortable. They said I was gonna have a view of the new Raiders Stadium and it was lie . I got a view of the top of the parking lot. Lastly I had reservation with vitamin C infusion shower and aromatherapy… Nope they didn’t have that in my room . I would never stay here again you’re better off at an air bnb
50,Only thing bad is if you get a room that has the mini bar with it make sure you don't accidently knock one of the coffee cups or bottles of water off of the thing they are sitting on cause they will charge you for it because they have some kind of sensor on the stand that they are sitting on that tells the hotel when one has been removed.
30,The checkin was great. Love tgat it was quick and painless. Rooms were simply a room but plumbing noises and ac sounds when it turned on and tv when it turned off were horrible. An incessant alarm was going off somewhere too
30,It could’ve been better the security staff is rude. And the staff overall were making a lot excuses I was given the wrong room and only offered complementary room service which was bland and only offered for one day when I stayed for 2. My room wasn’t serviced with fresh towels the 2nd and they didn’t bring any up when I called down. I expected more and was overall disappointed
20,"I booked a stay for 3 days/2 nights for myself and my girlfriend. Check-in was easy enough but the linen service was ABYSMAL. Not a single time during our stay did we get fresh sheets or towels. I called to the front desk to no avail. Extremely disappointed in one of MGMs ""finest"" establishments."
50,Love staying at Mandalay Bay. Pool staff is very nice and helpful rooms are always clean and with stunning views. I love the large bathroom. Casino is clean and slots will play with you. Easy walk to the strip and TopGolf if you like that sort of thing. Can't wait to go back!
50,Loved the stay here and planning to return next year - Plan to have one day by the multiple pools and rent a cabana. A must if you are looking to relax after walking through all the entertainment close by.
50,We traveled to Las Vegas from California to attend the Michael Jackson show at the stratosphere.We chose Mandalay Bay because it looked more family inviting our daughter is 11 and she accompanied us on this trip although we know Vegas is not necessarily for kids we wanted her to attend the Michael Jackson show with us your hotel was the perfect choice for my family
30,The directions was everywhere. I had to walk so far to my hotel room after parking in the parking lot. It’s 15 dollars for parking. The room was nice and comfy. The hotel was very big and you can go to a pool party downstairs.
50,Stayed here for my birthday! It was a blast! Pool was a lot of fun! Service was great out by the pools. Ice machine was broke on our floor but called and they got ice to us pretty fast. Definitely recommend the VIP experience! Got picked up in a limo and dropped off in a huge SUV.
50,From the moment we arrived at Mandalay Bay I knew the final few days of our summer family vacation was going to be great. The valet was friendly the bell desk at the beginning (and end) were incredibly helpful and the front desk staff were great too.    In addition the room was unbelievably clean and spacious too. The only complaint if I had any and it's not Mandalay Bay's fault -- the location. It's obviously at the extreme end of the Strip. So if you want to visit elsewhere it's pricy. But with an amazing wave pool/pool area amenities etc. - you could easily stay there the entire time and be happy - and the tram to Luxor/Excalibur helps.
30,Mandalay Bay is okay the shower head was very dirty. The view from the 58th floor was nice. The mini bar had missing items which I had to call about to make sure I wasn’t charged for them. My overall stay was okay.
50,Kind of far from everything but you can walk through all the casinos to get down the strip. We had $325 in free play and pretty much won that back in cash. It was an awesome room we stayed in the one bedroom penthouse suite.
50,Loved the wave pool and lazy river at Mandalay Bay. We had a beautiful suite on the 60th floor. Only bad note was the room was the furthest from the elevator. It was a hike each time. At 75 plus I should have requested a room closer but didn’t bother. Other than the 180+ steps to the room I loved everything else. The restaurants were great House of Blues breakfast really delicious and in general our stay was very enjoyable.
10,Was walked into by cleaning service staff with no knocking not once but TWICE. There was hair and dust in the corners of the bathroom/shower. Poor room sound quality. Got no sleep was complained about for noise and got to listen to the tv/phone conversations in the room next to us.
50,This was our second trip in a month. first was a family vacation second was for work. We enjoyed our stay clean rooms and friendly staff I look forward to a return trip. Aside from being at the end of the strip the hotel exceeded all expectations.
20,Ac didn’t work well  Hotel was outdated  Boring casino  The business conference was ok super hot in there as well.  Just overall flat experience considering price and sheer size of this hotel:casino. Unfortunate.
20,"I had such extreme highs and lows during my time there over the past week that it is difficult to give a good score so I settled on 2. The arrival was good yet I do not appear ""rich"" so there were many mixed reactions to requests and issues that arised. One of the biggest low lights for Mandalay was the Shark Reef Aquarium which we visited on the 12th at 5pm. We were rushed through the entrance so I did not have time to request a refund for two tickets so that I could use the two free tickets for being a VIP guest and a Platinum MLife member. Pam a cashier was also very nasty in the gift shop and closed her register as my 3 children and myself were making our purchases. She made a rude comment and then as we checked out with the other cashier she reopened for the people behind us. The cashier we got would not look up my room with my VIP card or give the full 15% discount because my Platinum key still said ""2020"" as I hadn't had time to get a new one from the MLife desk either. My daughters told me that Pam also glared at me and spoke under her breath about me as she passed by me later. I do not know what I did to Pam to cause any of that. There were also issues with the room cleanliness and some maintenance issues like the shower drain being severely clogged the sheets being dirty the windows having lip and hand prints and the light being out in the toilet area. Most of the staff at Mandalay Beach was great including Johnathan Paulina and Amber at the beach cabana but others were rude and terrible when I asked questions in passing. Also I was never asked if I wanted anything while gambling on the casino floor. I had to approach a server and I am almost 100% sure that an issue arose while using my Freeplay from one machine to another but while I asked for help several times from Elizabeth I was still not given any explanation on how I had $217 in Freeplay when leaving one machine and then $0 when I began to play on the next. I checked the balance before I left that machine. So I felt strongly that my tattooed and pierced appearance with no makeup or jewelry had a definite impact on the level of assistance I received on the casino floor. Overall like I said things were either great or AWFUL."
50,I had a lovely time felt good can’t wait to vist again soon Great service outstanding communication I really enjoyed myself Time well spent No complaints.. I will definitely com back again . Very happy
30,Free is not completely free. I still got charged almost 45 dollars per day on resort fees. Apparently you need gamble a whole lot more at MGM properties than Caesars to get the resort fee comped. I feel somebody should have reviewed my play.
50,Is a must to stay again everything about it was top notch  So many pool preferences available  Anything you need want was available and the strip was not far at all  My family will be back again guaranteed
40,I love this hotel we have been here many times  In particular time we had a very disappointed customer service at the pool we did our reservations foe 2 chairs and an umbrella online got checked in by a nice lady while trying to enjoy our time we got approached by one male employee in a very rude disrespectful and unprofessional way telling us that these chairs are not just to be there that we need to reserve theme I tried to explain that we dis and that I’ve been here for a couple of hours already they he replied on a very mocking tone ah now you have to pay I then told him we already paid he said no I’ve been here all day and you didn’t check in with me.  We of course pay for the chairs and check in with a different person all he said well I’m sort but I have to deal with people that don’t want robot for the chairs all day long
10,Tried to check in at 3:00 5:00 and 8:00 pm finally got checked in. Walked through the door of the room and they had a fog machine in the middle of the room chemicals filled the room. Looks like someone was very sick in room carpet was soaked and you could see stains everywhere looks like they tried to clean carpets and they were still soak and wet. They said they could downgrade our room and would remove the resort fees but they were not removed after checkout.
10,I’m borrowed of bugs and this is why I always search for the 4 star hotels/resorts. This time I chose Mandalay Bay and I’m disgusted! There was a roach crawling on the ceiling and then it fell onto the bed. I immediately called guest services the attendant didn’t sound like she cared at all. She sent one of the custodians to get the bug out of the room and moved me to a different room. I had to pack up my all of my luggage and move by myself they didn’t offer to send a bellsman to help me move and the digital key didn’t work when I got to the room. So I then had to go to the front desk wait in line re explain my situation and who I was and then got my $60 room service bill comped. That was the remedy and no one seemed to care that roaches were crawling on my bed on my persona belongings and I will never go there where I’m not comfortable.
10,This was the saddest trip ever to Vegas. This hotel does not care about you. They just care about the money. No places to eat after 11pm nor before 3pm. Food way over priced. Its a 2 star not a 4 star rated. Lights go out in the room. Blackjack dealer are slow and they didnt let you have .
50,Mandalay Bay locates in the heart of Vegas strip and walking distance to several nearby hotels thru indoor pass. It is also accessible to convention center. MGM hotel chains are also connected by monorail which runs every 20-40 mins.
30,Disappointing and run down. Rooms too warm limited to one towel at pool (so much for lying and drying). For a 5 day stay housekeeping does not allow a fresh hand towel (only 1 in room) or a 2nd bar of shower soap…. 10 people/5 rooms in our group were all disappointed. Ri Ra food blah but Strip Steak was excellent. Bottom line none of us will be staying there again.
10,We received our room after waiting four hours to get it clean and it was still gross. Paid a lot for the 2 bedroom suite (1480 square feet) and it was filthy. Tables dirty used masks on the floor mold in the bathrooms and the floor near the toilet stunk of urine.
50,Went to watch a football 🏈 game and stayed here !! It was perfect!! This is the location you have to stay at to see events at the stadium!! Just a hop and skip away !! Clean and awesome pool and beach areas
20,VIP experience was huge waste of 250$ no express check in lounge closes pretty early staff didn't really care that I paid extra for these things and couldn't even use them the day we arrived. Security is rude no attractions or shows at the resort except shark reef. Have to travel down into strip for the shows and attractions only thing useful was the tram to get you all the way to Excalibur without walking. If you have a concern or want to try and find someone to talk to Goodluck even the phone in our room took almost 10 minutes to get a hold of someone.
30,We were assigned a room and when we used the key card the previous guests luggage and briefcase was still there. Yikes SECURITY!!! The lamp by the bed is the only place to plug in your iPhone but YOU CANNOT because your charging block falls out! So you have to unplug the lamp to have an outlet. Your choice; phone charged or wham your toe on the furniture in the dark. Also if you like to choose your room temp below 72 good luck! It’s a warm night sleeping. Oh and my faucet was at a slow drip. So finally day 2 I took off the drain filter cleaned it and viola’! perfect faucet flow. I mean the flow was like 1 ounce per hour. Last the location is really not in walking distance of any other major casinos or shows so budget $40-$50 per night for cabs to more known locations.
20,Prices on basic items such as water were very expensive. We paid 6 dollars for a small bottle. Room service came to over $100 for wings a soup & a quesadilla - no drinks ....Our room was very very hot AC did not work properly. Cabanas were going for $650 +. No free parking  valet was $30. Overall the cost was high which almost took the fun out of visiting Las Vegas.
50,We really love staying here. The rooms are so large nicely decorated clean and the beds are so comfy you don't want to get up in the morning. The staff is fantastic and very helpful when you have a question or need help locating something. Highly recommend.
10,We had problems with every aspect of this hotel. Check in failed. Bell Desk failed. Housekeeping failed. The service at the restaurants and by the pool was terrible at best. We stayed at other hotels during this same trip with none of these issues. We've stayed here many times before and this trip proved to us why we will never stay here again.
50,Mandalay is the only property left in the cluster of south strip that still has an aura of class to them MGM is rapidly approaching Circus Circus and Excaliber with all he ambiance of an East L.A. ghetto.
50,Overall Very Satisfied with stay. You basically have everything to do their. Plenty of dinning options as well as shops pools and tons of gaming options. Only issue we had during our stay is that the A/C was down to 65fh and felt like 75ish. 12th floor.
30,The feeling of average was everywhere. We were excited about the electronic room key but it rarely worked. That caused a few missed elevator trips and a delayed entry into our room.    The Sea Breeze felt like a school cafeteria and the food quality was not impressive. We understand everyone is trying to get back to normal but this is Vegas and it is competitive. I visited several years ago and was impressed. It has gone down a couple of notches. So I really didn’t impress my wife.
40,Beautiful hotel very comfortable beds and extremely clean. Guest service was very informative and just the overall appearance was amazing! Love the connection between Mandalay and Luxor. Spa services was phenomenal!
30,Price was reasonable but they didn't accommodate our request to be with another family traveling with us which made our stay significantly more difficult. TV was broken and technician did not come to repair
40,We were able to have direct access to allegiant stadium from our hotel without having to get into a vehicle. That alone made it worth it. Unfortunately our room was not cleaned daily not sure why. That was the one part that really bothered me. With the amount of money that we paid to stay at the hotel one would think that the rooms would be cleaned each day and for some reason they wouldn’t come until four or 5 PM after we had been out all day and if we were in the room and asked them to return in a few minutes so we could change clothes they never returned at all. But other than that everything was great. The VIP check-in was amazing and our limo drivers were able to get us to and from the airport without any issue. It was actually the smoothest check in and check out I’ve ever had at a hotel.
20,Upon arriving at approx 1:00 pm on Saturday 8/14/21 you couldn't access the Parking Garage because it was completely blocked off because of the Raider football game which was scheduled for 6:00 pm. I had go off the hotel grounds and take the perimeter service streets that I'm not familiar with to get completely around to the opposite side of the property to gain access to the garage. By the way the streets were hectic because of the game. After finally parking I took the elevator down to the hotel entrance but when I got there the entrance was completely blocked off because of construction. There were no signs or any Mandalay employees to direct us where to go. I had to walk over to the Delano hotel and they gave me directions. There were at 10 other people there who didn't know where to go.    Then like I needed another headache checking in became a challenge. The gal at check-in desk wasn't helpful. I finally spoke to a manger who got me a room that wasn't a 1/2 mile from the elevator.    I've been staying here for over 20 years and have never dealt with anything like this. I won't be going anywhere near Mandalay when there's a Raider game. Oh and the Raider fans in the hotel prior to the game were just absolutely obnoxious screaming and hollering. I couldn't wait to leave. I checked out at 8:45 am Sunday morning.
30,If you are coming to a game by all means stay here. Getting a taxi will be impossible as will trying to park here. Stay and walk over. Pool furnishing is outdated and no great restaurants to speak of. Walls were paper thin and we heard the baby next door cry all night long 3/5 nights.    A/c never cooled down the room - we were overlooking the stadium and I think the sun was just too hot on the windows.
40,Could be c 19 related but waitress frequency or staffed short. Otherwise great all around resort/casino. One of the more spread out and spacious casinos. Quick access to everything with in the casino and staff is very accommodating.
20,Awful service and scammed by another customer at the pool and put charges for cocktails on our friends room number. He was a total con artist and took of our friends credit card it’s an absolute disgrace and the charges of 500 needs to be removed
50,After a long Covid break we felt ok to venture back to Vegas after getting our vaccines. Mandalay bay was great. service at check-in was great and easy. Rooms were clean and the pool areas were a good escape from the warm temperatures.  Back soon
40,Depending on plans location could be issue because located at end of strip - but close to airport; very nice room and amenities; wifi included; there is a fridge but a $50 fee to use for personal items.
50,Great stay easy self park quick help finding check in desk the hardest thing was picking a restaurant to eat at as they were all good with the Sea Breeze as my number one pick for breakfast great food and excellent service great room and amenities
50,It was a great trip and I felt safe the entire time. The staff did a great job enforcing mask expectations at tables and throughout the property. I would come back to Mandalay for another visit. This was my 4th time staying at this MGM property.
50,Fun with the family. Lots to do. My 16 year old thought he would be bored but found out there are plenty of activities. Make sure to take a trip the the Grand Canyon by helicopter if possible. Amazing views. One of my favorite things I have ever done.
40,Chose the Mandalay because our daughter would be with us and we wanted to enjoy the pools and lazy river. We stayed 3 nights 4 days and never left the property. Restaurants pool shopping etc. provided everything we needed just like casinos intend. Beds are not super comfy and no microwave in the room but everything else was excellent. Really nice full bathroom with soaking tub was a plus.
10,Booked two rooms for myself and family. One room wasn’t ready until almost 9:00pm. Rooms never cooled comfortably. Had to buy two box fans to be able to sleep without sweating to death. Weather was super hot but other hotels we visited for shows and entertainment did not have this problem. Rooms did not appear to be vacuumed/swept. Ice machine was broken the entire time and had to almost argue with “guest services” to get ice brought to our rooms. Only positive was that the Bell Desk and Valet staff were always helpful and friendly.
10,Let’s get to the negatives the shower was disgusting the shower head had green moldmildew all over it WiFi was non existent even though you have to pay a daily fee to use it all In all it sucked overpriced and overhyped look to stay somewhere else.
10,We booked a “Resort King” room for 3 nights. When we checked in they put us in a Resort Queen room saying that the room type we booked was “Resort” and the bed size was just a preference. Because we arrived in the late evening they had given out the king beds to earlier arrivals. They said we had to take the queen room instead since they didn’t guarantee room types.    I looked on their website and showed them that the website was still offering “Resort King” rooms for the 3 nights we had booked and their response was that it didn’t matter. If I pushed the “Book Now” button right there they would still give us a queen room.    The manager said I could try again tomorrow and maybe they could get us a King bed but no promises.    I’ve averaged 180 hotel nights per year for the past 2 decades and have never been to a property that so casually dismissed their guests booked room reservation.    Don’t fall for the Mandalay Bay Resorts deceptive booking practices. What you select and pay for doesn’t matter to them and they’ll give you whatever room they choose. Don’t give them your business.
40,My son enjoyed the pools especially wave pool.  bring tour own tube or buy for lazy river.  They have pool party on Saturday until 11pm with quite loud music hard to get sleep before that stops. Room size is great !
50,Just an overall amazing experience. We were well taken care of. Any and all of our questions the staff definitely had an answer for it all. I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone. Plus the amazing location right next to all of the nearby action can’t be overlooked. Mandalay Bay made us feel like we didn’t even need to leave for anything else.
30,Ok. Let me start with the good. Melissa at check in was a doll. Our room Delano corner room stay well suite nice! View fantastic. The Bad: long ass hike from your room to anywhere in the casino. Opened mini fridge hubby picked up bottle of Tito’s because we thought we might purchase to make a drink. Decided against it put it back down. FYI: anything you touch you have purchased basically. I called front desk to discuss the $11 charge. Bernadette stated that at 5.:27pm a bag of M&Ms was removed from mini fridge. Well. That is incorrect. I disputed it. The answer to this was someone would come do inventory. I doubt the $11 will be removed from my bill. I said well then I prob should take those $11 M&M’s. Bernadette didn’t find that funny. Here’s a thought Mandalay Bay……….post this info clearly on the mini bar fridge and maybe at check in you should inform your guests about this. Who knew it was weighted and if you touch something and it’s removed for more than 20 seconds. Party is over. Just my 2 cents.
50,Awesome and caring service the whole time we were there!! Check in with mobile app. was so-so for and since I am not that computer savvy I waited in line but that didn't take long. The cabana staff was excellent and very attentive!! Thumbs up for sure.
40,Guests services was phenomenal and the hotel establishment was worth the money. Only complaints were from the casino. Slots were super tight and dealers and drink staff seemed bothered to be working. Not a good vibe. Stay at Mandalay but play somewhere else!
40,We did a double hotel stay letting the boys choose a hotel each. One chose the Mandalay and the other chose Planet Hollywood. Switching hotels only took an hour max so not too much trouble.    Pro's the hotel is huge looks modern rooms a very good and the hotel ameneties are great also. The pool area looks great but does get very busy and unless you get down early you may struggle for a sunbed. The casino is great lots of modern slots and tables and some good restaurants.    As with all hotels in Vegas they let themselves down by charging you taxes and then completely ripping you off for food and bevereges. $27 for an alcoholic slush by the pool area..... you might laugh but actually you want to get angry with them. Would we stay here again possibly if other hotels weren't available.
50,The wave pool/beach/lazy river is perfect for a summer get away and worth it to stay at the end of the strip in the summer. In the winter I would stay more mid-strip. We had a great time (my husband my 10 yo daughter and I).
20,My room was dirty upon arrival and was not offered another room. The front dest was called they just sent someone to clean it instead of offering me another room and the bath tub was dirty as well. I feel another room should have been offered since it was cleaned. I checked in late in the evening so there was no reason for my room to be not clean
50,We have stayed at Mandalay Bay many many times and everytime    has been always good. We like the location and restaurants and near other casinos. variety of machines to play and bars it's pleasant atmostphere. We have always had good memories there
50,Great service and spacious room. Elite King Suite. Pools were nice  I didn't consider the Mandalay for many years because of is location but I can tell you it's well worth it. The rooms are clean and well decorated. Its a really good value.
50,I visited Mandalay for a 4 day business trip just before lockdown. My days were full on and by night I was full on! Managed to get a swim in hotel pool played my $25 in seconds in hotel casino walked the strip enjoyed Bellagio water fountain and my room directly overlooking strip so slept with curtains open and watched the world party 24/7.  Hotel had everything I needed great choice of foods and entertainment.  Clean and staff helpful.
50,"It's a Great property to stay in MGM Properties. enjoy the pools beach Staff. If you're not gamble. Otherwise u will have a least one fight (verbal fighting) with ridiculously male asian floor managers in MB Casino. Because They are in that ""ready to fight"" mode at all times"
10,My Stay was nothing less than a nightmare. I had 2 washrags my entire 4 day stay with 2 children. The phone in my room did not work properly so anytime I called the front desk for something it was a struggle just to ask for something. $30 for valet parking was a complete joke! I waited 45 min just to get my car and over 25 just to park in valet. This was a huge disappointment as this me and my kids very first trip to Las Vegas!
50,First time staying there. Great hotel very clean and the rooms were awesome. We reserved a cheap king room and it was huge! Even had a view of the strip which typically are more expensive. The bed was super comfy too.
50,Loved the pool! my kids and I spent hours at the pool and the food was delicious. The casino is clean and staff friendly. It is a bit away from the main strip but enjoyed the exercise. Would definitely stay here again.
30,I had Several negative issues in one night stay that greatly disappointed me with your Hotel this weekend.  #1 My Digital key did not work in the elevator so I couldn't get to my room upon arrival had to wait in line at the desk anyways after completing all of the mobile check in to get a physical key after traveling stuck in the elevator to the top floor and back down unable to press the button for my floor.  #2 When I finally did get into my room hot and sweaty from the 106 degree weather I needed a shower and get dressed to meet friends for dinner... The Shower knob was laying in the floor water was dripping in the shower and therefore I was unable to shower... I even tried to replace it myself to no avail. When I called the front desk - it took almost 20 MINS to get an answer only to be told someone would come up to fix it but they had no idea how long it would be! SO ... I sponged bathed myself from the bathtub and left to get dinner... While at dinner I received a phone call from the Hotel Sevy he tells me that Maintenance was unable to repair the shower it was actually a room that was having water issues and should NEVER have been booked to begin with so they have to move me to another room. .. WOW .. The person I talked to was Sevy who apologized for the issue offered me a $50 Room/or food & beverage credit for the inconvenience... I appreciated this but also requested that I be given a late check out the next day for all of my inconvenience and he agreed to grant me a 3pm checkout.  #3 - When I returned from dinner - I had to stop at the front desk ... WAIT IN LINE AGAIN to get the new key to the new room to MOVE my stuff...  #4 - When I got to my new room - Finally able to take a shower ... I found a HUGE ball of HAIR in the drain!! Ugh! I was so disgusted and so tired and upset I stood in the shower with my feet away from the drain & hair .. after taking a photo for proof and then just went to bed.  #5 - I spent a wonderful day at the Beach / Pool with my friends where I charged my drinks to the room to gratefully use the $50 Credit I was promised by Sevy for the previous night's fiasco.... BUT that afternoon when I went to check out .. there was NO CREDIT on my account... So .... I had to go to the Front desk AGAIN and WAIT in LINE AGAIN to get this corrected... An employee helped me with this checked with a Manager who authorized again the $50 credit at this point I'm thinking my whole night should have been fully Comped...
50,great service wverything was great i had so much fun. my family loved it. defenwntly will recomwnd to family and to friends. i look foward to going back. i will defenetly go back again. it was a great time!
10,I am local and stay all across the strip nearly every month. I got the Elite King and it cost me 700 bucks for two nights sunday-tuesday. This is the worst place even worse than the luxor and im not even joking. I stayed in the Cosmo for the same price and had a suite twice as big. The fridge in your room isn't a fridge its a minibar that if you open it will shake the contents and you'll get charged. I opened mine once to see if it was a normal fridge and closed it and it locked lol. The room service prices are more expensive than anywhere I have stayed (like what?). Uncomfortable bed.Long waits for check in. Shark reef is a scam because its miniscule (just go to bass pro shops for the same vibe). Water costs at least 5 bucks a bottle so bring some or enjoy the sink. It costs 9 dollars to get room service which doesn't go to any employee just the hotel then you do gratuity on top.Even the view sucks unless you enjoy seeing the airport or the highway. Stay anywhere else and get a better bang for buck. I will never stay here again and I will warn everyone the same.Mlife is a joke in itself and I hate to bring it up again but cosmopolitans loyalty card is eons better. Literally forget this place.
20,The first room smelled bad shower didn't drain. Second room made some sounds from sink which didn't let us sleep well. Third room was good when i upgraded to a better type of room. We spoke with several people at the front desk about the problems we were experiencing only one was actually trying to help.
30,The Strip View is ok but because the drop area is right below my window and ways away from the main strip. I did have much of a view high recommend the beach view and going to the pool party if you can.
10,Come to this hotel if you want to be overcharged for subpar service. Don’t book the cabana unless you want to be pressured to vacate T around 2pm. The only reason to visit this hotel is to eat at Ri Ra Irish Pub.
10,Dusty Hill (Can’t believe we share the same last name) the pit boss is a bigot. He called the floor manager to have me kicked off the only craps table around 4AM. Danny the floor manager said that I was being too “pushy” with my bets. Keep in mind I was the only person on the table. Danny offered to buy me breakfast (never did) if I left so I proceeded to cash out my chips. While in line at the cashier Dusty called security and had them harass me for my id and room number. That apparently flagged my room number a last and final warning and basically MADE me go to my room with like four security guards. Never once cursed raised my voice nor was I a threat to anyone or myself. Just a young black man literally by himself lol.    I stayed there three nights ate at their restaurants gambled and bought a cabana on Sunday. When I checked out and wanted to complain to a manager they would only direct me to security and said they’re not sure how long they would be.    Not only that my wife and her best friend saw rats (yes rodent’s) twice on the casino floor. Disgusting cleanliness and service all around. Sad as an Mlife gold member I’m considering not giving any MGM establishment any of my money or recommendations anymore.
30,Went for a friends birthday. Room housekeeping was ok. Slow delivery of towels. Check in and out was easy. Pools were awesome definitely rent a cabana or gazebo!! Not a lot of shade. Tram was quick to other hotels.
50,This resort was beautiful! Check in was extremely easy with the online check in option. We were even able to get digital keys to our room from our phone. The resort also sent a text when our room was available. Our flight arrived at 10 am and our room was ready at 10:15z Staff was friendly and kind. Rooms were clean. Pool was amazing! Will definitely be back!
20,I came to Vegas for the first time expecting to have the trip of a lifetime but it started out horrible. I paid for the VIP experience but it was anything but that. I was greeted at the airport by a Men in Black driver that I had to search for and this is after the transportation person on the phone said to meet him by Starbucks. Keep in mind the airport has more than one Starbucks. The driver looked at me like pure garbage and acted more like a FBI agent than a VIP driver. He questioned me about being me as if I wasn’t good enough to be receiving the service. (Possibly because I am black) He drove with so much speed that we probably arrived at the hotel in 5 minutes. Upon checking in I asked to cancel my VIP ride scheduled for checkout because I would rather catch a cab than pay for VIP and get treated like dirt . After checking in and going to my room I returned to the desk to ask for a different room because I didn’t like the view. The very pleasant and understanding agent changed my room and upgraded me to a Stay Well room for the hearing impaired👀This is all after flying for over 6 hours so I proceeded to full the tub and take a warm bath to relax my mind. When letting the bath water out the tub there was hair all over me. Gross. Needless to say I rinsed the hair off feeling disgusting and totally disappointed. At this point I was tired of going to the desk so I went to dinner and retired for the night. When I woke up the following morning and went to use the bathroom I realized there was hair in every corner of the bathroom. I still don’t understand this because I would imagine with Covid etc a hotel of this magnitude would take better care to clean their rooms. I returned to the desk and complained only to given a $100 food credit. Can this cover the potential germs that I might have picked up from the previous guest hair not to mention the constant itching …… I am visiting on Business and planned to return along with recommending this hotel to my company’s 15 other buyers but at this point I don’t see that happening.
20,Stayed in an old room. Faded chairs dirty beds old crusty towels and mold in the shower. The bathtub still had water in it from previous guest. I've stayed here before and had a nicer updated room so I was very disappointed.
50,My wife and I had a great stay with excellent service from everyone. The complimentary room was great with a great view of a part of a roof? But that was okay with us. We were only in the room for 3 hours to sleep until we could catch our flight super early in the morning.
20,We have been to Vegas a few times now this was our first time at Mandalay Bay and would not stay there again. Downstairs bathroom were always dirty room ac didn’t work good at all impossible to get a drink while playing machines and no free coffee in the rooms. You could not use the fridge to keep leftovers cold unless you wanted to pay $50 to store your stuff in their fridge. Meals were average We spent a lot of money and next time we won’t stay there.
40,The hotel was nice and clean. I stayed in the Moorea Suite. We had a blast house cleaning was great. The suite was like the pictures and the bed was amazing for rest. The pool is packed so splurge for the Moorea beach area if you can for relaxation. The casino was nice and always accessible. The restaurants in the Mandalay Bay was great. The ice bar was a great experience. Overall I would stay again.
30,Ada room bed was too high ac wasn’t cooling below 75 hot charged for coffee I didn’t use in room room never got cleaned no Ada parking had to park on Delano side and not at Mandalay resort parking because it was full .
50,Staff was very helpful and respectful. Hotel was clean! I’ve stayed in about 6 or 7 different mgm hotels on the strip. The Mandalay has been the nicest so far. Although I took a hit at the tables I had a great time!
40,Overall we had a great time at Mandalay Bay. Room was very clean and spacious. Many attractions for everyone. My kids loved the wave pool. Friendly staffs all around. Front desk was superb that got us in checked in quickly. The only bad experience we had was the room service. Food quality was very poor for being a top notch Vegas resort.
20,The parking garage was a joke. They had the entrance from garage to Mandalay Bay closed. elevators were not working except for the 2 in the back of garage. The escalator in garage was not working in one section the entire time we were there. When we checked in our first room had brown stains on sheets. we were moved to a different room that was better but not very clean. They gave us 3 bath towels and no wash cloths or hand towels for 4 days so we had to ask for more towels. The casino was not very clean. Overall a big disappointment for us. We used to love staying here but no more. Next time we are staying strictly at our time share..
50,This hotel has great food good entertainment and the rooms are wonderful. I’m really hard on hotels when it comes to cleanliness.. I clean all of the common items and areas and there is usually lots of dust and dirt like you wouldn’t believe( even in the really expensive hotels) as I cleaned certain items in this room it was surprisingly already clean and dust free.. I love it!!
50,Fun relaxing and did not feel crowded. Pools were perfect for my family. The staff helped get us a great value for the stay. When needing to get to the airport the staff made it happen rapidly which relieved alot of stress. Mandalay Bay is a 10 out of 10
40,my stay was not bad i enjoyed the beach  bar and grill area not that good food not that good and very expensive  no special service  hotel is beautiful  self parking is far from mandaly hotel it was at delano other property . i give it totally not bad  rooms was clean and good view . with the season the room was expensive than other caesars property.lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
30,No coffee or fridge this is bare minimum for less expensive hotels. We were scared to touch the fridge for fear of a $50 charge if it was used. Toilet was dirty like vomit under of bowl. We had a good time. The Noodle restaurant was not good at all. Food court closed very early. Strip steak restaurant was good. Overall the pools are all they have exceptional to offer.
40,The staff bar service and cleaning staff were all pleasant and very helpful. However the hotel charges for every little thing example $10 generic k-cup coffee in the mini bar. Mini bar bills ended up charged to the room that were never made. Drunk people in the halls at 2am are to be expected.
50,I called Bell the Receptionist Service to send someone to my room and remove water and bar drinks because my husband has memory issues and I did not want him accidentally remove or touch the drinks in the little fridge I called three times and waited four hours and no one came to the room to remove or locked the fridge as promised by the receptionist who received my call.
30,Just not as welcoming as I remember and property needed some repairs. Rome refrigerator wouldnt open bathroom doors stuck wave pool staff on Aug 5 2021 got in a confrontation with a family that took 3 other staff to come and eventually move the staff.
30,We chose Mandalay Bay for the pools and it did not disappoint. We went down around 8 am when they opened and it was not crowded until we left around 10 am. Make sure you bring your own tube for the lazy river.    The check in process was slow and frustrating! I paid for early check in for 11:00 am and we did not get a room until 1:30 pm. We were refunded the early check in fee but it was annoying walking around with our luggage. We killed time by eating at the very overpriced food court. The walkway from the parking garage through the restaurants to get to the casino and lobby was crowded and under renovation. The check in lines were long and I heard other people complaining about house keeping. They are probably understaffed due to COVID.    The rooms were spacious large bathroom very clean. The AC took awhile to cool the room down.    In general the hotel did not have as much of a fun feeling as the others we checked out like the Mirage and Venetian. Although the pool area was nice I would not stay here again.
50,We stay at the Mandalay Bay resort all the time and this trip was no different than the others. We did get to eat at the Foundation Room which is a must for anyone new to the property. The views are amazing and the food is very good.
10,Parking blocked off for soccer event. It took one hour to park. Elevators shut down in parking garage and one section of the escalator was broken. As a guest I paid $15.00 to park in Mandalay's parking garage. Rude staff.
30,Was expecting a lot more for the cost. My advice go to the Mirage. Save money at the Mirage with better service and location.    Good trip all and all. Family enjoyed themselves and shows were decent..
30,Everything was good but the pool. It was an mainly for adults. My kids 3 and 7 were disappointed. Pool had cans of beer. Rooms were comfortable but nothing compare for I had signed for. Towels had a weird smell. I don't think housekeeping changed them on our 2nd day. Overall good experience except the swimming pool experience 🤔👎 for kids. I think the four seasons next to this hotel pool was better for the most prominent.
10,I know there may be staffing issues these days but rooms were not cleaned /replenished very well daily during my 4 night stay. Tried calling for service and concierge a few times and got no answer after several calls. Not the great service
10,I traveled with my spouse and 19 month old. We stayed in the King Premium Suite for 5 nights. We’re M Life Platinum now so we get free valet so we valeted our car almost every time.  Valet- so efficient. Drop off is upstairs on the casino level. The staff is quick to get you in and out AND 9/10 times they were very friendly. Pick up is downstairs on the pool level. The guys bringing the cars were 9/10 times not friendly.. which is crazy because I’m literally tipping you out every time. We watched one guy whip a turn so hard with our car that he almost hit another guest. But for the most part they brought our car fairly quickly.  Self park- I self parked once so that I could let you all know in my review how efficient it was. You also get free self parking if you’re an m life pearl or above member. Anyways the rear elevators are broken on every floor. That was a bummer because I had a stroller. Middle escalators also broken. Right by the parking lot exit on the 4th floor there is another elevator. It comes out by the ride share area and Delano valet. So if you’re staying in the Delano the self parking structure is convenient. For those staying in Mandalay you need to walk a bit to get to the hotel. Then you enter through a service entrance by Stripsteak and Starbucks. Which is A WALK to get to the lobby elevators.  Check in was easy- separate VIP counter for m life reward members. The check in customer service was lacking considering.  ELEVATORS- SUCK.To get up to your room you need your key. Which will work 50% of the time in the elevator. Sometimes you need to scan your card on the opposite card reader or get off and try another elevator.  Room- beautiful decor. Big space. No tech amenities like in the Aria or Vdara. Manual window treatments. Weird duct tape lining the windows to hide the wires?  Safety- every night some weirdo knocked on our door. Drunkards. One incident where a woman tried to enter our room. After telling her to leave she proceeded to get undressed by my door and continue to knock. Needed to contact guest services (20min on hold) so they could call security.  Room service- food sucks. So expensive. Food was horrible. “Table service” is a ghetto table they roll in thats too high to use with any chair or bed in the room. Also ice machine was broken so room service needs to deliver to you (45min-1hr wait)  Pool- didn’t use because it was too hot and too crowded. Looked nice though.  Overall wouldn’t stay there again.
10,Stay here if you don’t want to sleep and experience a free concert and night club from your very own hotel room and want to talk to staff that are completely rude and dismissive. Oh and the WiFi is horrible and you have to cell signal so good luck entertaining yourself until 4am when the madness finally ends. Pretty fun when you have to get up at 6:30a for a work conference. I hate Vegas.
20,Very expensive staff friendly ac broken in room housekeeping came into room twice even though we had requested no one enter room. Pool closed early for concert but no communication about this. Pool is nice but very crowded.
50,"The hotel is a top notch facility. Although it is south if most of the action on the strip the wave pool lazy river and other pools make it an ideal location for a summer getaway. The property features an amazing restaurant known as the Sea Breeze Cafe (although COVID has killed their famous ""bottomless bloody mary"") Service is excellent and the casino is great."
40,Solid venue for medium to large conferences . Downside is location. Everything else on the strip is a cab ride. Quiet and clean rooms. Check in and check out pretty efficient. Staff is friendly and helpful.
50,They provide excellent costumer device the room was super clean the bar service was super.The valet parking great service and very helpful to find the places to eat and have a good drink. The pool was fun for my son.
50,We decide to chose this hotel for being great on reviews and specially for the pools…did not disappoint with anything and my whole family (which we were a big group of 20+ people) overall great vacation and will do it again for sure
30,Stay wasn’t bad service was lacking we had issues with housekeeping and not being able to get a do not disturb or refuse cleaning service tag was annoying. Having a pint glass of urine outside our door wasn’t not awesome either
50,"Great restaurants fun atmosphere Clean and remarkably quite The grounds are kept in a clean and tidy manner everyone was friendly and helpful A reminder if you do use ""uber"" there are designated pick up areas."
50,Pools and Rooms are some of the best Vegas has to offer. Overcrowded at pools and elevators but overall good stay at Mandalay Bay. M Life should offer better rates pretty close to Expedia. First time at Mandalay Bay.
20,not worth the money ; too far away from the center of strip ; long wait queue for check in or changes ; did not get connecting rooms ; no complimentary gifts / condiments from the hotel ; unnecessarily charged for unused items ; disgusting state of shower curtains ; no option of late check out
20,Wifi was horrible! I persistently pointed it out to a staff that didn't show they cared at all...they just kept blowing me off! Finally after multiple calls they sent in work order and learned the internet service provider's equipment was causing issues for the entire hotel. Also room keys don't work when entering//exiting parking garage and other areas. Too many technical issues....I get problems happen but listen to your paying guests! I Expected much better from Mandalay Bay!
30,Mandalay needs definite upgrading and the room was just ok. Make sure if reserving a cabana by the pool that you double check you are actually reserving a cabana and not a day bed. The wording is very misleading on the website. Def are better and more updated hotels to stay at on the strip. If you are stayting with kids I think they lump everyone who has kids on the same floors. it was noisy and rooms are not great. Def seems like they give the lesser rooms to people traveling with kids.
50,Great customer service at front desk quick check in. Person at front desk upgraded my room to a beautiful suit for the same price. We we're fully satisfied with our suit and view from our suit's window.
10,We changed rooms 6 times due to the rooms being filthy. The manager was very rude over the phone and did nothing to help us. Had I not been so tired from gravel we would have checked out and went elsewhere. There were blood stains on the beds and bedding food stuck to the mattress. It was absolutely disgusting. I will never ever stay here again.
30,Ac was not working. The maintenance guy came at 11pm to fix it and said the vent was clogged he changed it but it still was not working. Came on a weekend when it was 113 outside. The tv keep glitching turning off and on. The only thing I liked was the lazy river.
40,Mandalay Bay as always been a great go-to for staying in Las Vegas. The rooms are comfortable and the hotel smells great when you walk in. While they allow smoking in the casino you can't smell it because of the great air filtration and they put rose water into the a/c so it has a light rose perfume smell as well. Currently masks a required in all buildings and they supplied all guests with masks and hand sanitizer to help them comply with Nevada's recent mask mandate.
30,My overall review I rate is okay  the pool was very nice but the room itself was not to my liking . The shower had a foul smell from the pipes  the tub was dirty there was no hand towels on first night . They charge for a refrigerator to put your stuff in  and there’s no microwave  the phone was so statically you can barely hear them . The bed is very comfortable that’s pretty much it .
50,Overall my stay at Mandalay bay was wonderful. It was a great experience with my family. The best pools Ive experienced thus far. Ive stayed in 3 other hotels on Las Vegas strip. All staff were polite and helpful. Guest services was accommodating with room change. Everyone was very attentive. I am very satisfied with my stay.
50,Check in was a little long but once at the front of the line things went smoothly. My room was lovely and very comfortable...bed divine...slept like a baby. Dining venues very good. Casino large and not crowded.
20,The wait for the elevators at checkout time was way too long. The shower faucet handle fell off when I touched it luckily it didn't land on my foot. There were no hand towels. The bathtub faucet was leaking.
20,Old casino. Food terrible. Expensive. Tired employees. High bet minimum. Drinks hard to get. Reservations desk will tell you something that is not true and will eventually cost you more. Long waits for cars.
50,I have not been to Las Vages since Jan 2020 due to Covid-19. At the Begining i was woried. The hotel was in great shape. our room was great we had a great view of the strip. And most of all the staff were on top of thier game and consistatly cleaning and sanitizing the palce. I will definatly go back.
50,Went for business and ended up having an amazing time. They actually have an entire beach complete with wave pool and lazy river. The employees were extremely helpful and friendly. The food at the beach is amazing. The Southern Breakfast Bowl ended up being the best breakfast that I’ve had in years. So good I had to ask the Chef’s name. Great food Chef O’Neill! I’m definitely coming back with my family.
40,Mandalay Bay had a lot of construction more than usual and it made the walk from the garage to the room appear to be a bit much for my mother who was visiting for the first time. Also restaurants closed earlier than expected so if you did not eat early there were no late night options at Mandalay Bay it was frustrating one night and we were happy that we had snacks.
40,The hotel was not as clean as I would have expected it to be. In fact I would have thought it to be a lot cleaner than prior years’ visits— considering we are still midst pandemic. Therefore although I had a good stay I feel that it wasn’t at the above average standards of cleanliness that I had held the Mandalay Bay to in prior years.
50,Beautiful hotel with all the amenities needed. Check in and check out was seamless. Staff members were friendly and helpful. Pool area was very nice. However we were not very impressed with the restaurant selection(s) and decided to dine out in other areas of the strip. Overall we enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would definitely recommend to others.
50,Overall it's my favorite casino on the strip. It might not be right in the center but it's worth having to do some walking if you'll be using the pool. The Mandalay Beach Pool offers a lot more than just a regular pool. It has a lazy river wave pool and regular pools to enjoy. Lots of options for food and drinks as well. If you can afford to splurge a little a cabana is worth every penny. You won't have to worry about finding chairs and you can have some shade too.
50,Had a great time! The kids really loved the pool! We checked in and got to our rooms with no issues. I did book through priceline so any changes to your itinerary are not possible. Other than that we really enjoyed our stay.
10,"the hotel unlawfully take your security deposit. I booked the hotel from this past July 29th till July 31st at Mandalay Bay Hotel. My confirmation number of the reservation is VCX-007UG5RM. On the day when I checked in on July 29th the front desk charged me S220 dollars security deposit with the explanation that any damage of the property or premise shall be covered by the security deposit. Regarding this security deposit no written documentation or any agreement in contractual type was presented from the hotel to the customer about how the security deposit would be itemized or classify or use for anything aside from the possible damage which may cause by the customer.    Note that nothing about anything ever said at penalty fee or fine at the point. I checked out as the schedule indicated on July 31st before the checking-out deadline.    On August 3rd I found out that my security deposit has been charged entirely. Then I called the front desk asking about the billing issue. The representative explained to me that since I put two of my small bottled water in the fridge for refrigeration in my hotel room which the hotel named the only fridge as ""minibar"" so that $220 is currently served as a fine for penalizing me store 2 water into the fridge.    Two issues here. Issue one: When and where we were instructed that none of our personal small bottle water cannot be stored in the ONLY FRIDGE in our hotel room? Any contract or consent we have given or any remainder given by the hotel beforehand? None of the hotel service ever told me that if you put your personal bottle water into the ONLY FRIDGE in your hotel room your security deposit would be gone. This is informational defect to by tort law.    Issue two: How can the hotel expect the customer to know that the only fridge in the hotel room cannot be used for the common purpose of chilling water? How can anyone know if the only fridge visually in the hotel cannot be used as a fridge let along I did not store any food or things that could create foul or toxic smell in the fridge. Just because they named that as the minibar so it cannot be used for storing bottle water. Most importantly no written or implied rule has ever been posted anywhere to the customer that any storage of bottle water in the fridge would be subject to payment? Where is the warning or stated law?    Based on this informational defect and none of the damage ever created by me as a guest my security deposit should have funded back to me 3 day after checking out of the hotel. However I have not received the return payment. They charged me $220 in fully with a bad attitude telephone operator talking to me over the the phone. I'll never ever visit this hotel again!!!"
50,We loved the view from our suite and the bathroom. The 2 sinks really helped and there was even a door separating the toilet from the rest of the bathroom. Nice job! MGM Life also had very nice people helping us.
40,Pools are great. Kinda far at the end of the strip but overall a nice. Only thing was it took us 1.5 to get our bags after limo dropped us off. I had to go track them down..staff were on their cell phones.
20,Our room was drenched in water leading to the bathroom so I informed the receptionist and no one did anything I slipped that night from the carpet so our carpet was wet all the way to our beds for the whole stay and no one did anything we kept letting them know and all we got was I’m sorry I’ll let someone know
20,I think the hotel is definitely due for a remodel. The first room we checked into was hot and stuffy. After they couldn’t get the air to work we were moved to another room that had a leak. We were told to shower in the dark to avoid an electrical fire. SMH
20,While LV may be re-opening the entire stay was FAR below par from all of our prior stays. The amenities are all there but things are dirty rude staff cocktail waitresses not ample enough in the casino lack of hand sanitizer paper towels etc. Room was dirtier than prior stays liveable yes but notably lack of proper cleanliness. Public hair on the floor and tub towels with holes in them black smears on the tile floor etc. The list goes on and on. While we love Mandalay Bay we were just disappointed that our post-COVID trip there was just sub par.
50,It was awesome experience. we had the VIP package and they went above and beyond. Room was nice. The casinos were fun the food was great. The host valet maids and Concierge team were above and beyond for their service. thank you for the best trip for awhile. We would love to stay there again!!!
50,Everything was perfect. The smiles and memories we created are priceless. The pool lazy river and wave pool was more then expected. The casino was a little rough on me but that is expected. Normally I stay across the street at MGM grand but with the kids this was perfect.
40,Room was clean and maid service was good. Valet was very good. Casino was not busy - dealers ranged from good to distant/distracted. Restaurants were fine except Sea Breeze Cafe - avoid it at all costs (service was bad and food was worse).
50,I went to celebrate my son's 17 birthday we weren't sure what hotel to get. We went and decided to book in Mandalay Bay. This hotel is really nice and clean. They have friendly staff that are willing to help you at anytime. We will be coming back soon. I totally recommend Mandalay Bay Hotel.
40,nice pool (wave pool and lazy river)...attendants there were quite helpful and friendly. Keyless check-in was fine until we had to go get a key to access another floor to get to a functioning ice machine (the ice machine on our floor was broken)...40 minute wait just to get a key to access ice (when all I wanted was to skip check-in).
40,The bed was old and in poor shape--my husband could feel the pressure of the springs on his ribs and my back hurt so bad for the two days I was staying there I could hardly sit up or lay down without intense pain. That aside the resort was nice. The facility was clean the food was delicious and the pool was amazing! The wave pool and lazy river were the highlight of my trip. I will say though the slots did nothing but eat my money and pay back nothing.
30,Housekeeping did not come through for us. There was 1 tissue in box and 1 night of no towel replacement. There were bags of dirty bedsheets in the hallways and there was overflowing garbage by the elevators.
10,The room was dirty shower filled up with water the toilet roared when flushed the AC was inefficient the line to go down the elevator was 40 minutes…. (I have a great pic of the line)….totally unacceptable….
50,Had a wonderful vacation staying at mandalas. Friendly service spacious rooms awesome pools great dining and awesome aquarium. The casino was very clean and spacious multiple dining options and the tram to next door hotels was a wonderful option.
30,For the cost of a nights stay there are other hotels on the strip that provide more value.    The room itself was pretty good. We stayed in a king bed resort room. There was plenty of space in the bathroom & closets. The room had plenty of counter space which was nice. The issue I had with the room is that the walls are thin and there’s a pretty big gap at the bottom of the door. Throughout our stay we constantly could here people. We could hear our neighbors talking about their new business kids wandering up and down the hall and just normal conversations between people as they walk to the elevators. Be prepared to hear a lot.    Speaking of elevators the ones at Mandalay Bay take awhile. Since the pool is on the bottom floor the elevators are constantly full. Trying to get to our room took forever.    As for getting around the hotel the food court is quite a walk from the rooms. To go from the hotel room elevators to the food court takes about 10-15 mins. Also some of the signage is not great. Be prepared to wander around the hotel trying to figure out where things are located.    As for the casino in addition to being a little small the slots for the weekend were super tight. $20 barely lasted 10 minutes even when playing with the minimum bet. We played on so many machines and didn’t hit on any of them (unless you count spending 80 cents to get 20 cents). I get the casino is probably trying to make back money lost during lockdown but it’s no fun if you just take our money.    When it comes to staff most of the staff we interacted with were nice. However there were two different front desk staff that had a condescending tone when I asked a question. My questions were pretty standard but when the staff responded they made me feel stupid. One question was “does the room have a fridge other than the one for the minibar”. My 2nd question to the 2nd staff member was “how do I claim my $50 dining credit”. In both situations a friendly simple response would have sufficed. The attitude was unnecessary. I’m hoping they were just having a bad day but they do need to remember they are dealing with customers. I’m pretty easy going and I do like to chat with the staff to make their day a little easier. This is the 1st time I’ve received that kind of attitude.    Overall while the pools and gym are really cool the rest of the casino is average at best. Considering how much it costs you’re better off booking a room at a different hotel on the strip.
30,Every other hotel room we have stayed in has a little coffee maker for a free cup of coffee. Not at Mandalay Bay there is a 10 dollar charge for the coffee. And if you want to use the small refrigerator that will cost you $50
40,The property was excellent and the rooms were clean. The pool area was the highlight of the trip and the shark reef was great for my daughter. I did not fun any areas of concern or anything that would prevent me from coming back.
10,We booked a room with a king bed. We were given a room with two queens. When we complained we were told ‘it’s the same room’ repeatedly. They finally offered a food credit for giving away our room which we accepted but which was never applied to our account and which I’m still trying to get days later. Worst staff/experience I’ve had in Vegas
10,This place is very overrated water in the room cost $20 dollars for a bottle they charge you $50 dollars to put your own drinks in the refrigerator. Very expensive and not worth it.. I will not stay at this place ever again.
50,The hotel was super clean and had friendly staff. It has many different options inside the hotel for fun experience. Great food and very comfortable beds. The location is great not too overwhelming and not too far away. Right next to the airport and the raiders stadium.
20,Staff was amazing for price point of hotel had expected cleaner standards. There was mold in bathroom shower also dust on many surfaces. The stay was short so didn’t want to complain. Stayed our one night and booked room else where.
30,When we arrived at Mandalay Bay we were rushed through our check in. My wife and I were celebrating our 29th anniversary. We mentioned it to the person helping us check in. Nobody cared about It and never heard anything more about it. Then when we went to the daylight beach club pool and they tried to convince me that I needed to spend $250 for my wife and I to enter or at least $125. Until I went to ask about it at the front desk. Then it was free off guest….. hmmmm—— scam! Same thing at Moorea beach club. Why must you treat your guests that way do I not pay enough money to stay at your resort??? By the way the WiFi in the room was very week too. Maybe you should raise you prices even more to correct these issues! Example…instead of $15 a drink to $25 a drink. That might help
10,First of off the wifi is terrible. It is so slow and connects and then disconnects. My boyfriend and I had a real estate exam to take over the weekend which I couldn’t take due to this issue. Secondly the day of check out which was this past Sunday we waiting for an elevator for more than 30 minutes after having to take 24 flights of stairs down carrying all my luggage. This is just unacceptable and we would never stay at this resort again.
20,Every time we left our room we had wait about 30 minutes to use the elevators. Rooms and staff were friendly. Location is good if you plan to stay at the hotel but horrible if you plan to leave so plan your trip accordingly. Very family friendly. Wish they had more restaurant options
20,I have wanted to stay at Mandalay Bay for almost a decade now! Their pools were the biggest allure to me. However everything about the trip was a letdown. The pools and pool areas were disgustingly dirty. The lazy river and all surrounding pool areas were littered with beer cans bottles plastic cups and straws. Chairs were not being monitored for non-usage. There was a CONSTANT line to get to the elevators for the first 25 floors. Most of the staff were not friendly. Everything was extremely dirty. The bathroom walls had running water and knocking sounds through the night. You can’t even use the mini fridge to STORE items like left overs or waters. You have to pay $30 per day for valet. The 2 points come from the fact that the lady at check in helped to get me and my family/friends joining rooms and the fact that the chicken quesadilla from room service was delicious. Haha (I’m trying to be nice here but I’ll never stay here again and definitely don’t recommend it.) We kept constantly being surprised at what a let down the entire stay/experience was.
40,great pool with wave pool and lazy river. Absolutely fun. Room was nicely renovated and clean but I guess the fridge was not cleaned since there was a left over food was left from previous guests. but everything was clean and loved new technology how there was a tv was in the mirror? It was cool. Only problem we had was the next room was having party and playing music so loud for hours so we called the guest service for the security but they never showed up so we had to call several time in order to sleep
50,Mandalay Bay is top tier hotel with wonderful service. Great view especially being on the 56 floor. Hotel was clean the restaurant food was absolutely delicious especially the sushi place called Kumi. Will come back again.
10,Stayed in room 30-225. He right hand side sink did not drain properly. Had to wait almost a day to get it fixed. We arrived & quickly found we had only three towels. Of the three towels one had to used as the shower mat. We also had no shampoo. We called waited 45 minutes then called again. Finally got towels & shampoo. Onto the elevators. Every elevator we got on had at least one card reader that didn’t work. We watched as many guests got frustrated when trying to scan their room cards. What was worse was that every single elevator had at least one defective room card reader. We also rented a sun villa at Moorea beach. We had two sun loungers that were dirty & torn up. The material was literally ripped with big holes. I can’t imagine that the employees didn’t see this. Sure made us feel special. It was even more disappointing when one of the loungers actually broke while I was reclined in it. We had to put it out in front of the sun villa & told the cabana hostess. No one took it away while we there. Additionally the team did not run from Tuesday to Friday when we there. However it was running for the larger crowds on Saturday & Sunday. I guess weekday guests are simply less than. Also the main elevators to the parking garage from the hotel were all closed. Everyone was forced to do an even longer walk around the restaurants which ultimate led you to the parking garage escalators. Navigating escalators with 3 large suitcases was incredibly fun. Everyday of our stay we saw several blue uniformed employees which were always fixing things in a variety of rooms. We figured out these were all some sort of handy man types. We can only assume that MB is falling apart after seeing so many of them out in the halls with their carts full of tools. Finally small detail but nonetheless important. I had two separate cocktail servers bring me wrong drinks. Although I played certainly enough I couldn’t even get what I had specifically asked for. I had to instead just go get my own drinks at several MB bars. What an overall disappointment. I don’t think I’ll ever want to stay at MB again. I’ll make sure to tell all my family friends coworkers & social media.
30,There was far too many dogs in the hotel. I am a dog lover myself. But I witnessed a guest and his dog walking through the casino floor the dog squatted and took a large poop right next to the slot machines on the Casino level. The guest and his dog just disregarded the large mound of poop and took off and went back onto the elevator. On the way to the elevator the dog encountered another dog and they started barking at each other! Which scared my small child! I was in disbelief that this was happening at Mandalay Bay. I don’t think I’ll be staying here again due to dogs being allowed.
20,I booked 7 rooms for my family after a river rafting trip for my 70th birthday. Communication between Mlife and hotel was poor causing anxiety and frustration from beginning to end. Would have expected better
50,One of the first upscale hotels you'll find heading in from California.  Let's you start the fun sooner! Spiffy lobby casino and rooms. Newer slots great sit-down restaurants and casual eateries. Appears some remodeling going on near restaurants and shopping but not intrusive or loud.
30,We had got in and arrived to a dirty room. Dirty towels on the ground open/used soaps and shampoos and trash was still full. Room did not get fully cleaned until 2 nights into our stay. Front desk was very accommodating and kind. Pool was amazing!!!
50,The Mandalay Bay hotel was beautiful. The staff very kind and accommodating. The pools was nice and clean and the food was delicious. We had a wonderful stay at the hotel. The smell of the hotel was nice. Didn't smell like smoke. They sprayed something else so it smelled very nice.
40,It is a great hotel with very fine rooms and this is the best pool in Las Vegas. However it is super hard to find good seats around the pool area unless you're willing to pay top dollars for a daybed or a cabana as their prices are OUTRAGEOUS
10,I was a victim of racism on your hotel  From One of your employees I have a picture of this guy I asked for a specific service he denied a service to me but when I came back to ask one more question he was already helping somebody else with the same issues that happens to be a white person
50,Our stay was very pleasant we experienced good food fantastic pool timeour room was very clean and the bed absolutely comfortable the only possible complain I have is that water and coffee in room is way to expensive so bring your own water!!!
10,Over 1 hour check-ins 30 minute hold times for the front desk 30 minute hold times for the bell desk $10 Aquafina water at the pool rude staff bartender gave my wife his number when I went to the bathroom pigish corporate greed lowest common denominator of corporate soullesness (staff agrees).
50,Once you step into this resort the smell will transport you to the tropics. You immediately crave for some coconut fruity beverage and change into your swim attire because the wave pool is literally waving at you to come down the water is great! Once you get into your room all you want to do is lay on the cloud like sheets and smile because it is so clean and smells so good (the smell is fresh and light nothing overpowering).    The only con I see is the location. For me I love the fact it’s at the end of the strip because there are less people. But if you want to explore the strip just get a taxi/app ride or rent a car.
20,TV not working in one room for three days. Unable to get receipt for stay without calling back. Would only stay again if had to for work. Check in online did not work for me due to conference and check out did not give me a receipt. Had to pay 10$ for coffee that you make in your room. Could not use fridge to put leftovers from restaurant meal in. Crazy when dinners were very expensive at these restaurants
50,Mandalay Bay is our favorite spot in Vegas… having stayed at many  Mid strip we always spend majority of time and end our stays at Mandalay!! So relaxing and beautiful…the service and rooms are superb! Nicest most beautiful luxurious rooms in Vegas!! Entire hotel Smells like paradise always! Impeccably Clean! Pools are the absolute best!! Taxis are always plentiful and trams are a great option… caters to everyone younger and older and somehow maintains a great comfortable balance of families and the younger party crowd!! Everyone is respectful and relaxed and in vacation friendly mode! It’s great!!! You’ll feel relaxed and pampered in the crazy fun of Vegas!!
50,Nothing short of what I expected at Mandalay Bay. Location great amenities and friendly staff. Nice slot machines and a great sports book. Looking forward to my next visit to Las Vegas and staying at Mandalay Bay.
30,3 out of 4 TVs in our suite did not work. The front door lock sensor was broken upon arrival. Our room was hot the whole time and the air conditioner was set on the lowest temp but could not keep our room cool. We paid for a private cabana on an upper level (accessed by elevator only) at the pool and they did not inform us upon making the reservation nor confirmation of our purchase that it was strictly 21 and up so my infant babies could not come with us. This was a family trip. Also the wave pool and lazy river are 48” and up for height requirements. Definitely not a pool to bring kids to.
10,The mobile checkin Apps checked me in to a room that was still someone inside and not cleaned. Then the same Apps checked me out one day earlier than my scheduled check out date. The room provided was not totally cleaned.
30,This place is not what it used to be. The location was always difficult but the hotel is in need of updating. They have removed machines from casino so not much of a selection. Customer service was not great. Just think the newer places are passing them by and they aren’t doing much to keep up.
50,We stayed in a standard 2 queen room. The beds were so comfortable and the room was nice and cool which was needed with the late July heat. Water pressure was fantastic in the shower. The room was large and we had plenty of space to unpack our things. We also had a daybed at Moorea and had a blast! The waitresses were very friendly and helpful and the music was a good mix of rock/rap. Very upbeat! Can't wait to come back.
20,Rooms are old .  Old mattresses  inferior quality sheets  towels worn out  carpet need to replaced .  In short the rooms need to badly upgraded .  besides that the hotel is good lobby is still in good condition  nice places to eat and nice pools
10,Worst hotel experience two consecutive stays in a row. Staff is rude when presented with an issue (housekeeping entered a room with do not disturb sign and app indication moved medications). Elevator down with no advanced warning for individuals with limited mobility. Terrible signage leading you in an endless loop to just find the lobby. This property has not considered any guest with a potential limitation - inadequate designated parking no elevator to the casino from parking lot suite doors that are too heavy to open.
50,We received a deal we couldn’t pass up and decided to take an unplanned trip before school starts back up. Mandalay never disappoints. Kids are 14 and 12 and are able to occupy themselves at the pools.
30,Above average room. Great lobby. The pool area was disgusting. A cesspool of humanity. Loud profane dirty and an extra resort fee automatically billed to the room. We were hoping to be on the Strip but a little quieter. Don’t sacrifice location to stay here. There are too many good choices in Vegas to stay instead of here
50,This trip was more that I imaginedeverything was conveniently located at one spotgamblingentertainmentnightlife and a large variety of shopping and eateriesI really hope to return to this property!!
50,Beautiful rooms excellent food and service stellar pools!! Lots of walking and things are very expensive. Don’t buy water and snacks in the shops by the pool!! I spent $25 on 2 bottles of water and 3 small bags of chips. Excellent stay!
40,I had a great stay at the resort everyone is so friendly and all the food was great. The room was beautiful however there are a few things I would add such as a fridge and microwave for the room. It also was way too crowded in the pools. It would probably be best to go while children are still in school if you’re wanting to enjoy it with less people.
50,Game here for my daughters 16 birthday . Rooms were very clean arm the staff was very friendly . Wave pool and  Lazy river we’re fun . Although the casino was on the strip  it’s still far away from the other bigger casinos
50,My only concern is the access of the parking. Please place more sign going in and out of the parking structure. Most of the visitors are not wearing Mask. I would suggest to Check the rest room regularly to keep it clean and make sure there is enough paper towel hand liquid soap and toilet tissues. Hot and cold water water in the quest room hard to control to adjust the hot and cold.
30,Rooms dated broken doors everywhere mini fridge not stocked TVs broken everything super over priced for the quality of service compared to center strip hotels like Bellagio. Half the stores were still closed and room service charge is a minimum $100 dollar purchase so if your solo or a couple your out of luck unless you eat like a elephant
40,When I'm lounging for the beach and don't want to do a road trip I'll do a staycation here. Pool straight from hotel elevator. Wave pool with the kiddie section is the best for little ones. Hussong's and Slice are delicious.
10,upon arrival i was unable to enter my hotel room because the digital key was reading error. The shower in room had black mold and a broken molding that detached from the wall. while at the pool large crowds of people dressed to go to a basketball game were bathing and tanning by the pool. one specific man was sitting with his hand down his shorts. on another occasion at the front arrivals section of the hotel i was approached and asked if i wanted to buy cocaine. during the entire stay my iphone 12 had poor cell phone signal and a terrible wifi connection. the front desk manager was very helpful and made attempts to make my experience positive the best he could.
40,This was the start of a family 3 week vacation and it was great fun. We had our teenager and she loved the beach/pool area. The lazy river kept her busy for hours. My favorite part is the wave pool. It is so much fun! Overall the casino and rooms are very spacious and nice. Staff is always friendly and helpful. I have never really had any serious problems while staying there. Note however I have not stayed at any other casinos in Vegas. We enjoy it there so that is where we return to.
30,Alittle to far from strip rail trams not working small bottle waters are 9$ there is absolutely no shade in pools unles you pay $300+ machines don't give to just keep playing and enjoying the time.
50,Every time I visit Vegas I use my comp rooms and I have comp rooms at every mgm resort property and still choose Mandalay Bay or Delano every time. I love the property and find myself never really leaving the area.
50,The answer is yes the wave maker and Lazy River Was fantastic.. much better than the MGM .. this is a very nice casino with very open feeling to it and not smokey.. not much traffic going through it do to last casino on the strip.. you can easily take the tram to lexor Excalibur New York New York casinos.. which in my opinion are not worth even walking into.. but we did take the tram as far as it can go the 3rd stop..got off and walked to the Bellagio to watch the water show.. we ate at several restaurants all the food was very good no complaints at all.. and the price was reasonable.. the rooms here are very expensive you're only allowed two people per room extra people are charged per day at a max of 4.. they were five of us so we had to get two rooms.. had a bit of a problem getting out of the parking garage refuse to take my room key.. had to pay an extra $15 to get out.. next few days it worked without problems.. this is a family resort so expect lots of kids in the swimming areas.. but the majority were in The Lazy River.. if we come back we're definitely staying here again..
50,My grandson and I enjoyed our two night stay. Mandalay Bay seems to be a family resort which was nice. All the restaurants are not opened yet due to COVID but the ones that were open had very good food but service was a little slow. Slot machines could have been looser 🤣
30,The hotel is great I really loved the style casino dealers etc. Unfortunately our first issue was when we checked in we had 3 rooms total under our name. Each room was double charged (for the entire stay) on the first day there which resulted in our banking detecting fraud and our accounts being locked and having to wait for it to be figured out. Our little mini bar area in the room was not stocked so we had to keep telling them everyday so they didn't think we used all the stuff. We paid extra for early check ins on the room and ended up having to wait later than the time of the origional check in for our roo. To be ready. Finally on our last night there we went out for the night and returned to the pad lock on our door opened up and 8k worth of winnings stolen from our room. There aren't any hallways cameras so this is very unfortunate and we now have to wait for an investigation on the whole situation. I filled out a report and still havnt had anyone contact me on what to do next. Lastly I was a little upset that my players card was only loged for 3 hrs of gambling with $23....I was there for 4 days and spent everyday playing for quite sometime at multiple mgm properties giving my card every time. So I was so disappointed when I went to check my information and found that almost nothing was documented. So while I really like the hotel itself and everyone was friendly I feel like I got stuck between unfortunate situations and the staff not being as helpful as they could have been.
50,This is my favorite resort in Vegas. It does not have as much through traffic as other casinos and I love the smell (no cigarette odor)! The Tram makes it easy to transfer to the Monorail and it is easy to walk through to Excalibur through Luxor and never go outside. Hands-down the best place to stay in Vegas!
40,Mandalay Bay has shaken out of the 2020 Funk and almost has operations back to normal. While there are still a few things closed or not quite to full capacity the stay was care free and relaxing. The tram being out a couple days definitely pushed us to Uber more but was only a minor inconvenience.
50,We stayed here overnight on our way home from a mini vacation in Southern California. As always this hotel did not disappoint. Parking was easy the staff were very nice and the room was welcoming and very comfortable.
50,We will return soon keep up the great your house keeping staff is on point how they clean and if u need anything they respond on time we had a problem with TV service and your maintence respond quick and
40,Accommodations are nice but overall hotel seemed understaffed at times. Room was not ready for us upon our arrival requiring several calls to guest services which required longer than average wait times. Some were courteous and happy to help while others were rude. We’ve stayed he before and had a much better experience. Hopefully this was only a limited incident consequence of covid.
50,Cleanest casino and nicest suites in all of the Vegas especially on the strip. We eloped here this trip and usually stay a different hotel each visit this is my favorite out of the MGM brand hotels we will come back
40,Excellent service Everything was very expensive. I realize just came out of pandemic but $20 for water out of mini bar? Had a great time very nice casino and pools where great. Tram being closed on Wed and Thur means a lot of walking if you want to explore .
40,Excellent place to stay in Vegas. The rooms are spacious there are many food/restaurant options to choose from the pools are fantastic and the service was consistently good.    The only drawbacks: the hotel rooms are a bit old (but kept up well and very clean) the fitness club is only open 8-5 (there is a 24 hour cardio center but it is nowhere near as nice as the fitness center) and the location is a bit out of the way (a monorail in the hotel that connects you to Luxor and Excalibur helps solve that problem).    I would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again.
40,Nice room great pool. Overcharged you with something as simple as coffee. They charge you $10 for even moving the Kuerig coffee kit. Most hotels give complimentary coffee. Also they have a mini bar refrigerator. That’s ok but if you put in your water bottle (and they leave space to entice you to do so) they charge you $50. Poot attempt to nickel and dime you. It was annoying.
50,beautiful hotel very clean rooms were great size views from our room were gorgeous the shark reef was a lot of fun slots were of good variety food courts and restaurants were also of good variety overall a memorable visit!
50,"The view from the Top floor is amazing. Be sure to try all the pools including the ""lazy river"" and of course see Shark Reef. The steaks at Strip Steak are 5 star and the quietness of my room was appreciated."
50,Absolutely loved our stay here! The room was amazing and the pool area was perfect for us! We work lol definitely be staying here again! Perfect place to stay with the family or for couples or a business trip!
30,TUE – FRI 20-23 July 2021 – WITH DAUGHTER’S FAMILY – ADJOINING ROOMS    ******ARRIVAL******  We vacationed here with our daughter her husband and their two boys ages 2 and 5 in rooms 21-106 & 108. We were not guaranteed adjoining rooms until check-in and so my wife did not do the digital check-in and keys. Turns out we could have done that just as easily. Bonus! - we would have self-parked easily without incident. Except that the digital keys do not work with self-parking and we would have needed to go to registration anyway.    Since we arrived first our daughter had to invite my wife onto her registration to be able to get into her room which was helpful when my wife discovered each room had only 2 towels and no wash cloths or hand towels. Yet my wife could not order towels for her when she called but had to hang up go into our daughters room and USE HER PHONE to call downstairs and be on hold for another 10 minutes!  TIP: If you have kids and will not purchase refrigerator items have them locked so the kids don’t move the excessively expensive sensored and auto-charged merchandise (see below).    Elevators: We had to learn how to use them from others. You must put your key card on the sensor before punching in your floor number. The elevator panels on the left only work sporadically so always use the ones on the right a challenge when crowded.    PARKING: Valet $26 Self-Parking $15 – Normally $11 per day less is a no brainer for us but after my initial self-parking fiasco I was not sure. My tale is so long that I do not have the space here to describe it. Suffice it to say that I turned left immediately after the lobby area where the sign points to self-parking and followed the winding road and signs. The LAST sign and arrow points straight ahead for self-parking JUST BEFORE THE ROAD CURVES into the stop light. Really? At the light there are no signs and you can go left right or straight ahead to a parking building which says “The Shoppes Valet Parking”. Since the last sign pointed straight ahead I went straight and parked in the garage where my adventure started. So turn left at the light onto W. Mandalay Bay Rd going under the overpass upon which you will follow signs to West Self-Parking .  TIP: When self-parking in the garage find the escalators first then park accordingly. Otherwise it’s possible to miss them.    ******ROOM******  Very clean and spacious including bathroom with a separate bath/shower. The toilet will startle you the first time you flush it. We love the floor to ceiling window very cool! We stayed here in July 2003. I don’t remember much except that we loved the open view. We still loved the open view even if it was the airport.    Tip: The room USB connections do not power more than one device so you need a powered plug for multi-ports.    TEMPERATURE: The rooms do not get cool enough according to us our daughter’s family and the gentlemen who complained about it in the elevator. The fact that there is no temperature gauge nor ceiling fans in the rooms suggests that they are intentionally not cooling the rooms to a comfortable level so you do not spend excessive time there. But you cannot really verify it or complain about it effectively unless you have a temperature gauge. The casino area temperature is cold.    Tips: 1-Make sure the fan is on high and close your sheers as much as possible and close the curtains when you are not there.  2-Bring a small fan if you run warm.    REFRIGERATOR: You don’t have one. The hotel has a refrigerator in your room filled with their merchandise on sensors which instantly charge you when an item is moved. So do not even think about using it. And as soon as you buy something you also incur a $50 service/restocking fee. See the pic for prices.    ******POOLS******  GENERAL:  -They have an inflation hose by the lazy river entry – yayyyyyy!  -No umbrella’s. You want one? Rent a lounger or cabana (muey $$$). In addition to gouging that is just plain unkind. Not only is it very hot in the summer but both kids and adults can get sunburned easily.    CABANA’s: There are half a dozen options or more which average $100 per person per day. The minimum size is 4 persons and are about $500 day. Sometimes discounted during the week as we saw $375 posted on Wednesday. I think the max size is 14 persons which go from between $1200-$1300 per day.    LAZY RIVER:  -Decent size 2 cool little waterfalls and moves at a very decent clip. Loved it.  -Water is very cold in the first moment you get in and then immediately very nice after.    WAVE POOL:  -Disappointingly small waves. I guess we have been spoiled by Big Surf in Tempe AZ.  -Except that you must be 48” to get in guardians or not. If they are going to have such small waves then the height minimum should be like 36-40”. This is what happens when decisions are made by lawyers.    ******OTHER AMENITIES******  RESTAURANTS (half closed):  Food Court: Check out the coupons in the paper inserts for the trays first. It may be a better deal for you. Food was typical of the individual vendors no better or worse than stand-alone locations. We thought Panda Express had very decent food and good portions comparatively.    Citizen’s restaurant was very good. We had take-out food for breakfast and dinner there.  Javier’s restaurant in the Aria complex had excellent Mexican food and margaritas.    SHARK REEF AQUARIUM  Our 2 grandchildren were 4 and under and free. Ridiculous otherwise. We were $26 each which is less than what it says online. Aside from the price it is pretty awesome and our 4 year old really enjoyed it. The 1.5 year old less so. Neither wanted to touch the stingrays interactive which I thought was pretty cool.    TRAMS: Free and operate from Mandalay Bay to the Luxor and then Excalibur but skips the Luxor on the way back – allegedly. We never saw one. At first we were told they operated Thursday-Sunday. On Thursday we were told Friday-Sunday.    MONORAIL: Operates from the MGM Grand to the Sahara and you must buy tickets. Don’t know if it was running.    INDOOR PASSAGEWAYS: There are indoor passageways from MB to Excalibur with shops along the way of course. Supposedly there are also indoor passageways between Aria and Monte Carlo Paris & Bally's Palazzo and Venetian Wynn and Encore and more.    This was a family vacation and we stayed at the Mandalay Bay for our grandchildren’s sake for the water park. While less than stellar service is “pandemic” almost everywhere at this time we will never go back to Mandalay Bay for ourselves if it means being very warm muggy and just plain uncomfortable even at night. Warmth is subjective and so for context we keep our home at 76 and turn it down to 74-75 when we are being active (cleaning etc). At night we turn the AC down to 70. Our daughter and her family keep their home at 78 and they complained about the warmth too.
50,Teresa in housekeeping was full of smiles made you feel at home and made sure we had everything we needed. Our room was cleaned to perfection. She is by far an asset to your hotel. She deserves to be recognized for her hard work and hospitality. She was amazing.
30,"Upon arrival at third level self-parking garage there were no signs indicating how to get to hotel check-in. Elevators were inoperative and the garage escalator to Casino broken from second to first level. No employees available to assist with bags down escalator. Finally a ""good Samaritan"" hotel guest helped us. At ground level no signs indicating where to check-in. Very confusing. Once in hotel lobby opted for ""mobile check-in"" and after getting text directing me to go to ""mobile check-in kiosk"" could not find kiosk. Again NO SIGNS. Absolutely unbelievable! Once I arrived at my room everything got better. The room was spacious and recently renovated. I liked the Keurig coffee maker and fast wi-fi. Also loved the marble bath with soaking tub and incredibly comfortable king bed. Now that I know my way around this place I'll be back."
50,This hotel was the nicest cleanest friendliest place I've ever been Their pool is amazing I definitely recommend anyone stay here The check in was super easy everyone was willing to help the stuff at the pool we're also very nice I just love this place altogether
10,Please read previous review where I stayed multiple times that staff were discriminatory and aggressive.    My tub and shower were not properly  Cleaned which led athletes foot    Service was horrible and housekeeper claimed they ran out of towels    Not worth what was paid.
20,My car was vandalized in the secure parking garage someone punctured my fuel tank on my 2021 F150 and was attempting to drain the fuel tank. The room and linen staff didn’t give any bedding for kids bed gave nasty attitude when we tried to get bedding and acted as if it was our fault that they had dropped the ball. Hotel is old and out dated and room was shabby and worn out.
20,This was supposed to be an unforgettable wedding experience in a positive way but it was not It was a negative wedding experience. We had asked for silverware and plates and never received them. Our wedding cake went to waste we had to throw the cake away because we did not have any plates or silverware.
50,very nice property the pool is great and spacious. Wait staff is readily available. It is good being a part of M life with other M life casinos near by. Mandalay Bay offers many restaurants....Variety of food choices. Looking forward to next visit!
10,Horrible services. No one in the front desk gives a dam. I can’t get a hold of a casino host either.  Never cone to this resort again. They have lost me. I am going back to the Harras entertainment resorts.
50,We loved getting to stay here! Our Strip View King Room had such a great view of the strip. We were on the 15th floor and we could see a long ways down the strip! Clean room and we both slept great! We will definitely stay there again sometime!
40,I found the hotel to be extremely nice and comfortable. While realizing things are still not back to normal after COVID and they may be short staffed there could be more options for food that are open later. The food court is WAY too far away from the hotel property and Subway was the only thing open late at night. Again maybe due to COVID but the pool area closes too early also. If you are attending a conference there really wasn't enough time to enjoy a lot of the amenities because things close too early.
40,Great place to stay in Vegas especially when compared to any property proximal to it's location. The Bellagio and Caesars are a little up the strip and Mandalay is off the beaten path at the far south end.
10,The service was substandard. We asked housekeeping for face towels because originally there were none in our room. They gave us hand towels and said they could not give us face towels because they were none clean. Prices at Strip Steak were overpriced. Service was great but steak portions could improve. Valet was excellent but we asked the bellhop to help us with groceries up to our room. They were just standing around and told me they are only there to help incoming guests even though I valet parked my car everyday. I think there should be better service for customers that need help bringing things up to the room with no problem. I was willing to tip but he totally told us no that is not a service they do. It was in the middle of the day and two bellhops were there just talking to each other. At a five star hotel I would have expected better service. The front desk was nice checking-in but I found it annoying that checkout was done by a kiosk and your bill was not emailed to you right away. So I had to wait in line to get my printout of my bill. Luckily I did. They tried to charge me for a $12.00 imported beer when I don't drink. Just because I put salsa that I purchased from Whole foods should not set off a drink scale. I feel this could have been better way to regulate the items in the fridge. So please ask for the bill. Don't wait until you get home to look over your charges. There were parties every night. Very noisy at 3am.
10,Smelly and dirty and rude staff. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A GOOD ROOM the place was terrible we could not beg for service let alone good service. The room was by for the worst place we have ever stayed . The m life system did nothing to help us while we lost tons of money we would sure like to be able to enjoy losing by having a nice place to lose it in
50,I usually stay at another resort but the food accommodations and service here were fantastic. Definitely will be visiting again. Staff went above and beyond to make sure everything we needed was taken care of.
40,Got 3 rooms 1 was ready on time others not till 6. they did tell us we can get another room at 3 but it would be 11th floor which is not a good view of strip. Decided to wait and got 12th floor wait was pointless. Paid extra for strip view and got a bad strip view
50,Great resort love every restaurant shop casino and the suite was wonderful. I love how there are 3 elevator banks so the wait is never super long for an elevator. The staff though are exceptional. Polite very engaging and you can tell they're either very well trained or love their job!
30,We paid over $2000 for our week long stay and nothing not even a water was included. Had no way to refrigerate anything of your own unless you wanted to pay extra. Couldn’t even get clean towels daily or have showers at times.
50,Contactless check in and digital room key and digital parking ticket made everything easier and faster! The room was beautiful and comfortable! Definitely will be returning! The pools were clean service there was great overall.
50,We love this Hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The Hotel is clean and beautiful. My family had a blast in the wave pool area. It’s the Best swimming pool in the strip. It’s very secure and safety is priority at the Bay. Thank you for a great stay MB!
10,This place is neither a resort nor a full service hotel by traditional standards. MGM Mandaly Bay uses guests as captive walking ATMs. Unlike virtually every hotel you are charged for everything. In your room a cup of instant coffee is $10. Pool closes at 7pm. Smoking OK everywhere it seems. Avoid this expensive wasteland.
30,I didn’t stay at Mandalay Bay but went to the casino every day. It was clean and relatively smoke free or at least it was less smoky than MGM where I also went. So if you want a nicer smelling environment for gambling I recommend giving Mandalay Bay a try
50,Mandalay Bay is very classy. They have excellent service at their Bars and Restaurants. Swimming pool and lazy river is alway great relaxation time. We stayed in a suite this time. It was simply awesome neat and very clean with a gorgeous view to the strip.
30,"Flew out early morning Sunday to meet my sister even splurged on early check in which I did not get in to get there and be charged an additional $400 for ""incidentals"" no where on my initial booking my room was it stated $100 a day security deposit wiped me out before I even checked in somewhere it should state you will owe this much per day on top of what we just billed you for a ""comp"" room! So for a comp room it ended up costing me $157 I guess It needs to be clearer.because it tied up my money for the 4 days I was there It ruined my trip all my extra money paid for a nice time in my room if we did anything my sister paid for me to do it Just not a nice way to see my sister and neice after a year and a half I won't be back to Mandalay Bay much less Las Vegas 3 chances ive given that place it just is not my cup of tea. I will take Laughlin All day long much more pleasant stay even if I dont do nothing! People are super nice and a comp is a true comp and incidental costs are affordable thanks but no thanks Vegas and Mandalay bay this was my experience sadly I was disappointed."
40,Clean hotel spacious restroom nice smelling hotel. Awesome pools. Very nice places to eat. Excellent housekeeping. Good air-conditioned room. Good options for TV to plug in consoles or firestick.fun
50,Beautiful rooms amazing service from literally every staff person I encountered. Pampering yourself at Spa Mandalay is a must for every visit! The prices are a bit high but again the service is impeccable!
40,Enjoy our recent stay at the Mandalay Bay. I signed up for the VIP package. I’d highly recommend. Didn’t have to worry about getting to/from the airport to the hotel. Also with the VIP package we had no problems with checking into our room early! It was great!
40,Hotel was clean and room was very nice. But the bed was out dated and needed to be replaced. Don’t touch the refrigerator cause they charge for touching anything in it and if you put something in there they charge $50.
30,Front desk staff was great bathroom looked like it wasn't cleaned from the previous use. Air conditioner didn't work very well coolest it got was around 76-77. Pool staff was a little on the rude side.
10,"After some health delays my family and I were very excited to continue our annual vacation to Mandalay Bay but we were very disappointed in our last night's stay. At roughly 2:30 AM the alarms went off and the messaging over the loud speaker was very generic and didn't provide any instructions or directions. Being awaken at 2:30 AM and then having to walk down 21 flights of stairs (my parents are in their late 70's) and not having any type of indication of the severity of the issue was a little concerning. Once downstairs we proceeded to the front desk (to see if the issue was cleared) and the employee was extremely condescending and tried to make us feel foolish for running down 21 flights of stairs and assuming the worst. Considering the unfortunate event that occurred at your hotel a few years back I was VERY offset that your employee would question our level of concern. The fact that there was no direction on your alarm message there were ZERO employees who came to Floor 21 to attempt to calm your customers or provide any type of message and then to have your employee talk down to us for acting on our instincts (which we had to do due to lack of ANY communication from your team) is about the worst ""Customer Service"" experience I've come across. And yes we ended up packing our bags and left at 3:30 AM as my entire family was offset by the experience and unable to get back to sleep."
50,The staff were super friendly/helpful. Our room was clean and they came and picked it up while we were gone. We had free parking at other casinos which made it easier to go deeper into the strip without having to walk! All of our family stayed here since my husband and I were getting married. They made every accommodation for us. Loved our stay!
30,AVARGE stay. I get more amendies ar hotels at a best Western. They charge for handicap that’s what was disappointing. No fridge unless asked if that was her medication. No microwave for the amount of money was paying to stay there. The rooms were nice I give them that.
50,Lots of pools    Covid closed the buffet which made eating a little more cumbersome  Michael Jackson One show opens soon but we missed it room rates reasonable therefore but I looked in future and they are back up destination resort feel taxi to go down the strip    Must try the Virtual Reality at the Shark Experience feel like you are in the water swimming with them one of the coolest things I've done
50,If you want a bit of serenity while in Vegas stay at Mandalay Bay or Delano. Both resorts are at the bottom of the strip and fairly mellow. Clean and easy to navigate food is good the beach is awesome.
30,Mandalay has great pools awesome rates and a fun aquarium; however they have not updated the casino in quite some time. The restaurant selection is pretty lame the rooms and casino are for sure outdated compared to their counterparts in terms of size and entertainment. It definitely is getting that not so fresh vibe.
50,This was the first hotel/casinos I visited with my parents during our family trip in Las Vegas: it was the one I loved the most! Lavish and breathtaking I remember it mostly for the fact I ate the best sushi of my entire life. Recommended 100%!
40,Their digital key system needs improvement it makes it hard to see family on other floors and often the terminals don't read the digital key on the first try    The mgm app works fine for reservations and the like however it's still in the early stagea of development    Also they could use more wifi boosters around the elevators    Otherwise the staff is wonderful many props to the staff
50,The Mandalay Bay is Awesome! Always clean and friendly staff. Pools are awesome!! The only negative I could mention is the service at the pools not enough staff to take or serve drink or food orders. But before COVID it wasn’t like this
40,Mandalay Bay is at the very end of the strip. So there isn't walking around different casinos. It has a great wave pool lazy river and has a setup to have outdoor pool concerts. There wasn't one while we were there but I imagine it would be a blast. Food and drinks are off the chart expensive. Other than that a good hotel.
50,Very clean and well maintained this casino has been our favorite place to relax and gamble. The wave pool was fantastic and the endless river was so much fun. The food was wonderful and we enjoyed every mouth full.
40,The shower had a great deal of mildew. First room had bathroom leak.    Staff was wonderful .    Pool closed for one of the days we were there. They said it was due to weather however they left the pool you have to pay to get in open .  Also neighboring pool was Four Seasons was also not closed.    It was extremely expensive to eat and drink and honestly I am not a cheap person. Food at the House of Blues in the hotel was so greasy we could not eat it.
40,This resort is absolutely amazing my family and I will be back. Everything from the food to the pool was hands down the best experience you will relieve in vegas. The smokeless casino was a welcome bonus as well.
50,This trip was a reboot for us after being in doors for a year. My experience at the pool made me feel like a kid again when my siblings and I would spend hours in our pool with our parents. Thank you.
50,Beautiful location with a gorgeous view! Staff was friendly and polite! Food was pretty but bland. It’s walking distance from the main strip and there is so much to do! There was never a dull moment!!
50,I always rave about Mandalay Bay to everyone I talk to (family/co-workers/friends). I rave about how comfortable the rooms are how amazing all your pools/lazy river/cabanas are and the how marvelous/helpful/supportive/courteous/patient ALL staff members are at Mandalay Bay to every guest.
40,Absolutely beautiful and we'll worth every penny. Parking is a B**** but the rooms and the hotel and casino is very nice. I booked a room down lower but because I booked 6 months in advance I was upgraded to the top floor! Such a wonderful experience!
50,This is a very nice and clean hotel and casino. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The rooms are very well appointed and comfortable. There is a good selection of restaurants with exceptional food choices.
10,There was blood on one of the rooms they moved us and the other room had trash and a razor!!!! It was disgusting plus’s the keys didn’t work. They staff was horrendous they offered us 100 dollar drink and food voucher
50,Mandalay Bay is paradise. Best casino best rooms and best food on the strip. Aria class and Grand prices. Excellent location if you're looking to stay on campus and don't want to walk the strip and you don't need to everything you need is at Mandalay. Tons of restaurants best day clubs and best bars if you're looking for high quality drinks and conversation. Want dancing and club music go elsewhere. The rooms are ultra quiet with amazing views.
50,One of the nicest places to stay on the strip. Customer service was very assertive and all staff was willing to help with no attitude or irritation. I will definitely stay here again and bring more guests with me.
50,The hotel casino restaurants and pool area at Mandalay are one of my favorites in Vegas. I’ve stayed at 4 other hotels and this presidential suite was hands down my favorite of all the venues. Highly recommend staying here!
40,Our stay at Mandalay Bay this July was a blast. My only frustration was with the weather. The pool closed 3 days out of the 6 days we stayed. Breakfast at the House of Blues (HOBs) was DELICIOUS!! Enjoyed the Shark Reef.
40,Hotel was good except the mold in the shower towel shortage and digital key was a pain in the butt. I would double check the shower before unpacking that way if you need to move you can also go with the original keycard and save yourself the hassle.
10,The hotel is understaffed which results in delayed extremely slow and incompetent not to mention impolite customer service on all fronts. Worse one of the employees stole cash from my purse while I was out of the room! The purse was put away in one of the drawers so it is clear someone rummaged around to find something to steal. Thankfully noone was able to open the safe in which we had put other valuables. It was a terrible violation. I had a 2 bedroom suite and paid extra for a VIP experience well what an experience that was! The room itself showed signs of extreme wear. The furniture was coming apart there were tears and stains on some of the lampshades the bathroom towels were woefully thin and ragged like they had been picked up at a 1 dollar garage sale. My daughter's white bedsheets were stained brown upon arrival. Gross. Makes me think noone bothered to change the sheets or clean the room before our arrival. The ice machine on our floor was broken. Half of the restaurants were closed. We spent thousands of dollars on the pool cabana only to receive a distinctly frosty reception from the front desk cabana check-in employee and some of the servers (others were great). We were informed daily that certain food and drink items were not available or had run out. The tram to Luxor and Excalibur were closed. The elevators were malfunctioning causing long lines and for people to be stuffed in there like sardines in the middle of a pandemic that ostensibly requires social distancing. My husband and I started staying at your hotel about 20 years ago when it was pristine and truly the best that the strip had to offer. We continued staying there for work conventions for family vacations for romantic getaways for friends getaways. Very sad to say that this will be our last stay at Mandalay Bay.
50,Great beds well kept property and excellent staff. What more could you ask for? The facilities are always clean the staff always friendly. At the time of our visit there were a few minor things such as a bit of small/minor construction/renovation at Restaurant Row and other areas the trams were not running during the week but nothing that was inexcusable. Overall and great visit.
10,Charged my card 400 bucks didn’t even clean the room the ac wasent even working I was disappointed with the pool was shut down with thunderstorm I was waiting for drinks to be offered and noting was given I would not go back
20,"While not unique to this property the ridiculous but common ""resort fees"" are offensive. What do you get for that; WiFi and being able to print a boarding pass (instead of using your phone app) for $39 a day. Oh but wait there is a nice coffee maker in the room but unless you check your TV you will not know they charge $10 for coffee (2 cups but that is the minimum). For $10 you would think they would at least include real half/half instead of the powdered crap. The room was dirty when I arrived and after I requested house cleaning the same dirt was still on the carpets. A third call finally got it vacuumed. Not what I would have expected from a so-called upper scale hotel."
30,Mandalay kit below expectations terrible problems with parking it took 3 days to get the room key working. Missed housekeeping on one of our days. Untidy elevator bays on room floor including broken glass that was there for hours even after it was reported.
20,The room was dirty. There were not enough towels. Everything had an additional cost… including a single serving of coffee in the room. The pool closed at 7pm before the sun went down. I don’t think I will choose another MGM hotel if that is what they think excellent service is like. Also parking was chaotic. My key never worked.
50,Just another great stay at Mandalay Bay. Staff is super friendly and is very well kept we did couples massage and it was super. We were very relaxed the rest of the day. The lazy river was a little crowded but it was expected. We were able to find recliners in the shade.
50,Very lovely. I went for my birthday with my significant other. Spacious room with separate tub and shower. The walk from Mandalay to Luxor to Excalibur was also very short. Very easy to navigate between the properties.
40,We had a very nice visit to Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. There are some minor disappointments which have to deal with their signs for directions. A few of them tell you to go one way yet there are no followup signs indicating you are on the right course. This can be and was confusing at times. Also some of thier employees can be rude and also mis-inform you when asking for directions. Also the location leaves you in an isolated spot especailly when the tram is not working. Which in our case was very often. Just very hot to walk to the other hotels...
40,Great place to stay. We have stayed at many hotels in Las Vegas this one is definitely a great stay. I paid for an Elite Suite which was Beautiful! My issue was that it comes with a fully stocked bar with beverages that I don’t drink and you CANNOT use the refrigerator without being charged! ??? Also no microwave. I can get around the microwave but a fully stocked bar SHOULD be optional so guest can store refreshments It was over 100 degrees with no cold beverages. Overall great stay
10,Worst hotel I have ever stayed in.. short staffed.. slow customer service and then never answer phones zero stars for me horrible view from or 2 bedroom suit!! My stay was just horrible the cabana was expensive and the service was bad pool area was very crowded with chairs and just won’t book here again
30,The room was not as clean as expected. Every room should be replenished for each new person that checks into every room and it was not done for myself and my daughter. The hotel is nice but the cleaning of the rooms needs an upgrade.
10,Experience was horrible from start to finish. Rooms were in bad condition from mold broken lights clogged sinks room air conditioning not working. Ice machines broken couldn’t keep anything chilled without being charged a fee to open up mini bar fridge . Call the help desk they respond by saying we can send up a fridge for a resort fee charge of $30. That’s horrible customer service all around.
10,When we checked into our room it was filthy. The sink had money and fake eyelashes on top. I wiped the sink area down with a cleaning wipe and the wipe was black when I was done. There were hairs on the toilet seat and in the tub. There was only one towel in the bathroom. There was trash and candy wrappers on the floor next to the bed. We were completely disgusted. It is completely unacceptable to be put in a dirty room especially with COVID still being an issue. When we addressed the issue with the front desk it was as if it was really not a big deal. We will never stay at Mandalay Bay again.
20,Room wasn't clean ac warm had to re a upstairs more towels shower hadn't been cleaned room was warm most of the time rules at pool changed daily regarding bringing in our own drinks checking took forever
20,no refrigerators the in room refer is stuffed full of mini-bar items and cant be use to store person items also no microwave. furthermore the mini bar is way overpriced. if you take something from mini bar you will be billed
30,You’ll have to be ok with being charged $200 for lounge “chairs” and an extra $100 for an umbrella and expect no service at the pool. If they close unexpectedly they will not refund any portion of your money. Also they have the loudest flushing toilet in the rooms. You feel like you’re using a plane toilet. The room was nice except for the fact that it felt like smoke was being blown into the rooms. It was not well ventilated.
50,Everything was beautiful. We didn't win any money but we had a great time. It's understandable that they are still getting up to speed during this pandemic but there's enough open for one to have a good time.
50,We had a excellent stay at Mandalay Bay! Definitely a family friendly resort the pools are amazing! It was just my husband and I but we enjoyed all the activity around us! This is a high end property and they do charge for water coffee and stuff in the fridge but it is ready for you in your room if you want it. I have back and hip issues so I always worry about beds at hotels these beds are memory foam type and so comfortable! Great service and friendly staff too. Excellent job Mandalay Bay!
50,We passed through on our way back to LA. We selected this hotel because it seemed the most family friendly. We have two teenagers and a 9 year old. We had a great time at the pool although crowded and a lovely dinner little over priced “Stripsteak” for its quality. The hotel room was great and the staff very friendly and professional. We had a great time and we will be back without the kids next time.
50,Mandalay Bay should be considered up there with bellagio and the venetian. Everything was amazing. The bellman was very kind and all the staff in general. The lobby area was really grand with a luxurious golden atmosphere. We had a media suite that was soo spatious with separate TV room from the main living room conference area. My wife loved the shops at the hotel which have great products and the pools are a perfect refuge with a lazy river. Being closest to the airport and just a little bit away from the main buzz of the strip Mandalay Bay is 100 percent one of the best values in Vegas (if not THE best!!)
30,Hotel was great. 2 things prevent me for giving a higher score:    1) the value of cabanas at the pool is super low for the price you pay for it. There are much better value for dollar options elsewhere (food and beverage credit at MGM Grand is an example).    2) wave Pool. We were stocked by the wave pool going in but the frequency of the waves and the weird rule that everyone has to go pass that blue/red line makes it less enjoyable. That’s the only wave pool I’ve been at with this rule that reduce fun for all.    Also: 50$ BlackJack tables on a Tuesday night? Again there are way better options elsewhere but the hotel knows they are at the far end of the strip and people won’t travel that far for a lower table value maybe?
50,I would recommend this resort. It's beautiful for one. And the customer service is great. A bit pricey if you can find a deal that would be a great idea. The people their are very respectful and they are very clean an the food their is great.
50,Our stay at Mandalay Bay was Great! The Staff were excellent and made check in stay and check out very easy. The mobile app was simple to use also. I have seen many reviews saying this is a problem but it was almost easier doing it this way. The elevators were a bit temperamental with key card access ( we were not the only ones who had this issue). The pool scene was excellent and staff were friendly. The beds were extremely comfortable and rooms were cleaned daily or when requested. Overall we had an excellent stay at Mandalay Bay and would stay here again.
40,They Canceled the USA Mens vs Nigeria. After The USA woman lost to the Australian Women team none of the staff said a thing about the cancelation of the second game. The game before they asked if we were coming back after the first game. They did not say dont come back they said thanks good bye. so I wasted time coming back to the mandalay bay to find out it was canceled when i could have been doing something else. And not refund or extra points or anything
40,Mandalay Bay used to keep up with cleaning and sanitizing. The whole time I stayed at the casino and played never once did I see any of the machines getting wiped or cleaned or any wipes to even clean them down or yourselves before plane. Definitely need to keep that up in order to keep us safe healthy environment.
50,The service was exquisite from time of arrival to time of check out. The staff was very welcoming which made it easy for us to feel at home. I’m looking forward to staying at the Mandalay again we had so much fun
50,It is always a good stay. Nice rooms. Pool area is awesome. Kids love the wave pool and lazy river. They have great restaurants. Although located at the very beginning of the strip it is quite nice to get away from some crazy areas of Vegas.
50,Check was fast hotel was really nice rooms were very comfortable. Not over crowded..plenty of attractions..The pools are the best i have seen. I would definitely be coming back here i did not want to leave
30,The hotel was nice but overrated. I’ve always wanted to stay here so we did. Very expensive. They nickel and dime you the entire time. Very crowded. Was looking forward to enjoying the pool area however it was so crowded and not to mention they gouge you with drinks and food.
50,The Mandalay Bay is our favorite place in Vegas and it never disappoints. Brought some family with us this time and they are hooked. Great place for a family with all the different experiences that can be done right on the property.
30,The air conditioning in the room was horrible. I get it July in Vegas is hot but the air conditioning sucked. We called to get it checked no one showed up to fix it and if they did or didn't I wouldn't know since no one notified me. Other than the air conditioning the room was fine nothing spectacular.
40,We had a wonderful family trip. The room was very nice with a view of the pool. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We rented a cabana at the pool and we’re well taken care of. Dining at the hotel is a bit difficult with long walks and closed restaurants. Overall a wonderful trip.
20,This hotel has gone way down. Not what it used to be.  I hope they plan to remodel soon. It looks outdated.  Also parking is not complementary anymore unless your pearl or above.  With resort fees at 44 dollars and parking additional it just feels your being charged for everything you can.  Not to mention 1L of water is $10.  Service is average at best.
50,Lakeeda was amazing helping us check in we had a lot of requests and she was extremely patient helping us with everything. Your hotel is lucky to have her as a part of your staff. Wish all staff was as patient as her.
30,Booked a double queen room for a family vacation and was most bothered by the lack of cleanliness in the room. My grandmother was a house keeper in hotels and hospitals for 20 years before she retired and we both noticed that the shower head and tub drained had some sort of build up. We did not get housekeeping on one of the three nights we were there even though the other people in our group did receive it every night. The room was spacious and the beds were comfortable but the lack of cleanliness made it difficult to fully enjoy the experience
40,We were disturbed on 2 nights of our stay. Around 2am the first night there was excessive stomping noises and repeated door opening and closing sounds that woke us up in our sleep and persisted for about a half hour. Called front desk and security was alerted. Noises stopped momentarily but continued again. Impossible to get a good night sleep due to loud conversation and stomping. It also seemed as if kids were running in the hallway making noise repeatedly and removed key card access covers and threw them on the ground.
50,This is a great hotel at the end of the strip. Amazing staff. Just wished more restaurants were open more hours. Would highly recommend this hotel and casino. We will definitely be coming back in the near future.
50,This resort has EVERYTHING ! It is a resort for the FAMILY!  It has everything you’d want to possible want to do or eat. There are lots of swimming pools tram access you can shop from stores inside Mandalay or go to other shops casinos restaurants without even going outside of the building NO TRAFFIC NO DRIVING!
30,Bathroom was filthy so we asked to be moved. Second bathroom was also dirty we had to clean ourselves. It seems they may used a charcoal cleanser to clean sink and tubs because there was black residue all over. The AC in room was not cold. The tram to the strip was closed. Hand sanitizers removed and were not accessible in all areas of the casino. Lastly they charge $50/day to store personal items in the fridge. What hotel does that? For what we paid to stay we should have been able to use the fridge for free.
40,The one thing I can say that would improve Customer experience is having more available late night. I also feel more should be included in the VIP experience. It was ok but I definitely feel I was slighted. Especially because I had late arrival.
40,Trip was for my wife’s 41st birthday celebration. Hotel is elegant and very nice but it is lacking food court options which tailored to a healthier environment. Most restaurants were under construction but the actual hotel and rooms were above satisfaction. With all the new more modern hotels on the strip this hotel tends to tailor to an older vacationer. Casino floor staff was great and very clean. Minor cigarette smell in the casino slots area. Overall I give it a 7 of 10 mainly due to the food options.
40,Overall experience was good. I wanted to be close to convention so Mandalay was perfect for that. The restaurants were good and the proximity to the other casino was ok. I like the arena being right there because I wanted to see the games.
20,The rooms were hot Had mine set to 65 and still never cooled off. People in the elevators were complaining how hot the rooms were. Called maintenance and they came up and bent the vent around but that did not help. Breakfast for one eggs 2 bacons potatoes coffee and water $52.00
20,This was our 30th wedding anniversary  We arrived at 1:00 in the morning to a rude a cranky staff.... Not just to us but we observed their rudeness to others..  You may think the room was clean....but it was kinda gross....when was the last time you shampooed the carpets?......or the furniture?  We are coming back to Vegas again....but probably a different mom location
50,I always enjoy staying at Mandalay Bay/Delano. Any issues are always solved within minutes. If there is a problem with the room I typically get a resort fee waived. Some people may not like the location because of how far south it is on the strip. I love it because it is one of the first main hotels/casinos that you arrive to from the airport.
20,I arrived and upon entering my room it had bags of linens garbage and a rollaway bed. When I requested my room to be clean I left the room and came back 5 hours later and it still was unclean. I called and requested extra pillows and was told there were no spare pillows. Asked for a fan and was told there are no fans provided.    Restaurants were closed late at night since I arrived late so I had to buy food from the market which seems strange you can't have a single restaurant open in a 24/7 casino. I was told to use room service which I found was closed also.    Midweek when the pool wasn't busy I couldn't sit near the beach pool on a red chair or use an umbrella because it cost $375 for 2 chairs and an umbrella.    Overall I wasn't impressed and won't be staying at Mandalay Bay again.
20,Room was not cleaned well and sink/shower was not cleaned. The shower and sink were clogged. Plumber did come to repair the sink but it was still draining slowly. Normally very satisfied with our stay but this time was very disappointing
50,Second trip here and neither time did it disappoint. Shops are abundant and varied. Restaurants are all amazing. Definitely need to eat at StripSteak. I think that if the conferences I attend here were held at a different casino I would consider staying here anyway
20,Very slow check in with no explanation or apology. Room ready at 4:15 pm and check in is 3 pm. No water in the room and it was > 100 degrees outside. The front desk transferred our call to in-room dining and we were told the water is $20 a bottle. Not the Mandalay Bay we remember. We will choose another hotel our next visit to LV.
20,The resort was under major construction which was not disclosed upon booking. The hallway smelled terrible as if there had been some sort of spill or water damage that had occurred. Drink prices are outrageous.
40,I love this property and maybe the attention to detail is due to COVID but to have a room where the TV and the phone do not work and it takes over 4 hours to get someone to fix it just is not 4 star expect that from a Motel 6...
20,Multiple service and room function issues no real concern or rectification from the staff. And don’t try to put a bottle of water in the only mini fridge in your room as it will result in a $50.00 charge.if you decide to look in the minibar be sure not to touch because if you move anything it will automatically charge you. Not sure what the resort fee covers if there is no free water in the room(10.00 per bottle) and the 2.00 floats for the lazy river cost 25.00. I don’t mind paying a lot for quality but this was not it.
50,Staff and accommodations were great!. Felt like I was on an island in their pool area. Highly recommend if you want to disconnect. Rooms were very clean and the staff were personable. Casino was fun and lots of variety of games.
40,The rooms were okay. Wish we would have won something. Staff was friendly the 18th floor smelled like piss. And there was always trash in the hallways from guests. The pool was great! Getting the coordination for check out was a confusing due to the limo scheduling. Market was priced really high. 2 bottles of water for $11!
50,We were told we were the first large-scale convention at Mandalay since COVID. First the staff were exceptionally friendly and genuinely grateful to be back to work. I was expecting there to be some glitches thinking they might have gotten a little rusty during the lockdowns but the machine was as well-oiled as ever and very smooth. Next the facility is top-not and there are lots of options for dining and entertainment. There is some small remodeling construction going on near some of the restaurants but I'd classify it as a minor inconvenience at most. Some of the shows in town have not reopened yet but I don't go to the shows anyways. Only mentioning because I know some people do go in for that. Check ahead of time to make sure the show you are interested in is open.    In summary don't be afraid to go to Vegas for business or pleasure. I'm happy to recommend Manadalay Bay.
50,Attending a work conference. Room was very clean and comfortable. Appreciated the ability to precheck and checkout option to avoid the long lobby lines.Had some minor issues with elevators cards not always working had overheard other guest with same issue getting to their floors it was a VERY busy week with Two conventions so may have played a part. Staff was very friendly. Lots of construction going on this week but was obscure from visitors. While this it did limit the dining choices within the hotel due to MB's central location there were plenty of other options nearby. It was a good trip.
10,Check in delayed over 2.5 hrs rude hotel staff poor communication no A/C in room and then moved to a room with poor A/C…who wants to keep moving rooms on vacation so we didn’t request another change of rooms
20,The pool was the draw and the only reason I stayed there since we had friends meeting us there . The a/c in the rooms was pumping out cold air as best it can I guess ( it was only 103 outside ) but we were hot at night hard to sleep. The pool was a huge scam with the chairs and umbrellas it was 125 for chair and another 125 for a umbrella since there’s no way youd last out there laying in the sun the sand so hot it burned your feet. The service we got for food and drinks was good I must say so good job on that . If you want a cabana you have to book wayyyy in advance. The casino floor was not full of machines like in previous years and the first couple night they just took our money not even one bonus . The last night was better but after spending thousands of dollars the casino wouldn’t comp our food and beverage so even tho the room was free we will not be staying here again going back to Wynn or ceasars
50,Don't come here. It's less crowded than other strip hotels and that's the way I like it. Live music spa beach poker tournaments buffet (although not now) restaurants tram gets you to other places...what's not to like?
40,The lazy river and pool make it all worthwhile. Rooms are clean and nice my only issue was the a/c working but not being cold enough. The check in took along time and we needed to wait an additional 2 hours to have access to the room
20,Moldy shower dirty rooms (moved into 2 rooms) empty fridge dirty beds and AC going out in both rooms. Elevator inconvenience takes 20-30 mins to get to your room. After checking out of room we had to take the stairs from level 10 down to the main lobby because our lobby was filled with 30 plus guests waiting for an elevator. Very disappointed in our stay.
30,It was fun but super expensive. A bottle of Fiji water in the hotel room was 20.00. A bag of donuts was 9.00 at their convenience store. I’d say that’s price gouging.. I can’t believe they can get away with that.  The rooms were nice though and the hotel staff were nice Enough. The restaurant Ri Ra was awesome! Go there for sure.    We did have a coupon for My Vegas slots though. The wouldn’t honor it even though I called when I got it it wouldn’t work on the site called the concierge and she said just to bring it in get voucher from m life and it would be added to my reservation. Nope. So don’t waste your time with that. The lady next to me in line was having the same problem.
50,This is one of my favorite properties. Rooms are good pools are great. Daylight is my favorite day club. The only thing I would like to see is more high limit service. Overall a solid 8 out of 10 great time.
30,Rooms and housekeeping isn’t as good as previous years. Bathroom needed additional cleaning upon arrival. Wifi in room was horrible so had to request resort fee refund. Tub had a constant drip they couldn’t repair until we left. Room view and size was great. Comfortable beds and pillows. Great pools and quiet casino with goood priced tables.
30,"My family and I stayed at the Mandalay Bay the last few days of a long trip so the we could unwind and enjoy the pool. Our disappointment began the moment we pulled up the lack of staff was noticeable! We have been to other Las Vegas hotels before and understand that we are just coming out of a pandemic however; if you can't take care of your customers do not take the reservation! The beach was the high point of the stay! ""Cool"""
50,Love Mandalay Bay. Great relaxing atmosphere. Pools are great and plenty of restaurants to enjoy. Extremely friendly staff. Great location. Right across from Allegiant stadium. Definitley will be back.
50,We try to get away to Vegas at least two times a year as an all girl get away. Love going to the Mandalay. Food shows and of course lots of shopping. I would recommend this place to anyone. We are a group of 10 women and we have been going to Mandalay for several years now.
10,Don’t touch anything in your room  They charge you for just relocating the items  $50 service fee $20 per 1L bottle of water  Crazy never going again. Mini fridge use is $50 if you want to store YOUR THINGS in there. Pool opens at 8am but closes at 7pm  WHAT……. Ppl never sleep and it’s 90 degrees plus well passed midnight and they close at 7pm wow…. If it’s two ppl on your stay it’s $450 for 1 umbrella 2 chairs… do the math… cabanas are cheaper if more than 3 ppl …. But reserve when you book your stay
50,Two small issues...First if you pay for parking at a MGM property you can park at any MGM property on the strip. I wish someone would have told us that bit of information. The nice people at Bellagio did tell us about parking at other MGM properties. Second we wanted to purchase Mandalay Bay logo shirts or other souvenirs. No one could tell us if or when the gift shop opened.
50,was a incredible experience the rooms are big and super comfortable and has a good view to the strip the wave pool is super fun my kids love it. Also it has good restaurants and a great casino and shopping place
30,Paid for vip experience. Suite was not ready until 6:30 pm. Not sorry or comps give. Had a 2nd suite where water was pouring down from a light fixture. Still no sorry or comps. Staff is friendly. No bartender available for room service drinks.
30,Hotel and accommodations were nothing special. Thought the hotel was pricey although the pool/beach was great the pool side drinks cost was outrageous. Manadaly Bay is a nice hotel with lots to do but very pricey
50,great place for a nice get away. Clean friendly and attentive to our every needs. Definitely coming back.  Thanks for a wonderful weekend. The casino pool and restaurants where very clean and first class.
10,"We are seasoned travelers to Las Vegas. We have only stayed at Mandalay Bay a couple of times for conferences being held there. Unfortunately this conference was during a heat wave. You would think they would be prepared for that but sadly no. We got to room #1 after flying across the county. The outside temp was 116 there was no air conditioning in the room. We tried to deal with it but finally called an engineer. He came changed the filter etc & when he left we were hopeful. Just as we started to relax the 2 dogs in the room next door started barking. And continued barking. I went into the hallway to see which room it was coming from & saw housekeeping. They told me to call downstairs which I did. Moments later there was a knock on the door & a housekeeping supervisor was there. Her entire right hand was bandaged and she said she had been bitten by a dog in the hotel the day before. We changed rooms and.....no air conditioning again. We tried to live with it for 24 hours then again called engineering. This time he checked the vents on the windows (who knew these windows had vents?) they were open and pouring hot air into the room. Still after those were taped shut the room never got below 75 degrees. We ordered room service on our last night there. $90 for cold food delivered to the room in a bag. Absolutely terrible. Anything you need in the ""market"" is 4x the price you expect. Same for the food court. You cannot use the fridge or coffee maker in the room unless you are prepared to pay for the privilege. I know this is the policy for the fridge in many hotels but the coffee maker? Our room key which also activates the elevator was turned off the day before we left. My spouse was dizzy from a diabetic issue and couldn't get upstairs. We spent 4 nights in a dark room with all the drapes closed too try to keep it cool eating terrible food. I've stayed at quite a few & I recommend ANY other hotel in Las Vegas than this one."
40,Great hotel experience overall. Staff was wonderful. Rooms were clean. The beds were so comfortable my husband and I plan to purchase the mattresses for home. Room amenities were very pricey as well as room service and there is a $50 fee to use the fridge. Hotel is on the end of the strip so plan accordingly if you have mobility issues.
20,Hotel is really going downhill after Vegas reopened “COVID”. First impression door key scanner was broken. It wasn’t just my room saw several others as I walked down the hall. Broken door handle to the bathroom. We had several rooms and the AC was weak in each room and we had thermostat on 65 and didn’t cool down the rooms at all. They were also very stingy on their towels. Upon check in they gave 2 bath towels and that’s it. No hand towels or wash cloths. When I finally found housekeeping and said they didn’t have any. Next day I checked another cart and same thing. Even the towels that they did give were very thin and worn out.    I know they are trying to make back their money but definitely not worth the stay being that the rooms were very expensive that weekend and definitely the hotel has gone downhill. Hotel is severely understaffed. Was on hold for 20 minutes just to ask for towels.
30,Terrible service. Couldn’t even send emails so had to check out early. What kind of hotel doesn’t have reliable WiFi?  Sink was clogged and all doors inside room made so much noise. Lots of construction going on.
40,Last minute girls trip. Great pools. Long walk from self park to rooms. Bring a wagon. Clean rooms. Cocktail service for casino was a little scarce. It was nice to just get out again. But it is expensive!
50,Amazing customer service. Very clean. Probably the most comfortable hotel that I’ve ever been in : ) Every member of the staff was incredibly helpful and went out of their way for us. The beach and pool or just the best!
10,Booked a “King Suite” and “Adjoining Queen Double” for a four night stay 07/08/2021 departing 07/12/2021. Booked through Suiteness for $5600 + not inexpensive. Traveling from a delayed departure out of Boston we arrived at Mandalay Bay at approximately midnight to be informed that the adjoining Queen Double wasn’t available because it had yet to be cleaned! This was a full 8 hours past our check in time of 4:00 P.M. THE PREVIOUS DAY.    Couldn’t get our boys into their room until nearly 1:00 A.M. local time roughly 4:00 East Coast time. Totally unacceptable.    Additionally we weren’t supplied with washcloths or hand towels during our stay and were informed by the house keeping that there were none.    Just awful. We were very disappointed and had expected so much more.
10,What was once a premier Vegas property is now an overpriced Comfort Inn. It’s like they laid off the entire staff during the pandemic then didn’t bother to staff up for the reopening. Save your money.
30,Shower handle was falling off and barely working    Phone stolen from gaming floor and security refused to review the cameras to see who picked it up. Loss Reporting system is slow to respond and lost and found did not answer calls.    removed makers mark from comped drink list    Monday night at 11 pm every restaurant in the hotel was closed seriously in vegas?    entire hallway on 14th floor smelled like mold as i stepped in a puddle from a leaking ice machine    reserved a king bed and strip view and was told when I arrived all you had was a double queen and a stadium view. What's the point of reservations if you don't hold the room?    10$ for a bottle of water when you tap takes like a swimming pool? Even holiday in express gives you free water...
50,Mandalay Bay has always been our go to spot for our anniversary. The rooms are always clean and the staff helps when ever you may need something. Our only complaint was we needed a later check out till 3 so we could enjoy the pool before our flight and they could not accommodate. Kevin at Moorea is a great host. He has gone out of his way several times to make our trips incredible.
50,"I could only give ""Service"" very good rather than excellent due to a rude Representative at check out desk. It was my turn in line to be serviced when the next available staff proceeded to assist a person that appeared at the desk out of no where rather than assisting me as it was my turn to be assisted. The manager attempted to right the staff wrong rude inconsiderate behavior."
20,If mobile check in actually worked I would recommend. However because I had to deal with guest services representatives that are rude and have extremely poor customer relations I would not recommend.
50,Please see previous answers. I absolutely love Mandalay Bay. Please try to make the rooms colder somehow it was uncomfortable to sleep at night but we didn’t wanna make a big fuss as we were there for UFC event . Thanks for a great stay.
20,Admittedly I do not go to Vegas for fun only for business. I've stayed at Mandalay Bay before and the hotel is about the same as it's always been though many restaurants and shops are closed. More imporantly the lack of COVID standards makes it a very dangerous place. Too many people without masks and no one is confirming actual vaccination status. It's a potential super-spreader just by it's very existence. Don't go unless you're vaccinated and even then get a test when you get home.
40,Check in was a breeze. There was an issue as to how my reservation was listed but it was found with very little trouble and our keys were printed and we checked in. Room was very clean modern cool and large. No complaints there. There was one member of our party who had AC issues but were comped $100 and then given another room the next day (which was much cooler). Our coffee maker quit working halfway through on the first day. It was promptly replaced charge came off of our bill and we were comped $50.00. Customer service very good. Restaurants were mostly open and available. Pricey but on the strip that's what you get. The pools were great. Not sure how they kept them cool during the hottest days but it was very refreshing. Our party got a cabana for two days and it was nice. Expensive but nice to have. Seabreeze and Lupo favorite restaurants. Even spent the money to see the sharks! I liked it. Do not fret over bad reviews. You can't please everyone.  My only gripe would be the location. On the end of strip but it was easy to navigate the tram and monorail to get to mid strip. Taxis were also reasonable.
30,Hotel is very nice rooms are great clean and nice but the pillows are terrible causing issues with sleeping. It may be because of the end of the pandemic but it was packed with long lines everywhere the wave pool and lazy river were extremely crowded chairs scarce and any single seat was in full July sun. Overall a nice place to stay but try and stay off-season to avoid cattle like lines everywhere.
20,Hiked the national parks for a week in Utah with the family and hoped to end our vacay in a swanky Vegas hotel. Splurged on the 2 bedroom suite at Mandalay Bay and was assured there would be 2 cots in our room upon arrival. There were none. Requested twice and finally received one. Requested several more times and never received the other leaving one child to sleep on the floor. Also a/c didn’t work well in one bedroom making it quite uncomfortable. Requested service twice for this and never received. We still made the end to our vacay super fun with lots of shopping and the Blue Man performance but the hotel experience was a bit disappointing.
50,I didn't encounter one associate during my 3 night stay that wasn't cheerful and helpful. The place was beautiful and well maintained. Overall the Mandalay isn't cheap but it isn't overpriced. One downside: if you go to the convention center bring a sweater.....
20,nice place but they didn't miss a beat to get into your wallet. long walks to anything. half restaurants closed. huge construction area in several walkways making it hard to move around and crowded..
40,If you do come to Vegas with children this is the resort to go to. Pool is amazing and with a wave pool and lazy river it would be the place I'd go to if children were with. Still as an adult I really loved it!
50,Rooms are very spacious and high quality with large bathrooms that include a shower and tub. You could stay on-site and be thoroughly entertained for days with pool area aquarium arena events casino shows and dining.
20,Lots of issues WI-FI very poor TV Didn't work could not use phone app to open door or use elevator and casino games so tight you couldn't even get a bonus game. In room there is no refrigerator for the guest to use to keep anything cold and they charge a huge amount if you try Overall was not a very good business trip and will not recommend it again. Would not stay their again.
40,Could not get room cooler than 74 degrees. Bathroom door would not stay closed. Chairs in room had visible previous stains. Bed was a bit uncomfortable. Only complaints other than that service was great. Staff was friendly and hotel overall was inviting.
40,Very clean hotel need more staff to assist with customer issues and busy times. Signs around the hotel were hard to navigate we got lost so many times. Hotel’s digital keys were a joke…never worked correctly. Save yourself the trouble and get a card key!
10,AC didn’t work in 120 degree weather. They sent someone up 4 times and it never got fixed. Had to leave in the middle of the night to another hotel. Service was terrible 15 min wait when you call the front desk
20,Front desk not knowledgeable in using a company credit card on file. Couldn’t use in room refrigerator for items purchased in the hotel. Toiletries were very minimal. for the nightly rate at this hotel this is extremely unacceptable. I will NOT stay at this hotel again.
10,This was a free room but I wouldn't want to spend my money here anyway spend my money here anyway regardless if it was a free room or not it's actually don't want anybody is want anybody to have an experience I have
50,Overall Mandalay Bay did wonderfully the cleanliness and beauty of the property was top notch the smell they pipe in was as delightful as it was last time I was there 3 years ago. I brought my kids for the first time and they loved the pools. My only complaint Covid is over the entire town was sold out the main restaurant needs to go back to 24 hours and the buffet needs to be reopened beyond that it was amazing.
10,Host didn't make reservations for shows. Hotel is way under staffed for full occupancy. No towels for most of the stay. Called to get more towels and was told hotel didn't have any. AC didn't work well. Suite was 75+ most days.
50,We had the best time. The staff the room and the pool were excellent. Had a super fun time in the casino as well. Tried out the Noodle House for the first time and their staff is amazing as well. Definitely recommend.
50,Mandlay Bay was clean and has nice pools. It had many good restaraunts. Staff was friendly and while it was not the most convenient location on the strip the monorail service worked out very nice for us. It does however have a great location next to Allegiant Stadium.
30,The A/C was not cooling to the desired temperature and one of the bathroom doors will not close so there was no privacy if you take a shower. Called Maintenance immediately but did not respond til a day later.
10,"Upon arrival to our room it was no vacuumed bathroom sinks had toothpaste and hair in them. The floor manager tried to correct but still gross. Then the WiFi and TV weren't working for 3 days. When trying to reach the front desk no luck via phone. In person you have to wait in the long lines at check-in counter. They did try and make it up by crediting some food and 1 night but we lost a day of work due to no WiFi. When we called the second day we were told they would be happy to check us out. No option of moving to a different room b/c they couldn't verify WiFi or TV would work. Horrible. My children along with us were disappointed to say the least. The pool has no shade unless you rent chairs/lounge which we were happy to do but none were available; however each morning from 8-12 when we were there most of them were empty. Tram does not run 7 days a week. House of Blues food was average. Seabreeze cafe for in-room dining would have been great had they made sure to include the ketchup I ordered for the chicken tenders for my child...however they didn't and by the time we got it the food was ice cold. The Beach Bar Cafe...don't waste your money over-priced horrible service and the $12 ""tropical smoothie"" was really just frozen Orange Juice. No mustard given with hot dog and server never came back to check on the meal. We had to stop a lady cleaning the tables to go get it and again cold food by the time we had it. Citizens was the only saving grace to our stay at Mandalay Bay. Food portion size service was all excellent. Next time we'll stay at the MGM or Bellagio b/c the wave pool wasn't worth all the trouble we had. Kind of a bummer for our only summer vacation with the kids."
50,When we visit Las Vegas we continue to stay at the Mandalay Bay the service is fantastic and the value of the room is very good. We were in town this time for the Garth Brooks concert and their signage for how to walk to the stadium was very helpful.
30,The hotel and pools are great. Housekeeping skipped cleaning our room one day and we were told they were overwhelmed by the large amount of check ins. Couldn’t get the right number of towels for 4 people in a room. No hand towels because the company in charge was not back 100% from COVID. Parts of the hotel are under construction and some restaurants aren’t opened yet. The AC is our room was not cooling great several days we work up hot. Hallways had glasses and garbage thrown in front of rooms. It felt like a cruise ship at times. I’m sure it would be worth it if it was staffed 100% but for now there a few hiccups I wish I would have known about.
50,It was a very enjoyable family get away and just what we needed. The staff at the resort was all so friendly and the rooms were by far the cleanest ones we’ve encountered while staying on the strip. The rooms are a little on the pricey side but I think it’s definitely worth it
50,So many things to love. Checking in on the app prior to arrival so I don't have to wait in the crowded lobby is great! Just stop by to make yourself some keys before you head up the elevator to your room. I can't seem to get the app to work as an elevator key. Possibly user error?... Anyway I love the spacious rooms and the big soaking tub in the bathroom. Clean and staff is always friendly. You can't beat the pools at the Mandalay Bay. The wave pool lazy river and many more pools offer a spot for everyone to relax.
30,Overall experience was disappointing compared to other MGM properties I’ve stayed at this year. I would have imagined they’d have more staff and their amenities open this long after COVID. Mandalay Bay has definitely fallen from the previous expectations that they would have met in the past.
50,We were unsure about where to stay in Las Vegas with two teenage boys on last night of what was mostly a hiking vacation to Bryce and Zion. Mandalay Bay proved to be a good choice. The pricing was a little confusing; but just figure the 'resort fee' of about $40 is part of the hotel room price. We enjoyed the pool complex parking was easy (and only $15) it's close to the airport and at the end of the strip. Room was large clean and comfortable; view was great; wifi signal was strong; and staff at check-in was very helpful.
50,My Mandalay Bay experience was delightful. I purchased the VIP package — it was well worth it.  While one can tell Vegas is still slowly coming back from the pandemic shut down Mandalay is definitely ahead of the cure.
20,It was a very nice resort just the little things but important happened to be out that weekend. Our bathroom light was out and it was super dark to use. The ice machine was down in floor 8 with 117 degree weather. And there was no point to check in on the app because you can’t open door with phone only with physical card
50,My family and I take a yearly vacation to Las Vegas every year with the exception of last year. We like to stay a different hotels to find what each one has to offer.  Our stay at Mandalay Bay was amazing! I’m sure we have found our hotel for our stays. It has all the amenities we look for nice rooms great restaurants great service by all and of course a fabulous pool area!
50,Clean and relaxing . Lots of restaurants shops good food . Pleasant . Liked the security. Can't wait to come back and take advantage of all Mandalay has to offer. I was in town for my sons wedding so I was limited on what I could.
50,Room wasn't ready for our 3 pm check in but Maria D our lobby ambassador was extremely helpful and gave a $75 food credit for any restaurant for compensatio. Clean pool lots of lifegaurds for safety and plenty of chairs available. Room service was great and delivered extra towels. 5/5
10,Ice machine broken on floor had to call down for ice refrigerator unavailable which was difficult for me because I am a type 1 diabetic with insulin that needs to be refrigerated. Called down and was told the $50 refrigerator use fee would be waived but I have yet to receive a check out folio so my hope is that does not require extra work and stress on my end tracking and following up on. The shower handle was broken and the water in the shower was either scalding hot or ice cold.
10,Check-in was terrible even though I tried to use the mobile check-in. Not enough towels and no hand towels or wash cloths in the room. No bath mat. Could not use the fridge in the room and if I put our own water in the fridge they wanted to charge us $30.00 a day. Terrible Hotel to stay in
40,Good overall stay clean rooms nice pool not all the food options are open yet so a bit of a wait at most of the options they had. They still allow smoking in the casino so the smell does linger throughout the entire property.
20,Despite checking-in on the mobile app the morning of our arrival (as requested by Mandalay Bay’s welcome email) our room was not assigned to us at 3pm as advertised. When we arrived to the front desk that evening we were informed the room type we’d reserved (and were half charged for in advance) was sold out and not available. We pressed the clerk to speak to a manager for a refund or to find us the room we booked and suddenly they had a room available. The room was not very clean - my husband noticed leaves and dirt on the carpet - but it was late and after driving 5 hours from LA we wanted to sleep. The next day we realized the wifi we paid for with the resort fee didn’t work in the room and in the middle of showering my husband found clumps of long black hair on the walls of the shower (he has short brown hair and I have long blonde hair) - to say it was disgusting would be an understatement. He went down to tell the front desk and they apologized gave a $50 incidental credit and said a maid could come up - he said for them to come at 6pm since we were getting ready for a concert and would be in the room until then. They said no problem and that the room would be fully cleaned and the hair removed at 6pm. We got back to the room at 11:30pm and the room was dirty bed wasn’t made trash wasn’t emptied and worst of all the hair was still there (actually half of the hair was gone - so someone came into the room removed the hair they saw - missing some - and left) - we went back down to the front desk and complained. They said they could clean it the next day but that was the day we were checking out so pointless. They offered to waive 1 resort fee but we insisted they remove both nights fees since the room wasn’t clean to begin with wasn’t cleaned during our stay and the wifi didn’t work. They agreed. We pointed out it was disturbing to not have proper cleaning during a pandemic but the front desk didn’t seem bothered by it. The location was good for walking to Allegiant Stadium for the concert but honestly we won’t be returning when we’ve had much nicer rooms and experiences at Cosmopolitan Venetian Palazzo Aria and Palms Place.
10,We booked 3 nights for our wedding anniversary. Stayed in the Stay Well Floor. I asked for extra pillows and had to call twice. Our shower and tub backed up with 2 inches of water in the shower and brown dirt coming up from the tub. Called maintenance and it was fixed. 2nd night our A/C was not working. Not to mention it was 100+ outside. Called again and they sent maintenance up again. He opened the furnace and the filter was caked with dust. It was disgusting since this is supposedly a Stay Well Suite and we have been breathing in that dust. I loved MB 11 years ago because of the lazy river but I am going to say this is my last stay. Oh and the rooms are dark and hardly any lighting probably so you don't see all the old and stained furniture. Don't bother gambiling the slots are tight. On a positive note Border Grille is still bomb!!!
20,Vacation I get it you are a for profit business. However the experience was not worth a $50.00 fee to use the refrigerator. On top of every other thing we had to pay for at extremely high prices. I would not recommend anyone stay at Mandalay Bay.    Neighbors were also very loud walls could be thicker.
40,Mandalay Bay Hotel Review    First time staying at Mandalay Bay since the early 2000’s. Overall I really enjoyed MB and found our room and the amenities great. We were there for our wedding and the overall experience was great. Still a few hiccups after Covid. Hotel is at 100% capacity but some things are not.    Rooms: modern looking and well maintained. Very clean! Bed was comfortable. Water pressure is the best of any hotel in Vegas. We were near the elevator and ice machine but room was quiet. Did not hear noise for either or people walking down the hall. Be aware of the refrigerator as it is a weighted mini bar any removal of product leads to a charge.    Restaurants: Seabreeze and HOB were excellent for breakfast. Subway is the only place open 24 hours. Pool food (burgers) is awesome!    Excellent service:  1. Concierges - were extremely helpful with booking of cabanas and limos. Helped out and went to extremes to help us when 3rd party transportation did not show up.  2. Valets - helped obtain us a ride for 12 people when our pre-ordered van did not show up.  3. Housekeeping - were so on top of our room. They even made special times to clean our rooms and our guest’s rooms on our wedding day.  4. Cabanas - got these on two separate days and two different types. Rather easy to book and the set up was great. Constant service for water and any other needs.  5. Pool: the wave pool and lazy River are awesome. There are a lot of rules (nephews were not happy with rules) and lots of lifeguards on duty. Wave pool is not constant waves (heard people complaining about this but seriously it is a pool in the desert not Hawaii). Little shade and sand is really hot so plan accordingly.    Some issues:  1. Resort fees - first these are ridiculous. Second we were double charged resort fees had to call to get a refund. Check your receipt for double charges. Fishy!  2. Mlife Rewards - Mlife points for anything besides gambling was not added to our account. Mlife app does not show where points are from. Had to call to find which points were on our account and email receipts to get points (rooms wedding spa cabana etc). Many places we paid cash for was not added and now there is no way to recover to points. Many restaurants would not take Mlife for points and told us to just email the receipt. Really fishy! 2+ weeks after emailing and still no added points.  3. Valet - employees were excellent but very understaffed. The poor valets were RUNNING all the time to take care of guests but with only 2-4 valets it was impossible for them to keep up. Valet wait times for pickup and drop off were often 30 to 60 minutes. Hire more valets! Give them help!  4. Bellmen - same as valets. They are understaffed and it takes 30+ minutes for pick up or drop off. Hire more bellmen! Give them help!  5. Lazy River - bring your own floats for the pool. They do not rent. Purchase is $20 per tube. Walmart is $5 a tube.  6. Check in for cabanas - due to our party coming at different times each person was given different information. Some were asked for wrist bands others were told they stopped using wrist bands due to Covid. Get your story straight.  7. Construction - seriously the casino was closed for how long during Covid. Why start jackhammering after the hotel opens at 100%.
30,I have stayed here several times in the past and enjoyed my stay. This time was a bit different. There is construction going on inside the hotel but the real issue was with the room. The room felt old and tired. Dark colors and the shower dripped all the time. However the worst part was the AC. We had it set to 60 the entire stay and the room never got cooler than 71. During the day the room would get as high as 78. We had engineering look at the AC but it didn’t help. Keeping the drapes helped a bit but not enough. This just added to the old and tired feeling the room gave off.
10,Room booked online was not available and the credit promised for the room change was never applied to my bill. After several attempts in contacting guest services and guarantees that we'd receive the credit it was still never added to our final folio/charges.
50,The only complaint I have is no free coffee in the rooms. You have to pay for EVERYTHING. There are also no mini fridges :( so be prepared to not be able to keep any leftovers. The room was nice with a beautiful view of the strip as promised. Staff was very friendly and helpful.
30,The bathroom in our room smelled very strongly of urine. The room was dirty. We found a flying ant in our bed. We won a jackpot and the casino staff made us feel like we did something wrong by me having a sticker on my ID. Ruined the fun of winning a jackpot
10,Check in was horrible 4 hour wait to check in and almost two hours for luggage and the pool area was just one mad mess ! Do not recommend if you want a bit of relaxation no shade provided felt like a 2 star.
50,Rooms are quiet and look fantastic The staff are very nice and helpful the restaurants are very good pool experience is awesome lazy River and wave pool are fun. You will love your stay at Mandalay Bay. You will not be disappointed.
10,Yes I expect to pay high prices when traveling but 20.00 for a water bottle or 12 for a soda etc… ridiculously overpriced. Can’t use fridge in room unless you pay 50 to open it. Parking was a mess also ridiculously priced. Lightning in bathroom is terrible. Had disgusting stain on our bed comforter. Room temperature never dropped below 73 even though air was set to 65. My only positive was the shower had good pressure. The charges were outrageous. We have been to Vegas several times and we are locals but this was just ridiculous. Ohh want to use an umbrella at the pool 125 and only shade option is with chairs you reserved for 125 ea. This was the generous guest only poolside seating. Yes you can use first come chairs for free all in the sun no shade or umbrellas offered. Bring your own inner tube for the lazy river or buy one from them for 27. Basically zero convenience for guests. We went to the store bought a cooler and two cases of water for our room for less than half the cost of one water bottle in the room.
30,The room AC is intentionally leading you to believe it's doing what you ask but the room will never get below about 75F. I could not sleep. The building is showing wear dirty windows and scraped furniture. Nothing horrible but not what I expect for $500.
50,Casino is great but the kids loved the beaches lazy river wave pool. Shark reef and choices of food and easy parking just made for a great vacation.  Our flight was canceled multiple times staff went out of their way to help us
50,We had a blast at the pool for 3 days with our 2 boys. This hotel has a great option for families given the multiple pool options. There is a wave pool lazy river and other pools all close by in one main area. We also visited the shark aquarium which was really cool and a nice break from the heat outside. I've stayed here a few times in the past but this is the first time I brought my family and we'll definitely come back.
20,The staff was horribly unprepared. 'Digital Check-in?'. Crippled room a/c. Paper straws in drinks are a disaster in 110 F. 2-month reservations at Border Grill resulted in 'outside availability only'.
50,My husband and I's first time staying here. Had a great overall experience. We expected it to be very busy and it was. So we spent a little more to make our trip seamless. We had reservations in advance to every place we wanted to go (i.e. restaurants pool daybed etc) that we never had a problem. Our trip was fantastic. We would definitely stay here again.
10,Tv's never worked room was not clean upon arrival valet took over 2 hours check in took over an hour didn't receive bags for 6 hours and that was after calling and visiting bell hop several times the property itself appears dirty. We could have gotten better service and experience at a Hilton.
10,I was totally disappointed by this hotel. It was the first and last time I’ll stay here. I had problems from the moment we checked in and I could not believe for the price there my charge how run down things were. The TV in our bedroom didn’t even work. High price hotel that is low rent and run down.
50,Wonderful hotel on the south end of the strip. I had a strip view room with an amazing view of the hotels. Mandalay was a great hotel to stay at. The rooms are spacious and clean. The hallways neat and and the staff is courteous.
10,We checked in on 6/11 at around 6pm. We booked 2 rooms that we requested to be connecting. At check in we were told we’d get one of the rooms and the other still needed to be cleaned. They are busy with 1400 people checking out today and another 1400 checking in the next day.  After two hours with the room still not available we went back to the lobby and were told the room was being cleaned and we’d get it soon.  After another 45 minutes later and 9:30pm we call the lobby to find out the room hasn’t been cleaned because someone was in there.  Eventually after waiting for almost 3 hours and variety of responses the manager said the best she could do was to try to get cleaners up to get started with the cleaning.  Basically pay for a room with tired kids that is actually not still available at almost 10pm.  Unfortunate experience so far and have never experienced anything like this before.
40,Great place to stay but I will say that the rooms don’t get cold enough. But it could be due to the extreme heat wave. It was 117 when we stayed there. Otherwise can’t complain about the room. Clean and great view.
50,The casino and hotel are nice. Typically able to get on the tables with reasonable buy ins. Several restaurant options but not for late night. Hazels has amazing coffee. The hotel is not centrally located. HVAC was a little weak in the room.
10,Dates property with 90% of the restaurants closed for remodel or COVID still. Extremely limited options for dining and bars. Go elsewhere. Went to spa at Venetian and just walking through Casino and shops was night and day comparison
30,First off everyone I dealt with was very friendly and helpful.    When I attempted to book a room on the website after clicking on the offer link the calendar showed one rate for a particular day and then almost tripled the rate after I clicked on the date. I called and the woman said that it initially shows the rate for the lowest tier room whether they are available or not.    WiFi did not work. My phone remembered the network from the last time I was there and it automatically connected. I wasn’t able to use it to connect to the internet so the MGM app or anything else that relied on the network did not work until I disabled WiFi. It probably didn’t work because it never brought me through the portal’s sign in page. Often going to 1.1.1.1 in a browser will bring this up but not this time. Rather than mess with it I just turned WiFi off when I was in the hotel and used cellular data.    The digital key worked the elevator the first time I used it but not the second time. I wasn’t able to get up to my room and had to go to the front desk to get a real key. This might be because my phone might have been trying to use the WiFi at the time. Both the person at the front desk and a girl I talked to in the elevator agreed the digital keys weren’t reliable.    It took about 50 minutes for the bellman to bring my bags up from when I called for them.    The toilet seat would not stay up. Great if you’re female. Not so great if you’re male.    There were no hand towels or washcloths in the room. Only two full towels and the mat.    The bottom of the showers are starting to look a little Motel 6. Otherwise the rest of the room was perfect.    Charging extra for in room coffee is ridiculous. You get that for free at 2 star motels.    A $50 fee to store something in the mini bar fridge is also ridiculous.    I'm getting very worried about the level of staffing going down permanently while prices are going up.
50,Wow!! What am amazing concert and an amazing stay at Mandalay Bay ❤️ We had such a blast that we stayed another night and we live in Vegas. The Mandalay Bay Beach was the best and the concert Rocked… Fun Times
40,Elevator only goes to the floor you check in. We have friends and families on other floor I can't attend to so inconvenient. Ice machine is not working. I have to wait for other people to get in different floor in order for me to get ice.
10,We booked our room in May for the Fourth of July we got there early around 1:30 PM and the room was not ready until six or 6:30 PM. The pool was supposed to be open until 7 PM and around 5:50 PM the entire staff rushed everybody out of the pool area so they can prepare for a concert.  I had to continuously leave the pool area or stop what I was doing to go see if our room was ready because staff assured me there was nothing they can do and we just had to wait for a room to be ready. Once we arrived in the room our AC wouldn’t go anywhere under 75°. My sister is eight months pregnant and we literally suffered in the heat all night. All the restaurants closed around eight or 9 PM on the Fourth of July. They have no kid friendly places to dine for families. And the prices at the pool for food were outrageous.
50,Room was beautiful and comfortable. Great restaurant variety. All staff friendly and professional. Bell desk housekeeping and Security. The casino has good mix of old and new slots. I will definitely book again.
50,Kudos to those who continue to provide excellent customer service. Julianna has again demonstrated her commitment to her MLife customers. We contacted her for a last minute trip back to Vegas due to travel changes. Julianna booked us a gorgeous suite arranged limo service and applied an ample meal credit to the account. Thanks again for exceptional service. We love Mandalay Bay Resort.
50,Mandalas Bay can accommodate anything you want - whether one to many frugal to expensive low key to wild - you can find it here. And don't worry about the heat- just hop in one of the beautiful pools surf in the wave pool or glide in the lazy river!
10,Booked and room for $450 a night. Room description says that it’s newly renovated. Got to the hotel and receptionist was not friendly and told us they are fully booked. Gave us a very old room with clogged shower old toilet and very low AC. We weren’t able to sleep due to room being so hot and there was a concert til midnight but the music lasted past midnight! They gave us some credits after complaining but it’s not really worth it. We went there to relax and enjoy but it was the opposite of what we expected!
40,Overall great hotel. Definitely reach out the the staff and services if you have any issues and they will accommodate. I didn’t have a view for the price I was paying and spoke with staff and they changed it. Would definitely book again! Use the MGM apps a lot of suggestions for your trip.
50,Great place to stay even in the 115 degree temperature. Lots to do without leaving the resort. Shark Reef is interesting pools are great cabanas very convenient (but expensive) wave pool lazy river lots to do!
50,Overall positive experience. Enjoyed my time. Elevators gave everyone a hard time. The only trick that kinda worked was that you had to hold the key card and button for a long time- like 30 seconds…..
30,The resort was very busy during our particular stay which made checking in very time consuming. The tram was down our entire stay as well forcing us to pay for a cab (unless we wanted to walk a long way). For the price it's average.
10,Had a group of 11 were told prior to check in that we would all be on the same floor-NOT! We were scattered over 28 floors- Check in is a nightmare no one seems to know what is going on- rooms are sub par bordering on dirty- 2nd day we were there hotel mgmt showed up at my nieces door and said they were there to take their luggage since they were listed as checking out(that took forever to straighten out) and the list goes on and on Would never stay here again!!
50,Had an awesome time at this resort. The room was spacious clean and comfortable. Loved the beach area and lazy river. We had a great time at the shark reef. So many things to see and do here. Can’t forget how friendly all the staff are there even housekeepers greeted you as you walked to your room.
10,Well we found a q-tip with drug residue and a pill next to it and my wife woke up with bites on her legs!so yeas wasn’t happy at all!won’t be staying again we were lucky our 2 kids didn’t touch anything they weren’t supposed to we won’t be staying there again! They didn’t even offer to switch our rooms
10,Check in problem which took over 6 hours to get my room. I checked in at 8PM and did not get into my room until 2 in the morning. Maintenance ran out of towels. The shower drain was clogged. And the air conditioning was subpar at best considering it was scorching hot during July in Vegas. Terrible experience and would NOT recommend.
50,Great attention and service. Best pools in vegas. Everything went perfect from dinner to finding out what places to visit. The staff was very well informed and helpful.can’t wait to go back and take whole family with me.
50,So far Mandalay Bay has been our favorite resort to stay at in Vegas! From the wave pool to the aquarium to multiple dining options we had a blast and will definitely stay here again and again! Our room was amazing as well and the staff is second to none!! Definitely recommend this resort!
10,Hot rooms you have to have your ID just to purchase water even with the app TVs are broken - don’t work and the room service is cold. Inner tubes cost $25 each! The food at the beach is event food and the wait time is 45 min for a hot dog. The customer service is non-existent and if you have to call the front desk expect to wait forever!!!
20,We came hoping for some pool resort time some good food and fun. We got long lines overstuffed lazy river and wave pool waits to just get on the elevators marijuana smells around the campus and some ridiculous pricing for almost everything.
50,The hotel is excellent well maintained and clean. After selling out on July 4th they were also sold out on the 5th and the first room I checked into smelled of smoke. I went to the desk to get a new room and there was a long line but Diane was working the lone with an ipad to help people that did not need to check in she listened to my issue and resolved it within 10 minute by checking me into a new room that was perfect. I loved the wave pool sports book and the casino was always lively with friendly staff. Breakfast at House of Blues was quick inexpenxsive and delcious
20,When we arrived the lobby was full of families waiting for their rooms it was 4:00 PM! Room won’t have a refrigerator available for your own benefit. They charge around $40 extra daily as resort fee(hidden fee) . The Casino is not smoke free which is an absurd these days. Pools were packed restaurants with very limited GF options. Not recommended.
40,Our stay was excellent except for a couple significant issues that I believe the hotel can address without eviscerating them publicly for. Overall while it appeared the hotel was understaffed our experience was nice. Our VIP check in experience was especially valuable and a great resource during our trip. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to avoid the long lines and check in frustrations and start your trip off feeling... well VIP!
50,Don’t wait in line. The mobile check in and app made all the difference. No waiting in lines ever! And access to everything on your phone. I downloaded the app while in line to check in and within a couple of minutes I had my room and a mobile key so got out of line and went to my room!
50,Employees did an excellent job they are very helpful friendly especially at the front desk u guys did an awesome job I know there so many unhappy people come to you guys and u still put the smile and also thank you for the housekeeping for all the hard work for keeping it cleaned the room. I would recommend this hotel to all the people that comes to Vegas!
10,Walls are paper thin. No umbrellas by pool….which is criminal. They only had two stationary and other you had to pay $100 for umbrella and another $100 for one chair! They charge $30 for a tube. $13 for a fountain lemonade. Place was unkempt and not luxurious at all! Mini fridge has those weighted things do you can’t even use it. Even had to pay for in room coffee. Nothing spectacular about this place at all!
50,The room obtained was very spacious and had an incredible view to the strip. Cleanliness and well-kept the room made it easier to get settled down and feel comfortable. The service was exceptional staff members were very helpful and always willing to assist when a concern or question arise. The treatment given by the employees especially housekeeping was very kind and welcoming. We would be staying here once again!
30,I gave my review overall it was a below average stay I realize everything is getting somewhat normal but this was not a good experience maybe the time of year I decided to visit hopefully next time I’ll wait until the children have returned to school
50,Was upgraded to a 2-bedroom suite due to wait on room check-in. Beautiful room. Had a lot of fun on the beach - attended a concert there - was a blast however beach can get crowded early. Try the Skinny Pina Colada - my new fave! Japanese restaurant and Steakhouse - amazing dinners! Had a great super short stay (the only way to Vegas) :)!
40,Bar was short staffed but didn’t cause any delay on getting my drinks. Sports book employees were super helpful when explaining to a 1st time better I won by the way. Chairs in the lounge area were comfortable and the tv’s are always in view anywhere you sit in the lounge area.
10,We had to wait for around 4 hours to get the room assigned. We waited in the lobby and at the end around 3:30 we got the room. It was waiting for cleaning it seems. My last trip i stayed witth mgm grand and they cleaned and assigned the room around 11am itself. Will not recommend staying here
50,Had a great trip bringing my son and nephew out to Vegas for their first time. Pool was awesome for a cabana day! Good gambling options for first timers and for veterans of Vegas. It was clean and the staff was very friendly!!!
10,This hotel has gone DOWNHILL FAST!!! We had a horrible stay!! ... They didn't have our room ready until 8PM so we had to hang out with all our luggage for 5 hours! Once we were in the room our TV didn't even work. We had to call the front desk all night long for them to even acknowledge getting a repair man up to our room to take a look at it. It took 2 days to repair and was finally working the day we checked-out. On top of that they charge for use of everything in their room-- $50 to use the fridge to keep my baby's milk cold. It's RIDICULOUS!!! Mandalay Bay is a WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!! Totally a stressful non-relaxing stay! ... STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!! They are just robbing people of their money!!
20,We stayed at Mandalay Bay July 5th thru July 8th. I love dogs and kids but they do not belong in the casino floor!!! There were dogs and kids everywhere. I watched a dog pee on the floor while the owner just stood there and watched. Had to be careful not to trip over them constantly because people don't control them from running in front of you while walking.. Our room was not ready at check-in time... had to wait over 2 hours. Their slot payout was the worst of any casino I have ever stayed at. The room was nice but house keeping did not leave us any clean washcloths. You can't put anything in the refrigerator of they will charge you $50.00 … Ridiculous!
40,Nice but not well kept rooms and inconsistent house keeping. There were stains on the white blanket towels were stocked inconsistent. The mini bar was not fully stocked. The staff that worked the Valet do not know that the individuals staying at the hotel are charged for valet it does not come with the room. The Valet pick up is done via a machine and the machines would not work. It took 6 tries and going back upstairs to find a staff to get it to work because there were no Valet staff at the machines.
40,We stayed in Mandalay Bay on June 30 until July2. The hotel was beautiful and the rooms were spacious and clean. We had 4 rooms and we were a party of 7. It was pretty crowded but we were able to use the outdoor amenities each day and find lounge chairs. The Lazy River was fun but too crowded. The Wave Pool was pretty good but the sand was too hot as was the concrete around the pools. The prices of drinks and food were too price inflated but very good. The casino was fine but Atlantic City casinos are just as good. The night life was pretty dull. I understand they are just getting back to opening more choices but we all thought that Vegas never sleeps? Finally on our last night there there was a singer in the Irish Pub. Otherwise not much to choose from besides the casino. Overall it was our first time there we had a great time with special friends and we all came home safely.
50,Outstanding pools. Lazy river and wave pool were so fun. Cleanliness  And good food. Guest service was great. Room was outstanding with views of the strip. Shower and jetted tub a real delight. Overall great!
40,Best pool accommodations for kids in Vegas. Hands down. Friendly and professional staff very clean facilities & easy to check in and out. Room key is digital (via your phone) which is really nice. I always prefer Mandalay Bay with or without kids!!
10,Hotel has not hired the cleaning crew it needs to support the number of guests it has. We got our room at 1am there were people sleeping in the lobby with their kids. The room had trash dirty towels and mini bar was 1/2 empty. Hotel manager insisted on charging us for the night we got the room at 1am. Truly disgraceful. There are plenty of better options in Las Vegas.
10,We had a 2 bdrm suite reserved over 4 months ago n we come to check in n they have us waiting stating the room isn't ready it's 4 pm n it turns out they gave our room away  to someone else. Disappointed on how they handled the situation.
50,"My first stay stay at MB and I'm a frequent visitor to LV. Have stayed at the sister property ""Delano"" before but never MB. Massive place. Most places like restaurants and shops are open on the property but not all. Crowds aren't like pre covid levels yet which is nice. Casino is huge and awesome. It's also part of the MGM ""tram"" hotels which is truly a really nice touch. Wish more casino's would put those things in. Makes getting to the other MGM hotels north of MB a real breeze. Anything that will provide less walking is a real bonus in my Vegas book. Pool area is massive as well which is important to my wife & I. Lots of bells and whistles. Need to get there early too or you could be out of luck. Will stay there again."
30,Mobile check in still took 4 hours past check in time to get our room. Staff was not helpful. No wash clothes in room and never was able to get any. AC was not great. View from room was good. Wave pool was nice. Could use some more shade for people out there.
10,This was by far the worst hotel experience I've ever had at Mandalay Bay. I will never recommend Mandalay Bay to anybody traveling to Vegas. As a matter of fact I manage a Facebook group with over 200k members and I am getting ready to write the worst trip report I have ever written about your hotel. The incompetence I had to endure over the past 3 days from your hotel staff was downright criminal. I checked in through the mobile app on July 5th. I was notified by noon that my room was ready (which started out amazing). Tried to look at the room and unpack but the mobile key wouldn't work on any of our phones so I had to wait in line for over 2 hours to have a key printed. I entered our room to find it 85 degrees with no air conditioning working. Also the television was broken for the entire 3 days I was there. I called guest services (after being on hold for well over an hour) to be told they would send somebody up to fix the AC 2 days later still no maintenance or engineering came. Bernadette from Guest relations told me that the tv system was down resort-wide on several floors and it probably wouldn't be fixed in the next few days. She proceeded to tell me she would put a $100 f&b comp on my room for the issues. I called back to guest services and asked for extra towels and a refrigerator for my wife's insulin. I was on hold for another 80 minutes....3 days later those items still never arrived. I had to go to Target and buy a cooler to keep her meds cold. Checked in at House of Blues Restaurant at 7pm to be told they were full. I was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar immediately or wait for a table. I declined and was put on the list to be texted whenever a regular table came available. I was sent a text at 8:45 that my table was available. Checked in at 8:50 only to be seated at the bar because there were still no tables available. If that were the case....why did I wait the extra 2 hours for a table when they could have seated me at the bar 2 hours prior? Worst part was the morning of checking out. I looked at my folio and didn't see the food and beverage credit. I called guest services and was assured by Tony that it was on my account....not to worry. Checked out and moved to the Wynn. Normally when I check out of Mandalay I always receive an emailed invoice by 1pm. This was 7pm and still hadn't received an invoice so I drove back down to your hotel and proceeded to the front desk. I spoke with Taylor (who was very sweet and the best employee I met). She told me that the f&b credit was noted on my account but never applied and it was a good thing I came back or I would have been charged the full amount. She tried for 10 minutes to apply the credit but the system would not let her or her supervisor. She then proceeded to tell me that all she could do was remove the resort fee because the system was not allowing her to process the food and beverage credit. This entire 3 days 2 nights was a complete nightmare for me having to deal and waste my time on the utter incompetence of your employees in EVERY department. Why would they even put me in that room if they knew the television was out? Don't even get me started on the broken a/c in the middle of Summer in Vegas. It's obvious the people who stayed there before me reported the problem and it still wasn't fixed. I have stayed at your hotel numerous times in the past as well as Delano but will never return. I never have this problem at the Delano but unfortunately I believe Mandalay Bay has seen its better days.
30,The hotel was great. The amenities were amazing. I love the pool and our rooms were clean. My complaint is how rude and unhelpful the staff was. My husband and I came here to celebrate 10 years together and I just wish the employees were kinder. The thing that really pissed me off is it took two trips to grab everything from our room in our last day for checkout and when we came back for the second round the cleaning crew was on our room and had removed our stuff like it was garbage. It was 9:30am and I had not checked our yet. I kindly asked for our belongings but that was completely uncalled for and it made me lose trust for this hotel! My wallet was in that bag!
10,Maintenance person in room. For a hour at midnight trying to fix made excuse that storm caused tv issues no storm July 4th weekend tv still broken after repair person in room  Almost a hour calling for support on phone finally had to say get out of room and demand a new room. They gave us a downgraded room  Horrible experience
50,We went to Vegas to celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday. We chose Mandalay Bay mostly because of the pools (wave pool lazy river and adult options) but were told that the rooms were nice and quite large. We were quite surprised at how nice our room was! Very large with 2 separate closets and a nice bathroom with a separate tub and standing shower plus double sink.    Would definitely recommend Mandalay Bay and will choose this resort again!!
40,The hotel is nice and clean!  the rooms need a little upgrade but there good size clean and nice.  Coffee shop Hazel needs more friendly workers because they take a long time for a couple coffee. But overall I recommend the hotel I love there beach.
50,Every employee I encountered was super helpful kind friendly and just a nice person. There was a slight issue with my room however hotel staff helped fix the issue with kindness and professionalism.
30,The location was terrific and there weren't nearly as many people in the casino or on the street as other resorts. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. The pool was nice.    No microwave in room. $50 to unlock the mini frig in the room to use if you want to store personal items - in addition to the room fee and the resort fees.    Self check-in is great for returning customers. For first time guests - no maps of the property no explanation of how M Life rewards works and no indication that each person needs a room key to access the pool.
10,I don’t write reviews generally but I wish someone had warned me. I have been here less than 24 hours and am considering changing hotels. The hotel is full but seems staff is at half. There has not been one positive human interaction with an employee of the hotel yet. Wifi doesn’t work and phone service is spotty. Service providers such as pool and concierge apparently have estimated hours but no earlier than 9 and close at “around” 7. Joseph at the desk could not have been anymore unhelpful or unfriendly. The bed sheets are stained and the rooms are very dated.    I don’t get many opportunities to travel with my 16 18 and 20 year old daughters and my choice of this hotel has already ruined this one. Too many other options to make staying here worth while.
30,"Really nice room with a huge bathroom. However right now very limited food options especially at night. The restaurant row is mostly under construction. The shuttle between Excalibur/Luxor/Mandalay Bay is only working on some days. The electronic features may or may not always work. For example the phone app ""key"" did not work on the elevator. The check out process through the tv did not work. When housekeeping came in they did not empty the trash cans. However the Mandalay Bay did at least HAVE housekeeping each day so that is a plus right now. When things are all open and working this might be great but right now it is just a 3 star rating."
50,I love the pool the customer service the rooms view and appearance friendly staff in fact my family and I are very satisfied with the hotel we’re planning our next trip in a couple of months to celebrate my daughter’s birthday
30,Our stay at Mandalay Bay was disappointing over all. We have stayed at many of the other MGM properties in Vegas and found this one to be the least maintained. Our room had multiple little issues which took away from our experience and showed a lack of maintenance. The bathroom doors wouldn’t stay shut along with shower door and towel hanger missing from wall in bath room with just the mount visible. The hallways always had trash bags next to rooms and the elevator vestibule tile floors were worn and dirty. If you are planning on going to the pools know that there will be a large number of young children at this resort.  On a positive note we payed extra for the VIP experience which included rides to and from airport along with early check in and late check out. No waiting in line well worth the price.
50,My family and I stayed there for 4 days and we could not have had a better time. Our daughters loved the water area and the food was amazing!! We cannot wait until next summer since this is now a yearly tradition. Thank you
20,I got the feeling we were constantly nickeled and dimed. I am a diabetic and when I opened the in room refrigerator there was a sign that we would be charge $50.. a day for storing our supplies there. So we constantly need to go and get ice for the ice bucket so I could keep the medicine chilled.    Also $30.00 for a drink at the Tiki Bar. You gotta be f'in kidding me. I expect to pay a little extra at the bar but 3 times the amount of what I expected. Then you won't let people bring in their own beverage so you have us trapped. Just a joke to over charge like that.
50,Went for one night with my fam (two kids 3 and 7). We got a cheap rate which made all the amenities extra special. Rooms were wonderful (we had a King with an adjoining two queens) pool was perfect food options were alright but it is COVID times so a lot was closed. Still we had plenty of decent choices. Shark Reef Aquarium was expensive but the kids enjoyed it and having gotten tickets ahead of time it was all very easy.
40,Pool cleanliness still needs some help and lazy river needs to monitored way stronger crazy river maybe!! We have been going for years but don’t seem to get any loyalty perks. Even being platinum mlife really meant nothing to anyone.
10,Extremely dirty rooms got switched to a worse room then they couldn’t do anything after that …. Dirty stained sheets eye lashes decomposed rat dust everywhere blood stains on cabinets just a bad experience. Not a place to go for a vacation with all these unexpected events..
10,The customer service was awful. Rude staff and they were also severely under staffed as there were huge lines that seemed to never move causing most people to just give up. Check in is at 3 and even though I checked in online the day before my room was not ready until about 5. When I got in line to find out when it would be ready a manager came to tell me that my room is popular and rudely stated that waiting in line wouldn’t make the process any faster. The bell desk hung up on us. Just bad customer service all around. They really need to get more staff to take the pressure off of everyone.
40,Mobile app check in is easy and I would strongly advice. Do it early and you get your room early.    Everyone is nice and the hotel is excellent. Except for valet. I would avoid in a heartbeat. Took 50 minutes from the time i got to back of the lone to the time the valet opened my door. Average valet wait time is 30 plus minutes. There was one time I waited 35 mins to get my car at Delano where I left it to them telling me I have to go to MB. So I take my family of 5 to MB to get our car. Then after another 30 plus minutes they tell me to go to Delano because my car is there. After over an hour I finally got my car. And the hotel still charged $26 per day. Not what I expected from Mandalay Bay.
50,This trip was with my granddaughter Caylea to watch her volleyball tournament over the weekend. It was a good time all around. The tournament took most of the weekend but we did find time to enjoy the fine dining Las Vegas has to offer.
10,We got ti room and it was not fully cleaned. First night our neighbors were fighting and smoking Marijuana. Security was made aware. I was up all night with asthma ttl bummer. Valet was worst I've ever encountered in Vegas. Wifi was horrible and we rented a movie which buffered all night. We also had a broken sink that dripped all night. They did offer to move us to same room type 15 floors higher! Sooo generous of them.
30,No WiFi or tv for relaxing in the room…pool was great! Also no refrigerator for leftovers or drinks…had to buy a styrofoam cooler for extras… food in the resort was also great… high prices but good food.
10,AC wasn’t working technician came to my room at 1am after I called for the 7th earlier that day. He dusted the filter while I was actually in my bed and dust flying everywhere. No TV they said it was a internet problem for my whole stay but other guest had no issues.
10,"After booking the ""Panoramic 2 bedroom suite"" last November (for visit on the 4th of July) we were placed in a room alike but without the panoramic view. The room had an obstructed view and the floor to ceiling windows were non existent. Our family had to go through 3 hours of phone calls talking to managers and exhaustive conversations just for the hotel to fulfill their side of the deal. The female agent who took the call was extremely dismissive making it sound that nobody had ever complained about the view in this specific room before (please see attached pictures). We were told they were completely booked without any consideration to the fact that I had reserved and paid more than 7 months in advance. After much debating we were offered $300 in compensation (for a stay of around 2K) and just had the worst experience ever in a hotel stay. After we went back to the front desk and spoke to a different person we were placed in smaller suites at the Delano tower. We go to Las Vegas at least twice a year and needless to say the Mandalay Bay has scratched itself from our list of hotels that we would like to come back to. Awful experience."
10,"Reserved the ""Panoramic Two Bedroom Suite - Two Queen"" at Mandalay Bay many months ago specifically so we could watch fireworks with our kids because of the large windows in each room and had paid for a second room for our friends who were joining us. However when we arrived in our room on the 7th floor we found it extremely gloomy with small windows which obscured the little view that was there with Xs in the way. It felt like a prison and was not anything like what we expected or was presented on your website when I ordered. I called down to the desk to be asked to be moved to another room and was told there was no other room till Monday(we were leaving Tuesday) and were given attitude being told ""No one else has ever complained about it before"" and were later informed that they had needed to move other people for a similar reason that day which makes her original statement dubious at best if not an outright lie since I cannot imagine anyone accepting that room. The best you could do was provide a $300 discount which I begrudgingly accepted at the time on the phone. This left a bad taste in my mouth and decided to go to the front desk to see if anything could be done. Here we were told essentially the same thing but were offered another option of being moved to the Delano. While we accepted this it was not what we wanted but at least it was better then the original room. This whole process took three hours gave my wife a migraine and more or less ruined one of the 3 days we were there."
20,To be so expensive I expected more the hotel is very beautiful the pools they gave us the dirty room the staff is very friendly except those of distinguished members that staff have a bad face (I was wrong of place to check-in and she told me this is not the place but I'm going to attend to her) as well as that she was doing me a favor and of course not because it is her job to serve clients even if they are not a VIP client
50,Great service excellent hotel plenty of places to see and shows easy access to the strip easy to get back to hotel as a tram a wave pool swell drink service wide open easy parking easy access to other m life hotels
20,Terrible room condition.  Bathroom towel hanger fell and hit my kid’s foot and she was limping for half a day from the pain.    Dried pizza on the floor from prior guest minor water leaking in bathroom sink etc    I normally have a good experience at Mandalay Bay but this one didn’t go so well.    Requested for connector room and was told to let the staff know before checking in and arrived early at 1pm and front desk denied it and he didn’t even try to offer a different room that may have had a connector.    kids loved the pool though. But the hotel really needs to clean their rooms before checking in new guests.
30,We stayed in a stay well room. The floor we were in did not have the trash removed for our duration. There were cigarette butts and beer cans on the floor by the elevators. My in laws waited for 7 hours to get their room! Digital key was another issue…
30,Unclean room and disgusting bathrooms. Nowhere to get food past 10. Machines were super tight and not customer friendly. We were in and out driving through from a Colorado Springs trip with the family.
10,Not only did we experience poor customer service b also witnessed the casino floor staff be absolutely rude to its customers. I notice that that the poor treatment was directed at Latino families. Not sure if this a practiced procedure or just a coincidence. Would recommend avoidance of this place for a few years until the crap staff circulated out.
30,The room was comfortable & had a great view but there was surcharges everywhere; to include coffee & refrigerator pressure sensors. The later is an extreme annoyance with the vegas summer heat. Staff was friendly.
50,In over 20 years of staying at Mandalay I have only had a few minor issues over all. It is like coming home. Staff are very friendly rooms are always nice. During covid things are closed but that is to be expected. I am hoping when I go again more places will be open and are not shut down for good.
50,We enjoyed our stay. It was a bit crowded due to 4th July holiday. The rooms were a nice size clean. Beds were comfortable. Loved the lazy river and wave pool. Check in line was long but moved quickly. Check out was easily done by our phone. Overall we had a great stay with our family of 4.
30,We have stayed here several times because our family likes the pool. But be prepared to spend lots of extra time and money for amenities that are standard everywhere else. For example they charge $10/cup for keurig coffee in the room and $40/night for a tiny refrigerator. We need the refrigerator for medication so ours was “free” but we waited over 5 hours for staff to deliver it to our room. It’s clear that they want you to go to the casino for every need hoping you will gamble but it takes a long time to get the elevator and walk through the smoke-filled maze just for a cup of coffee. Only the food court has reasonably priced food and it feels like you walk a mile to get there. Except for the pool not a family friendly place.
40,We had a great time but we were disappointed that so much was under construction. It was also hard to find family friendly and pocket kind food that was not either a sports venue or a food court.    The pools and spa are fantastic. The rooms are great.    Lots of fun!
30,"We stayed the week after 4th of July. Hoping to give you some tips for your next stay. Check in was atrocious. Waited in a long line then was happily pulled out of line to do an Express check in. I did that and it went well unfortunately the key card we received isn't connected to the parking garage so we had to get a ticket every time we left. When the front desk line was finally small enough (the next night) the employee knew about the situation and wasn't happy with it either having to stand in line to link the key card. What's the point of Express check in then (unless you flew).    No coffee maker in room I mean kinda. There is a TINY ""keurig"" but no coffee or coffee mugs. So bring k-cups and a mug if you don't want to stand in line at Starbucks in the A.M.    No outside food or beverage inside the pool area. You CAN bring bottled water in and please do as their bottled water is EIGHT dollars!    Tubes allowed in lazy river up to 48 inches. Except we saw two 6 foot rafts which clogged up the river easily. When I asked the lifeguard if those were allowed she said ""um yeah because there's noone here to enforce the rule."" Um you. You can enforce it. The lazy river was so packed you could barely walk into it. Busiest I have ever seen it. Still super refreshing and fun as well as the wave pool!    No portable umbrellas allowed anymore either and no shade so bring a wide hat or buy a tent/cabana. We were at the pool from 8-4 and the cocktail waitress walked by twice. Saw her walking by the cabanas more often. I know they work hard but the people who didn't spend $400 on a cabana would like food and drinks too.    There is a fridge in the room but it's stocked with goodies so if you want to put anything in there to keep cool it says a $50 charge 🤷‍♀️    Vending machine doesn't work on our floor. A guy from another floor came up to get ice on our floor as his ice machine wasn't working.    On a positive note the hotel is beautiful. Beds are super comfortable. Water pressure is good. All of the employees welcome you with a smile and are very helpful."
50,I went to Las Vegas to have some relaxation. Loved the pool area. There was a regular pool a lazy river and a wave pool. All locations were fun. Brought my own tube for the lazy river and I stayed in it over an hour.
20,Restaurant only open 2 at a time paid for early check-in but was finally refunded since it was after check-in time when we got our room. 2 towels in room and one of the $10 coffee kits only had one pod. MGM Grand hotels have really gone down hill since the Covid reopening.
50,Awesome trip had a blast with all couples who joined us on our short trip to Las Vegas NV. Did gambling shows and dinner during our stay at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino. Plenty of walking so go comfortable.
10,I was stuck with no water from 1AM- 6AM my first night. I couldn’t even wash my hands or use the toilet. A very unhygienic situation. Charged mini bar fees and didn’t use any of the items. Broken ice machines. Then management made us feel like it was our fault to complain over their crappy service and property. Still charged us for For things we didn’t use. The pool was decent enough and God bless the bartenders who helped salvage was our first trip since the pandemic. The Mandalay Bay is unfortunately past its prime and after moving to the Palazzo I could never give them my Patronage again. I’ve literally never taken the time to complain online but this place really rubbed me the wrong way. And refused to make it right in a real way.
50,Always super clean and everyone you come in contact with is friendly and helpful. I love the pool and it's nice to walk to other hotels interior. I also love how easy it is to charge everything to your room. Plenty of places to eat and drink and even get a tatoo while you are there.
50,The Mandalay Bay is an amazing location to say in Cegas with Kids! The pool here is one of the best. We rented a cabana for the day and the waitress was so on top of taking care of us! The pool side food was pretty expensive and not a lot but the tide pool and lazy river was fun for the kids!
30,Room was comfortable with good water pressure in shower. Hotel is kind of dark but very nice. I would recommend bringing ice chest and extra water for room. Pool was very relaxing. Food and drinks are over priced at pool
20,Called several times and finally was told nothing could be done about it. They would not move us to another room. They comped the resort fee for 3 of the 5 days. But really our trip was not good considering my teenage son was stuck in the room with no tv and ac that was not working in July. While I was at volleyball tournament with daughter. A reall bummer!!
40,Was in town for a sporting tournament with daughter. We were moved to Mandalay Bay from Park MGM because it was from Group booking of tournament organizers. I found it to be a very nice hotel with excellent beach and wave pool that kids liked. Clean rooms and very professional staff. Little things bug me like not having a trash can in bathroom and telling house keeping every day for 6 days and never getting one. I was told each day I would get one. Call front desk very nice was told it would be taken care of.  Ice machine on 12th floor. No big deal. But your key card will only let you on the floor you are assigned. So go down to 11th floor via steps take elevator up. If you dont think this is important I will tell you why it is. The fridge in your room is loaded with stuff you cannot put anything in it. If you touch or move anything in fridge it is on a sensor you will be charged for that item at a very expensive rate. So run across the street and buy a cheap styrafoam cooler and buy beer across the street at a fraction of what you will pay in the resort. Not a big deal but its a little thing that bugged me. you could also pay $50 to have a small fridge brought to your room.  Yes its all about convenience and you will pay for that.  I did enjoy my time there though understand Mandalay Bay is at far end of Strip its a good 30 minute walk to get to the main part of the strip.
50,My wife and I decided to travel to Las Vegas as a 30th wedding anniversary celebration for ourselves. We selected the Mandalay based on my previous stays there. Once again Mandalay did not dissappoint. Everything was fabulous and I highly recommend this venue for any type of Vegas travel destination. Great casino and just a beautiful property. Everything was just wonderful.
20,Joseph front desk staff was the worst! Treated us like we were street trash. If he waits on you ask for another clerk because he is the WORST!!! He Lacked professionalism. He was Rude sarcastic belittling and uncalled for. When there is an issue management won’t even come out and talk with you to resolve things. This place is no longer accommodating to me and my family. And maybe they don’t care. That’s fine too! Just be aware of what you might be faced with.
30,The property is beautiful and the room was nice. The staff was friendly and helpful. But I was there in the middle of the week and it was packed. The tram was not running which was terribly disappointing to our family.  I was on hold with room service for 30 minutes and never got through so don’t rely on that for food. Also make sure you have dinner reservations or plan on waiting over an hour.
30,I know the name of the game in Las Vegas is to charge for everything but as a guest you get tired of being nickeled and dime to death for everything. To not have a free coffee maker in the room or a refrigerator that could be used for less than $50 is ridiculous the hallways were constantly filled with garbage and I think the pools were dirty. My room was nice but it had not been cleaned well from the previous tenants. I do not want to have to pay for parking and will find a hotel in the future that does not charge. I stayed at the Luxor a few years ago and Mandalay Bay was definitely a step up from that place but if you’re going to charge me $40 a day for a resort fee it would certainly be nice to not have to pay hundreds of dollars for a cabana for one day!
50,The hotel is amazing the hotel it self and the pool unlike some hotels only got 1 big pool and a lazy river but this hotel got more then 5 pools and bigger and the service was great definitely returning there and great price too.
30,the hotel is good but that same time upkeep of the hustle and bustle in the most busiest of holidays was not very good. more kid friendly restaurants and maybe a arcade could be a possibility. no fridge and microwave i know a marketing strategy but some ppl would rather enjor simple things. we stayed in a suite was nice but needed some upgrades.
20,Pool area is literally a sea of humanity. Overstuffed and crowded with Vegas drunks. Chairs are stained and nasty. There are like two umbrellas available at each pool with hundreds of chairs in the blazing sun. The pool area was crumbling and there was blood on the concrete when we entered the area. The rooms are fine. We had a view of the airport. Amenities are minimal. No robes cotton balls or q tips. Worn towels. Generic shampoo and conditioner. Amazingly our sleep was interrupted at 2 am by a full rock band with drums and electric guitars playing on the floor above us. Security promised they were coming but that must have had to climb a greased pole to make it to the 19th floor. The band played four songs before security arrived.    If you are unfamiliar with Vegas this hotel is farther away from the main strip.    Stay at the Bellagio. Bright and airy with beautiful shops and restaurants and clean glittering pools. Mandalay Bay was gross.
50,I traveled here for a one week stay with my 10 year old daughter and had a great time. The service was impeccable. The rooms were super clean. The VIP Arrival package with included limousine transportation was a great add-on.. the pool was the best pool in all of Vegas. The pool cabanas were super nice and had unlimited stocked cold beverages. The Shark Reef Aquarium was very enjoyable to visit. This is a great place to stay. Despite it being Las Vegas I felt super safe and isolated from the busy Vegas Strip. I definitely would recommend Mandalay Bay for anyone bringing kids.
50,Staff is friendly and helpful. Clean and beautiful rooms with plenty of space. Hotel is located on the strip but gives you a break from all the chaos. Has a nice chill family friendly vibe compared to other properties. Over all a wonderful place to stay.
20,Tv didn’t work the entirety of my stay. Gave me f&b credit a few hours before I checked out… tram was shut down and even when it was open the sign from Mandalay Bay said closed which had my lady walk an extra 2 miles
10,Air conditioning didn't work switched rooms and still air conditioning was not good. Could not go past 72 degrees. 90% hotel staff was rude everyday had to wait 30 minutes just to get on the elevator to get to your room. Nothing to eat past 10pm. They lied and said we could get to our reservations for dinners they set up for us when we booked our stay. The tram only runs on the weekends. So it's either walk or pay for transportation or don't go anywhere. Blackjack tables 25 bucks a hand thought I was a high roller on a beer budget. We paid for limo service to and from the airport. The limo looked nice on the outside but the inside of the limo had holes in the ceiling the air conditioning was little to none. Didn't even get a limo to the airport on departure it was an SUV not what we paid for and told what we would be getting. Will never stay there again. Food court closes at 8pm so that leaves house of blues with a limited menu. Or the fountain room for fine dining open tell 1am sorry but if I'm gambling tell 2am I'm not wanting fine dining I'm looking for something quick and easy. The VIP experience package we purchased was more like third class service. The cleaning and maid staff was the nicest people and the SUV driver to the airport was very nice. Oh also the sinks and the shower water was very very slow to drain. Taking a shower with dirty water up to your ankles doesn't make for a clean shower experience. The TV cable or satellite which ever they use was good up until around 1am it would start bugging out. Maybe that was telling me it was time for bed. Little kids running everywhere. Why would you bring little kids to a smokey casino baffles me. Never made it to the pool. No place to sit it was so packed no place to put you stuff. If you want to do the lazy river they charged 25 bucks for a intertube. Not even able to just rent them. What am I going to do with it flying home. They tried charging us for the mini bar coffee. We don't even drink coffee and also a candy bar. The refrigerator was locked the whole time we couldn't even get into it. Over priced and no tram to go anywhere like they said on the weekdays staff rude room subpar and calling the front desk you will be on hold for minimum 20 minutes before you talk to a rude person on the other end. We stayed 5 days and that was money down the drain. Other guest complained about 6 hour check in times. Mandalay bay you got a lot of work to do. Also buffet was closed. We went when Vegas was fully open no restrictions. Motel 6 would have been better and cheaper. Many of our plans had to be canceled do to no way of getting around. We spent 200+ dollars on taxis and lifts just to go do something's we had planned. As far as I'm concerned Mandalay bay you owe me 200+ bucks for the transportation you cost me for not running the tram on the weekdays. Why the hell would you shut the tram off on the weekdays. Makes no since.
50,The hotel was clean not overly crowded and open. We were extremely pleased with the accommodations and the staff! The pool was was cool and refreshing and busy! We really needed a relaxing break! Thank you!
30,The room temperature would not go down lower than 78 degrees. The maid service is available every other day unless you specify (this was not relayed to me at check in) there is a charge for in room coffee (not complimentary) the refrigerator is not complimentary (no room/place to store left over food from restaurant or to refrigerate drinks - even ones purchased on property) the price for a gazebo is $650 on up per day (if one chooses to purchase) and it only comes with 2 inner tubes for the lazy river instead of the amount needed for number of guests in gazebo and/or cabana (very disappointing) massage services non existent at pool side (I asked the masseuse for a massage. He gave me a time of 1:45 pm and never showed up. I asked my host to inquire about the appointment and she never got back to me. I waited another and he was a no show. The services at this hotel get a failing grade. The resort charges are $44.22 per day and I haven’t a clue as to what they are for. Please be for warned before booking a room.
40,Had great time. Best pools in las vegas. Concerts in the pool wave pool lazy river plus 3 normal pools. With the free tram getting to the luxor Excalibur or corner of trop and vegas blvd is quick easy and free.
30,To start the front desk wait time for check in was close to 2 hours! Once we checked in our keys wouldn’t work in the elevator and the Elevators continued to have issues all 4 days of our stay. Restaurants weren’t open mid week. The fridge in the room is not usable due to it being a mini bar. This meant there was no way to plan ahead by bringing snacks or drinks.
40,Overall really good but had some very bad experiences with rude and loud guests. Can service and front desk are very friendly and made the trip overall very enjoyable and low stress.    Pool is nice and Casino dining was very moderately priced.
50,Amazing customer service. Friendly staff. Loved the mobile app and self check in with the digital key. Pool was amazing. Especially the lazy river. Casino is big and lots of games to play and readily available.
10,"Our stay here was so bad! After checking into our first room our wifi didn't work at all. We called the front desk and they said they switched us to a different room and instructed us that all we had to do was go to mobile check-in to get new keys. We were being helped at one of the check in stations by a nice gentlemen when all the sudden a woman named MARIA literally pushed us off the station and said ""THIS IS NOT WHERE YOU DO THIS!"" And she let another set of guest use the station we were currently being helped on. I didn't get it I was so confused. We told her we were being helped at this station. My partner told her she was being rude to us and she had the nerve to say ""I'm trying to help you."" We had been told to go to mobile check in by the front desk someone was helping us and we were literally forced off the station someone was helping us at. Even if that is not supposed to be done there she could have handled it in a much more professional way. The worst part was the station next to us was completely empty and no one else was in line. She made a point to kick us off because she didn't believe people should be going there to get room keys. The nicer gentleman that was helping us did eventually get us our room keys but that experience left us feeling so bad. When I wrote an email asking to talk to a manager or supervisor at the hotel about the situation I never even heard a response."
40,My wife and I stayed at Mandalay Bay for four nights. Our room had a King-Sized bed. The bathroom had a walk-in shower bathtub and two sinks. The room was clean. There were his/her closets. There was a stocked refrigerator but we did not utilize it. In fact if you used the refrigerator for your own items you were subject to a fee. Our television experienced an error of some sort which took the staff two days to come and correct it. We were refunded the $39/day resort fee for the two days. There was no noise from any of the other guest rooms but jet noise from the airport is noticeable and at times is continual. We did not use the pool but it did look good from our vantage point.
50,Room was very clean. Hotel included many many pools the wave pool was exceptional for the Vegas heat. The room does not allow you to use the fridge for personal items. Buffet was not yet open for service. At the market there were no prices on any of the items so it was a guessing game. The casino was one of the best not much smoke in the air and very roomy. The lobby self check in was a breeze.
40,Very big and clean rooms. Great pool with lots of space. Bathroom is very big and the bed is very comfortable. It is towards the end of the strip so on hot days and nights it is a long walk to look at the other properties. I would definitely recommend staying there.
10,I visited the Mandalay Bay this past weekend from June 30th-July 4th accompanied by close friends.  The actual visual of the hotel was nice and it had a few shows that were very interesting.  When we arrived they did let us check In early which was appreciated .Our rooms were comped by Mlife Rewards but we still spent close to $2000 in this casino alone (so free isn't always what it seems!)  The problem came when we checked in the room-the ice machine on our floor broken-we had to travel to multiple floors to get ice-also the fridge had items missing upon check in.The air only worked mediocre at best.  The cost of the items were too expensive  One can of pop $10-Everything in this hotel was expensive-the food in all restaurants were overpriced-ex.6 wings /fries =$25.  Cabanas at the pool start @ $250 and up.  We were never offered to get a new room on another floor and or a free upgrade-which we should have been offered. There is no accommodation to help return to the airport-No luggage caddies or bell hops to assist.The Mlife Rewards Desk line was long all weekend with no available Rewards Kiosks Booths to use  The cards didn't even work half the time.I had free play on it I could not even use. (Not acceptable!)  The only glamorous thing about this hotel is the cost  of it all.I will probably not return.My first time going to Vegas was not what I expected.
50,We stayed at Mandalay Resort. The hotel/casino was beautiful and busy. There was a softball tournament in Vegas and some of the teams stayed there. Nice workers beautiful pool and wade pool. We loved the aquarium stripe steak and house of blues. The stores inside the hotel and the attached stores were very nice. Bring your money!!!
40,"The big draw to Mandalay Bay is the excellent pool/wave pool/lazy river area and it's enormous convention center. There is a $20 charge to use the pool and it was crowded. You need to get there early for choice of lounge chairs or you could reserve a chair ($75-$125) a round beach day bed ($375+) or one of several cabanas starting at $525+.  During my stay there was major renovations occurring and not quite sure which shops / restaurants were open due to this.  I arrived late night (11:00 pm) as were others and the ONLY place to get something to eat was a SUBWAY that you had to walk three-tenths of a mile to get to. Lots of folks were dragging themselves and waiting up to 30 minutes in line for a sub sandwich.  Be prepared to bring your own inexpensive drink of choice as 1-liter bottles of water in the room costs $20 and you are charged for the coffee you make available in the room as well.  Rooms have been adapted to accommodate more plugs/USB ports for the current needs for recharging electronics.  If there is a certain activity you want to experience at the hotel...be sure to call in advance to see if services are available. I wanted to used the Spa but only services like hair styling or massages were available. The ""spa"" with sauna whirlpool and other relaxing agents were UNAVAILABLE to guests at this time.  I did like the fact that the Shared Ride (UBER/LYFT) area was readily available downstairs by using an elevator/escalator just a 2 minutes walk from the lobby and hotel room elevators.  I believe Mandalay Bay has seen its heyday as it's now one of MGM's older properties on the strip. It's a great hotel for families with the pools and eateries for burgers subs and hot dogs. Saw many families crossing the Blvd to the McDonalds and bringing back Happy Meals to the hotel. lol  There wasn't a lot going on at night that I could see. And I looked. The party goers seemed to be returning from elsewhere via cab/uber rather than partying at the Mandalay Bay.  The hotel staff was excellent across all areas from front desk to casino to the restaurants.  I would stay here again if the rooms were in the $100-$150 range again."
50,We love the Mandalay Bay. The beds are very comfy. The rooms are spacious. The pool/beach area is awesome. There were several shops and restaurants not open yet but there is a mall connecting Mandalay with Luxor that had lots of options. It was a nice getaway from our 4 kids.
50,We liked that we could take a tram from the MB to Excalibur when needed. We loved the room! I haven’t slept so well in a while! I also loved all the pools. They were fantastic! The lazy River is incredible and you can bring your own floaties. There was something for everyone in my family here!
10,We usually stay at Mandalay Bay or other Mlife properties when visiting Las Vegas.This is the very first time we've had any issues. The afternoon we checked in we discovered a pair of dirty underwear in plain view in the closet. OK so that can happen no big deal it's a one off...but then the morning we departed I found roaches in our suite by the mini bar and that is a big deal!!! Pretty shocking cleanliness considering our previous experiences at the resort have all been excellent...I have pictures if anyone from the resort monitors these reviews.
30,If arriving on a later flight eat before arriving at Mandalay Bay Resort. The restaurants and all but 2 lounges were closed. We paid for a resort and got a casino with a room. Yes there was some construction but every restaurant was closed We had no running water when coming back to our room because of a maintenance problem and when we asked about it we were told to use two bottles of the normally charged water to clean our hands and teeth.
40,Were nice rooms. Sink issues (clogged). Table minimums higher than other. A little smoky. Still had construction going on in some areas. Great location on strip. Needs a few more waitresses around. Give it a A-
40,"I love Mandalay Bay! There is not a better pool in all of Las Vegas. The layout of the Casino and room towers are very convenient. You don't have to walk throughout the casino in your bathing suit to get to the pool. Front desk Casino Pool and Spa all a short distance from the elevators. I have been coming to Vegas regularly since 1994 and whether due to the pandemic or casino groups getting cheap there were quite a few changes that I wish I knew about before I got there.  1) Parking: For the MGM Resorts you will be charged for parking. $14/day for self park and $26/day for valet. Gone are the days when you can valet and only have to tip your attendant. We decided to splurge for valet. What was nice was that the one fee was reciprocal at the other MGM sister properties. However the system is new and the employees have not been trained on how it works and more than a few times the automated kiosks would attempt to charge us twice per day. When a kiosk would ask for another payment we would cancel transaction and go to the valet manager and they would always have our car brought up the old fashioned way. Also we noticed with everything Vegas is back up to 100% capacity but EVERYWHERE is operating with 50% of the staff - if that in some cases it is more like 33% of the staff. It will take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour to get your car. One afternoon around 12:00 pm there were only 2 attendants working the Mandalay Bay valet. It took us 25 minutes to get our car. On the day we checked out we waited an hour for our car. Valet is no longer convenient. Self park is the way to go.    2) Restaurants: Back to my earlier comment - remember 100% capacity/50% staffed. Not all the restaurants are open and the restaurants that are open are not staying open. In the before times we would be gambling into the early hours get hungry at 2 or 3 am and there was always a 24-hour cafe we could go to and have breakfast. Now most restaurants close by 9 or 10 pm. On my way back up to my room between 12:30-1 am I would see a line of people in front of the ""Market"" waiting to spend $15 on a boxed ""gas station"" sandwich. Eat early make reservations and/or bring your own snacks.  3) Free lounge entertainment: Gone.  4) Safety: Because of the 50% staff you will have to step over drunk or homeless people sleeping it off if you decide to walk the strip at anytime of the day. I would reconsider if you are traveling with small children."
30,Refrigerator and coffee are not included as part of your stay. Not able to bring a personal beach umbrella. You are forced to rent an umbrella at inflated prices. You are not allowed to bring your own food or drinks No option to bring personal food or drinks. You are forced to eat fried food and drinks at inflated prices.
10,In this trip alone I experienced a flooded floor dirty bathroom even after I tipped housekeeping and everyone had a bad attitude. Unbelievable! They had the nerve to want to charge $500 for July 4th. Laughable. I checked out and went to a better hotel. Do the same!
40,Very friendly and helpful staff throughout the facility. The room was very good at a reasonable price for Vegas. However the prices for the rental pool services was ridiculously high. $50 - $100/day for an umbrella? $600-$700 for a 6 person cabana? Other costs were also high and this is Vegas but we would not recommend staying here because it felt like your money was being withdrawn from you just breathing the air.
50,We stayed in the One Bedroom Penthouse Suite which was perfect for two. Modern spacious with comfortable seating. Highly recommend. Staff was wonderful very impressed with the size of the property and how clean it was. Great selection on restaurants Border Grill never disappoints. Plenty of gambling options. Mandalay Bay has a tram to Excalibur which by foot can get you to MGM Grand 5-10 minutes. Mandalay Bay is our favorite place to stay on the strip.
20,The main issue is the amount of smoke that comes from the casino floor upon entering or going anywhere in the hotel. Easy check-in with the mobile app. This hotel charged me $65 for simply putting a water bottle into their stocked mini-fridge. I was able to get it straightened out. The bars and restaurants are not very friendly or good. I’d avoid staying at this part of the strip in general since there’s not much to do.
30,Broken AC unit in the room complaint not addressed the 1st time. DIRTY pools not cleaned daily. Finally cleaned after we complained at guest services. Pool bar wait staff doesn't bring your change back had to find a supervisor. $12 for large pop at the pool!!!
50,Had a great time at Mandalay Bay. Most everything was open except the buffet. Room was nice and was a good price. We booked everything on the Mlife website. Place was busy and looked nice. There was some construction going on around the resturants.
50,I loved this location for a trip with kids because it a little distance from the crazy Vegas crowds. It has plenty of amenities and the pool is fantastic. The rooms we very big clean and updated. All the food options were great too. It didn’t even bother us that a few were not open.
30,We chose Mandalay Bay for the Beach area huge number of restaurants and easy access to the rest of the strip. We arrived to find half of the restaurants under construction and closed most of the others either closed or only open two or three days a week and the Tram to the MGM Grand out of service. So not only could we not visit the restaurant in the resort we wanted to but we ended up paying round trip cab fare between $40 and $60 per day to get to restaurants. The pool area is beautiful and has great music but all of the food and drink locations except the beach grill were closed.    We did get to Libertine Social Club for dinner and it was great food and great service. The 1923 bourbon bar was a lot of fun too. The coffee situation in the morning is a different story. Unless you’re at Hazel a few minutes before they open at 7:00 be prepared to wait 20 minutes for your morning cup. Only one of the Starbucks in the resort was open the farthest from guest rooms and had an even longer wait than Hazel. There also a charge to use the make-it-yourself coffee in your room.    I’ve been to Mandalay Bay before and really expected better.
10,See original comment  -lied to  -told that reservation doesn’t lock in what you asked for  -made to feel that room issues were not important  -staff entered room after being asked not to  -no hot water  -no tv first night
40,There are a lot of positives about this hotel- seemed very clean room was very clean lots of restaurants large casino pool nice but very crowded- chairs are so close together difficult to walk between them. I felt it was a bit far from the main strip but there was a tram you could take.
20,Bad experience overall. Bad check in tv not working elevators no good. Trolley was not working too. Did receive food credit but did not have tome to spend it. Room was a bit stuffy as well. Just bad.
40,Most fine dining was closed Monday - Wednesday and many places don’t offer a kids menu but rest of the stay was great. Get to pool first thing if you want a chair and don’t expect any shade. Very friendly staff and room was very clean.
30,Stayed here for 8 days for a business trip off site and nearby. The Elite King room was fantastic but lacked touches that would make this a great room. Poor towels frayed cables on the tv lack of outlets bath products that are not special.    Additionally many restaurants not open each day. Too crowded for the restaurants to handle so lines to get in. Also inundated with convention traffic at certain times.    From a business standpoint the FedEx station that receives all packages sent to the hotel charges $20 per package plus $20 for a bellman to deliver the package. Ridiculous extra charge for a service that every other hotel in America does not charge for.
50,Beautiful pools And beach hotel rooms are a nice size very clean.Beautiful pools And beach hotel rooms are a nice size very clean. sfood court is far from the rooms restaurants choices are great. Buying a tub for the lazy river for $25 is ridiculous. This is to keep what about the people who fly in. RentL should be an option
10,We usually stay at Aria or NYNY but we decided to stay at Mandalay for the pool . Never again !! Bartender rude  I was playing max $1.00 video poker slots at Max $5.00  bartender said that he normally would not comp my play  I don’t get it ? It was a max bet of $5.00!!
40,Cocktail waitress did not exist. Played each day for 5 days and got only two drinks. Slot machines programmed not to win. Many sad faces one after the other not having fun. Restaurants over priced for value received. Owner should immediately program slots to win a little for the common person if you want to stay in business.
10,The room was clean. The bed was comfortable.    I’m giving a 0 because on Tuesday June 29th we were at the pool in the lazy river when a man had a medical emergency. My husband and I are both law enforcement and immediately jumped out of the lazy river to help. My husband began CPR alongside with the family.    We asked an employee for an AED (automated external defibrillator) and they responded with “what is that?” The female life guard was clearly shaken and we overheard her say on the radio “I need people here!” Security responded but no one brought an AED. Maybe had the radio traffic relayed what was needed in the first place a mans life could have been saved.    I burned the bottoms of my feet on the hot stones as I ran off the lazy river island in search of an AED. I went behind the towel/tube rental counter and began searching in the cabinets employees didn’t seem to notice I was even back there. I began flagging employees down asking where an AED was. No one seemed to know. It took more than 5 minutes (from when my husband and I got involved) before an AED was brought to the unresponsive man. The ERT team and security although they were trying they’re best seemed very chaotic and multiple people were giving commands.    My husband and I know from experience that in an immediate medical emergency one person takes control and gives commands to others.    At one point I noticed the AED chest pad was not properly attached to the man’s chest. When I tried telling a member of the ERT team this he replied with “We know what we are doing.”    It seemed to me that those that responded had never been in a medical emergent situation. Training for something and actually going through it are two different things. My husband and an off duty ER nurse were the ones who remained the most calm as they continued compressions and I was timing how many sets were done so this information could be relayed to fire and medics.    My husband informed a family member to be prepared to tell fire and medics any of the mans medications or conditions. We both knew from previous experience these were things that fire and medics were going to need to know.    I held a towel trying to block and give privacy as they worked to save that mans life. I asked an employee if there were sheets or anything nearby to hold up as privacy for the man and his family from the hundreds of people watching and was told no there wasn’t. Members of the family were even yelling for privacy please.    I understand that there is an emergency response team and security for a reason but your off duty first responder guests are going to be first on scene in situations like this if an AED would have been clearly marked and visible for one of us to grab or even more importantly for the many life guards on duty to know where one is it could have made a difference in saving a life.    AED’s should be scattered around the pool area and clearly marked. This simple thing can make a difference and save a life.    It seemed to me that the life guards are there for “show” and to possibly check a box off for the liability insurance the hotel pays for. From what I saw they were laughing and joking around more than paying attention and taking the job seriously.    It was our Anniversary trip and we came back to our hotel room with rose petals chocolate covered strawberries and champagne that was a surprise and paid for but that we didn’t get to enjoy because of that experience.    Because of that experience for my family I would not trust any of those life guards to know what to do in an emergency.    Because of that experience my family will never stay at this hotel again.    Because of that experience I give a zero rating.    Because of that experience I will warn my friends that if their child drowns or their grandpa has a heart attack or they fall and lose consciousness this hotel will not be able to do what is needed to save them.    I thanked the ER nurse although I did not get his name. I know my husband will always put another human life before his own but I thanked him too for always knowing what to do. I know that none of us got involved for the thanks we will or will not get. That’s not why we do what we do.    My condolences to that family and I hope and pray that their loved one is in peace.
10,The room was not made on our second day stay and the calling to guest services took forever  and on the last day came back to our room and surprise there was no water and In COVID times  how is that possible  and the wifi on the floor did not worked  they offered hotel credit for the first inconvenience and a deduct fee for the second one  but this was not at all what I expected of my stay after being over a year and a half without traveling due to Covid.    En el segundo día de nuestra estancia el cuarto no fue hecho se llamo y se pidió que no sé si era en el cuarto no lo pudieron resolver y me mandaron una persona casi a las 10 pm de la noche cuando ya estábamos descansando   El último día de nuestra estancia no tengo agua en nuestro piso cuando regresamos para dormir no había agua para lavarte las manos  la cara  o bañarte en tiempos de COVID.
10,Few things (restaurants/shows/etc.) were open. The tram and moving sidewalks weren't working which means you had to walk nearly a mile just to get to MGM Grand if you wanted to see the rest of the Strip and the same distance back in hot weather.
20,We booked 3 rooms and a suite for a work conference where we would host a small meeting in the conference suite. The actual room was really nice but the suite's fancy shower was broken... and to their credit we got a credit for the broken shower.    I really liked the room though the checkin was a real bummer too. One of our teammates was forced to wait for hours while an authorization that had only 1 of 3 had been told was needed was gathered.
40,Trip to celebrate anniversary. Brought my 19 year old step daughter and came for more of a family trip rather than an adult drinking and gambling experience. Food was good but restaurants were difficult to get. Into and we’re very expensive
40,Overall good service by reservation staff. Vendors way expensive. Water between $5 to $7 dollars. No bottle filling stations do no were to get a drink of water. I stayed for 2 days in 105 weather in the pool area and could.not afford that type of money for water all day.
30,Booked 4 rooms.  Some rooms were clean smelly/musty and faucet problems  Room keys/parking keys would stop working so had to take time to replace only to have replacements not work.  Customer service was okay lots of miscommunication  If you got a daily Food&Bev Credit make sure you triple check locations bc they can get confusing and you will leave with extra charges on ur room.
30,We had no towels in our room and called multiple times to ask for some. Asked 2 people personally and still no towels. 4 hours later and we finally got them . Tried to check out and no internet to do so. Still waiting for refund of money($300)on hold for room it’s been a week. Getting mad.
10,Worst stay in an expensive hotel/resort. We moved rooms 4 times due to smells of dirty socks then sewer smell then no wifi. We stayed in last room but old VOMIT was on the carpet. Staff was so unfriendly and rude even the manager. No compensation no apology. How embarrassing for Mandalay Bay. No one should ever stay here!
30,Check in very difficult. Requested 2 connecting rooms months prior to travel. At 3 pm not ready then at 4 pm still no rooms. Solution was 2 rooms on different floors. Many parts of the hotel qre showing age ie broken or almost broken. Elecator buttons even our room door faceplate fell off!!
20,There were multiple issues with this trip biggest being that the air conditioning was sub par for 4 days. It took me 4 attempts for a tech to come up. The cause for the lackluster AC was a filter that was filthy. If it had been replaced within the 6 months I'd be Shocked.
40,Mandalay Bay is a beautiful resort. There are plenty of restaurants for any budget. The pool area is amazing. Just make sure you go when it first opens at 8:00 am. After a couple of hours it becomes crowded especially in the lazy river with kids. If it’s one or two in your party I would suggest renting a lounge chair and umbrella. That’s two separate costs. The lounge chair was $100 and $75 for the umbrella. Bring your own floatie for the lazy river. They have an air pump you can use for free. Even though I brought a floatie with me I went ahead and purchased one already inflated for $27. I thought I could just let the air out of it and pack it with me but couldn’t get it flat enough to fit in my suitcase so I left it. I ate at Citizens for dinner and breakfast. They were both delicious! In room dining was delicious as well. The only issue I had was the day of my departure. I left my room to go to the lobby to print my boarding pass. Well when I returned to my room it appeared that they deactivated the card. Had to go back downstairs to reactivate to get my belongings. Problem I left everything in the room . The lady asked me for the last 4 digits of the card I had on file. Which I didn’t know. All I could tell her was my address on file and another question she printed a card to access the room. I grabbed my things and decided to head to the airport earlier than planned.
50,All was awesome. Pool parties great. BUT THEY CHARGE TO OPEN THE MINI FRIDGE that is in the room !! & Charge you everytime you open it to take items out and put items in. Had to rent a separate portable mini fridge for an additional $35 a day.
30,Long elevator line every day at all hours of our visit. Key cards to go to floor often malfunctions. Ice machine did not work. 30 minutes on hold to reach front desk. Took two hours for pillows to be delivered. Key card to leave garage also malfunctioned saying my car already parked or already left every day of our stay. Called on room phone to extend stay another day. Went to front desk to confirm extra day and front desk will not honor quoted price. Asked if they will honor the Mandalay Bay website price and they said no. They pretty much decided they didn't want my business.    Wave pool is awesome. Room is very clean. Shower has great pressure. Convenient mobile check-in/checkout
50,The staff at Mandalay Bay should be so proud! We interacted with many and all delivered fantastic service. The facility was clean beautiful spacious relaxing...the food availability and location were outstanding. Casino comfortable. Our favorite of course was the immaculate fun beach and wave pool. So happy with our room and experience that we have no need to look at any other property in the future. Will be back only to Mandalay Bay.
30,Mandalay Bay was overall a great place to stay. The restaurants pool and casino were excellent. I'd also like to make a special note about the stellar safety services at the pool. While at the pool a serious emergency occurred with another guests. The staff were prompt in getting that man care and many staff took turns doing cpr until EMTs arrived. Additionally the number of lifeguards staffed at this facility is admirable. Having said all of the the room was a rough experience primarily due to the temperature in the room. At night it was 78° F even those the thermostat was set to 69°F. Several other reviews complained about this issue so we intentionally only stayed at this hotel on our last night just to be able to enjoy the pool. Glad we did that! Long story short enjoyable but bring a fan if you plan to sleep here.
30,Rooms are ok but dated spa is ok but dated check in is great on the app; valet people are nice but the process sucks. They take forever to get your car (I was late for a business meeting) after a 40 minute wait for valet. Overall is meh for the price. I would stay elsewhere.
50,A must stay when you go to Vegas! We go every year with kids. Pool wave pool lazy river is like no other. Rooms and service are great! We've tried other hotels and they don't compare to Mandalay Bay.
10,MGM has lost my business. The execution all around is just poor. Great idea for digital room keys but force you to use the app and have an internet connection to use it. This wouldn't be a deal breaker if there are practically no signals in the building and there internet cuts out ever other minute. There's the option of printing your own key but know signage or staff to direct you to where you can do that. Then the pipes would were super loud if the room upstairs turned on their faucet (idk why they were up at 3am but that shouldn't be an issue if maintenance was done). Vending machine was always broken or cash only. So I had to go downstairs to the marketplace and pay $5/water instead of $3. Guest services pretty much said well you can sorry but your out of luck. Tried to order breakfast via room service one morning gave up after nearly 10 minutes waiting on the phone. Couldn't even order anything from the 2 Starbucks because they don't take mobile order for some reason?! Lastly the spa. While the massage was great the heat pools were broken and only one had like warm water. It was just a very disappointing visit. Stay away at all costs.
30,This one is a tricky one. I want to love it and I also want to hate it at the same time.    Downsides: First off be careful when booking rooms labeled “strip views” especially if you’re booking one of their 2 bedroom panoramic suites and/or in the lower floors. I got assigned a “strip view” on the 16th floor for a 2 bedroom panoramic suite and its view was so embarrassing -it offered views of rundown Motel 6-Panda Express-Mcdonals-Liquor store-abandon parking lot - I booked another room on the strip for my invited guests who were initially planned to join me in this Mandalay suite. Yes it was THAT unpleasant.    Also this suite was not equipped with a personal refrigerator.    Location is far away from the strip action.    Upside:    1) Staff all over the property were generally pleasant and helpful. Although I did have to wait one hour on two occasions while calling front desk from my room.    2) I’m not a pool person but the pool set up is awesome if you’ve got kids. This is one Vegas pool that doesn’t feel like a resort fee rip off.    3) location is far away from strip action. So it’s great for those who want to stay away from the strip action. Plus the casino floors are well spaced out so you rarely feel like a crammed in sardines in a can.    It’s a love it or hate it situation!
40,The room was beautiful and the view amazing. The wet bar was super expensive so be aware of the cost. Parking a challenge so recommend paying for a valet service. Finally watch your bill and make sure charges line up. Don’t be dumb like me and just accept it.
40,Was visiting for a week on business. Everything was pleasant but would recommend bringing your own coffee cup for the room until the hotel can get a new coffee kit vendor as the coffee takes on the awful taste of the cup and Starbucks gets back to an every day schedule.
50,My account was billed for 8 times more than what I was quoted and my account got frozen and I was without money for for the whole rest of my stay in vegas. I could not buy food or go anywhere to enjoy my time from out of state and the night my account was frozen was my only free night from work meetings. Not pleased at all and will never book with the app or the hotel again
20,Check in process.. ridiculous. Enough said.  Where can a girl get a cup of coffee that doesn't cost $12?? Nothing open at 7 am. Had to go into casino to the betting lounge for $10 cup of black coffee. Minimal restaurants open at any time. Finally found the food court and it was all the way by the convention center. People were rushing to the little mini mart for snacks since everything closed at 8:00 during the weekdays. I get it we're still opening up due to covid. If there is minimal stores open bring the prices down a little bit. Had to run to the liquor Depot across the street for beer since it was $9.00 anywhere you went in the hotel. They say you gamble and they bring you free drinks that never happened. Pool closed at 7pm avoid the elevators at time.
30,This was our First Ladies Trip to Vegas. The rooms were clean and there was plenty to do at Mandalay Bay. However the rooms need to be updated and there weren’t many restaurants to choose from as stated/lots of renovation going on too.
50,This was our first time staying at Mandalay Bay Hotel and it was nothing short of great! We needed assistance from security and they arrived almost immediately. They were all so professional and friendly and ensured we had everything we needed before departing. Our last encounter was with Chief of Security Sandy - wow we already had a great experience with his team prior and after meeting Sandy we see why his team was so wonderful. Sandy’s leadership and professionalism definitely reflected on his team.    We applaud you for providing a safe environment for everyone as we understand the resorts are extremely busy this summer.    Thank you Sandy and the Security Team for your professionalism and hospitality. Our family appreciates you!    The Manuel Family
20,Didn’t get housekeeping after asking for it and extending my stay for an additional day i ran out of towels and had to sleep in the same sheets for 3 day they said they would make a note of it and they never show up
10,No fridge or microwave! (You can pay extra to use the fridge)  My air didn’t work and they didn’t fix it!  Customer service is awful here!!  Also as adults … you can’t relax here with the amount of kids kicking you in the pools.
40,I enjoyed myself at this hotel. Room was super nice the view I happened to get wasnt the best but the room was still enjoyable. clean comfrtable. The wave pool and Mandalay beach was pretty cool too! All in all a nice stay.
50,Vegas may not be the first place you consider for a family vacation but Mandalay Bay can definitely change that. The lazy river and wave pool will keep the kids entertained all day. And the amazing restaurants offer a variety of eating options to satisfy everyone.
10,Bell hop lost my valet ticket which cost my daughter to be VERY late for her National Dance Competition. The rooms were filthy. The beds extremely uncomfortable. Terrible linens. And housekeeping threw out $800 in food my husband had bought to feed the family after competition yet left trash not dumbed. The floor manager was suppose to call me yet never did. Definitely not an upscale experience.
40,Nicely appointed rooms with efficient housekeeping services and friendly housekeeping staff. There are several pools and water features including a lazy river and wave pool. Access is free if you are a hotel guest. Towels are provided but you must buy (expensive) or bring your own tube. There are restrictions on type and size so check before you arrive. The pool is not open at night. You should go early to reserve chairs or you may be out of luck. Still the water features are a real bonus if you will be in Vegas in the hottest months.  Mandalay Bay is at the southern end of the strip and is relatively quiet It is rather hard to find open restaurants at reasonable prices on the resort property. All but one of the restaurants in the food court closes early. This is not the case at other hotels.  Because of Mandalay Bay's location you should be prepared to by a bus ticket (3 day pass for 20 bucks) or hire an Uber to get anywhere beyond Excalibur or New York New York depending on how much you feel like walking. They advertise a tram from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur with a stop at the Luxor but unfortunately it only runs on the weekends and the hours are limited.  There are long waits at the hotel lobby desks. There appears to be a shortage of help. Some are clearly better trained than others.  One word of warning: don't move or touch anything in the room refrigerator unless you wish to purchase it. If you do or if you try to store anything of your own in it you will be charged $50. Check your itemized bill.
30,"Mandalay bay has great pools the ""Noodle Shop"" has wonderful won ton noodle soup the waitress at ""Sea Breeze Cafe"" was very pleasant. On hold to long with ""guest service"" and when i got through i faced attitude room didnt get serviced for 2 days ugh!"
50,Mandalay Bay did not disappoint. The pool was great the rooms were nice and the beds were very comfortable. Getting in and out of the resort was easy and convenient. Went to an Aces game and walking from our room to the arena was nice.
50,It was a pleasant stay. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Service was good and food was also very good. Rooms had air conditioner which was a must. Not as hot as we were expecting but that was ok. We will probably return in the future.
10,The Mandalay Bay property is filthyevery place you sit or touch is sticky pool is disgusting wave pool has so much trash around it. Can’t get food service unless you chase down a server. People that work at hotel need training tried to get coffee by pool was told all out and she said that means we’ll be out for days.
50,I love staying at Mandalay Bay - I have been here many times. It smells so good on this property. Many restaurants and shops a variety of pools health club spa awesome casino - everything you could want is on the property. Wear comfy shoes though because it's BIG!!!
10,Rooms were dirty staff was extremely rude. Things constantly stopped working ; water doors tvs. Extremely hard to get in contact w/front desk. Nobody would help unless we spoke to a manager. Very unpleasant stay.
10,Front desk supervisor was rude and argumentative room was not clean properly casino was dirty and not maintained. Casino floor waitresses was bitchy room cleaning staff was friendly. Would not stay here again
50,My initial reason for coming here was the pool party but the other bars and clubs located inside the casino were just as fun and amazing. Rooms were beautiful and clean and casino was very clean as well.
50,First vacation back post pandemic! My family and I had a wonderful time!  The staff was kind and professional and the amenities were great!  The MLife benefits are second to none.  We will be coming back!
20,Stay in Premium Suite Room was dated need fixes & bad sewer smell from bathroom toilet bathroom fixtures need broken light bulbs burned out. Back Cabanas were run down rust on structures furniture was well used & stained.
40,I enjoyed the hotel overall. My room was comfortable and clean. I loved the bathroom. The pools were great and it was nice to have an option for only adults. I'll definitely be returning and highly recommend.
50,Very nice place to stay! The pool is spectacular really cool. The room really spacious and clean. It was a very nice experience with my family. A beautiful view as well from our room!!!! I really recommend Mandalay Bay resort & casino
10,I have been to Mandaly Bay twice in the last few months. The first visit in March was for a friend's wedding. The bellhop lost the grooms parent luggage and wedding attire. I contacted them and seperatley filled out a post visit survey listing the issue. No one ever tried to contact me or remedy the issue.    I just returned from our last trip (probobly my last). I went there to celebrate my anniversary. When we got into our room we noticed the air conditioning was not working. The room was 80 to 85 degrees. We contacted the front desk twice over 2 days and were told someone would be coming to look at the ac. No one ever showed up. Spent 2 nights barely sleeping waking up all night because of the heat. Also no contact from anyone to check that the issue was resolved.    I cannot believe that they have fallen so far from the amazing resort they used to be. If you are headed to Las Vegas grab a room at the motel 6 you could save $200 a night and receive similar customer service.
50,We had the two bedroom panoramic view suite awesome room with great views of all the massive pool areas. We had a VIP treatment from checking in to check out. Very friendly staff clean spacious rooms and an awesome time at the adult pool.
50,I recommend this hotel I love it in all the aspects. Cleaness attractions family friendly the view the modern design rooms. I would recommend them the only thing I would say is if you are parking in the mandalay garage let them know so they can add parking access if not the card won't work to go in and out of the parking and will have to pay extra money for parking there.
40,The beds slept good. Don’t stay on 7th floor unless you know the ice maker has been fixed. It’s a pain to go to another floor especially since your key card is programmed for your floor. We stayed in a suite and the living room furniture needs to be updated. The pool area is very big with a wave pool and lazy river along with the pool
20,The title says it all everything is super expensive! 20 dollar bottles of water in your room. Resort fees are outrageous and the service is ok but I feel you could get as good or better service at a hotel that cost less. Without all the hidden cost!
40,Restaurants are overpriced and restaurant staff unenergetic apathetic ungrateful snobs. Casino and hotel staff were impeccable on the other hand. The 2 services are mismatched for a resort of high esteem. I was here on business end enjoyed the vast openness of the conference venue the high ceilings and professional staff. The restaurant services and prices really upset me though. At least I get ‘….my pleasure….’ from Chik-fil-A but the hostesses and waiters at these ‘fine’ restaurants were ungrateful and entitled.
30,Very disappointed with the quality of the room. One sink did not drain. We had to constantly reset the bathroom lights because the circuits would trip. A light fixture over the wet bar was hanging out of the ceiling. The AC in the bedrooms were warm. When we first arrived at the room there was an empty water bottle in the corner and a random pill on the bathroom counter. An upscale room which was less than average. With respect to the resort amenities the restaurants were top notch. I was disappointed with the congestion at the bank of elevators in the lobby. Often the keys would not work for the elevator and room. We were not the only people with this issue. Had to constantly wait at the front desk to receive replacement keys. There is an app for the room key which never worked in the elevator. And why is the food court miles away? Made no sense logistically.
30,Normally Mandalay Bay is excellent. The trip everything seemed far from normal still with staff stressed venues closed or under construction prices hiked above normal and little information available about when that would change.
50,I have stayed at Mandalay Bay a few times now and have always had a positive experience. This time was no different. I love this property. It has a great layout. The rooms are very comfortable and their pool area is second to none in Las Vegas. I came with my family which included my 2 nephews and my niece. They absolutely love the wave pool and the lazy river. The staff both at the front desk and the casino are very friendly and helpful. I have stayed at most of the properties on the Strip and I would recommend this one above any other in Vegas.
10,I recently stayed at the Mandalay Bay property last week. Their new check-in process is to authorize a credit card $100 per day for each day of your stay to cover incidentals except they don't just authorize your card they charge your card the full amount of the authorization. I had changed my credit card authorization at check-in but the agent apparently didn't put it on the reservation record so when I checked out the hotel credit the card I held my room on and not the card that I actually authorized charges to go on. The hotel said they could fix the issue but they have to charge my other card the $400 that they accidentally refunded and then refund my card that they accidentally charged so now I'm paying credit card interest on $800 worth of faulty charges that it should have never been charged in the first place while I wait for both cards to get the refund processed. Save your time save your money go somewhere else.
20,Fairly nice room but no WiFi no resolution. noisy neighbors (not hotels fault) Almost everything was way over priced (even for Vegas) Don't touch the coffee cups water or anything in the fridge. They will charge you instantly.
30,Cost an extra $50 just to put your own stuff in the mini fridge in the room the fridge is full of canned sodas for $10.00 per can… everything has a sensor on it so if you touch anything even my accident you have to Goto front desk to get the charges removed.
30,Internet is slow and intermittent plumbing shut down twice for an hour or more.  Lazy river and wave pool are just right for super hot days.  No microwave charge for fridge.  Food court is really far from elevators.
20,My wife and I were staying here prior to my dropping her off at the airport the next day. We were hoping to take advantage of the pool and as she has very fair skin we wanted to rent an umbrella or find shade. Let;s just say we never got to use the pool. But what really affected my review is that we were kept up all night by a loud roudy family in the room we were connected to by a door.  we contacted security no less than 3 time...and when they did finally show up they did absolutely nothing to quiet the family down.
50,Mandalay Bay is by far my favorite resort on the strip. The staff are friendly and the slots are friendly too. It is a clean wonderful atmosphere. I have not been disappointed with the restaurants or experiences at Mandalay Bay. Make sure you bring your mlife players card. The loyalty program is generous and they have many super fun events. I make it a point to see the Michael Jackson show ONE and walk down the Michael Jackson hallway at least once every single trip.
40,Housekeeping staff accidentally wrapped up our granddaughters toy in bedding that was sent offsite. There was no answer to our call to L&F. No one has yet to contact us with status of the lost toy. Sad
50,My husband and I came out for our 15th anniversary. We stayed in a beach level king room. The room was nice. My only complaint was more vents needed for the ac. It was a scorching weekend in las vegas. The staff was great loved the hotel and all it's amenities restaurants pools etc.
10,The parking is horrible the check in was horrible the rooms have a fridge but it’s not for you unless you want to pay for they’re overpriced goodies. We didn’t even get a complimentary water after our one mile journey in 114 degree heat. The elevators are garbage…you have to wait forever like an idiot. They don’t have a microwave horrible for families. They charge for parking even if you have a room paid already. It’s just sad…ruined everything.
50,The mandalay is the best hotel on the strip.  The staff are courteous and professional.  The swimming pools are the best in the area. The restaurants are great and have on of the best Irish pubs in the area. I won’t stay at any other hotel.
50,I stayed in Reef Suite room for my birthday and have small party in there with my friends. The room was so nice clean and comfy. A bellboy was so nice and helpful. Also house keeper was so nice too. I love it.
10,We stayed there for Thursday and Friday June24-25 2021 and there was an extremely loud concert in their pool area that played Friday until 2:30am. We had to get up at 3:30am due to 5:45 flight out. Needless to say nobody in our family got any sleep. Also they push a wonderful water park however charge you $27 to buy a tube for their lazy river- that’s over $100 for a family of 4. We have stayed at many other places in Vegas much better than this and will never return to Mandalay Bay.
10,Pools not Kid friendly. To many intoxicated adults. Pool Chairs had towels all over the them that guests were not using so nobody could use them. Didn't have anybody to regulate it. Also not enough umbrellas for sun shade so you were forced to purchase a cabana also beer cans and cups floating in the pool and all over common areas.  Was not able to check into our room until almost 1600.  Ice machines on the 12 floor were not working well. Had to keep my sons medicine cold. They were able to get our room a medical fridge to accommodate us which I appreciated
10,Family vacation and booked 8 rooms. My work back pack containing my Dell computer was stole from my room. I filed a Secuity Report and was told there were no security cameras in the halls. Expensive stay!
50,I was a good experience we came for us first time I was so happy we are thinking of caming back at the same place this year I recommend this place it’s clean nice I bring all my kids with my it was fun
30,This was our first trip to Las Vegas and overall it was good. The check in was insane. I checked in using the mobile app around 9am and the room wasn't ready until after 4pm. The lobby was full of people waiting on their rooms. We had no water in our room on Wednesday when we woke up and when I called the desk they said it would still be a couple hours so no showers that morning. The valet was amazing and very helpful! the room itself was nice and we slept like a dream!
40,The hotel and room was very nice overall. I had a few problems.    My biggest concern was thelack of water fountains (I counted 0 !!). It was 114 degrees during my visit. A water fountain with a bottle refill station was desperately needed as I returned to the hotel. Water fountains in the pool area are also desperately needed. It was a health concern as Las Vegas gets to 100+ temperatures regularly in the summer.    I was disappointed with the signage in thehotel. I was dropped off on the lower (beach) level by my Uber driver. I walked in. It was not obvious where to go. There was not an employee anywhere on the lower level to ask. Not a great first impression. Shortly after checking in we left to go to a restaurant via Lyft/Uber. We went to where we were dropped off and that was wrong. Finally found a sign that said Uber Pick-Up Area and I thought I found it only to get close and read the small print that said past parking area. At that point the only parking area was 3 spaces. There was no pick-up area. Finally figured out that it was up the ramp. Should be BIG signs in the Lobby to point you to the Uber pick-up area. Should also include Lyft on the sign.    The no outside beverages in the pool policy is just plain greedy. I can agree with a no glass policy and possibly a no-alcohol policy but not allowing canned or plastic bottle soft drinks and water is just greedy. And then charging $5 for a Pepsi is gouging. They make it a captive audience by not allowing outside beverages. Two words gouging and greedy.    You could use a direct sidewalk from the hotel to the strip. Besides Uber/Lyft we used the Deuce (bus) on occasions. We found ourselves walking in the driveway dodging cars.    Finally it pissed me off that the ticket redemption machines did not dispense change. The pennies nickels dimes and quarters add up. On my last day I waited in line at the cashier for my 97¢ out of principle.    Seems like you try to nickel and dime all the guests.
10,The stay was awful. Towels smelled burnt sink made awful noises our view was a dead bird safe stopped working with our stuff locked inside ac didn’t work. It was awful. I would never plan a trip there again.
10,Their staff and service was the worst we’ve experienced in 30 years that we’ve been coming to Vegas. Unfriendly staff and they were very short staffed. The cabana rental at the pool was a disaster that cost us $575.00!
40,Booked a king size room which was quite large with his and her closets a nice seating area and a very large bathroom. Very clean. It was 117° when we visited so we were unable to enjoy the pool but it looked very nice. Breakfast in the restaurant was good. One of the bars served very fresh drinks. Not artificial mixers. Very good. Room was quiet too. And good AC in that heat!
20,Service and amenities are lackluster as they open the property back up after Covid (which is understandable) but they try to make everything right but don’t follow through. Room changes were presented at check-in with a promise to contact with a correct room but that never materialized. Hotel room was in poor working order (multiple issues with bathroom) and smelled of cannabis on the weekend (hotel rooms do not have door jams so the smell seeps in). Will not be visiting again.
40,The staff was very helpful. The room had a pretty good view. I wish there was a refrigerator in the room though. Besides that it was a very positive experience overall. The food was amazing especially strip steak
20,"We had a few issues with the room with little help. The second night we could not get our bathroom lights to turn on. Finally we found the breaker needed to be reset. This did not even occur to us because we had not plugged anything in. It happened again the second night so we called the front desk and after a 20 min wait they said they would have maintenance come and check on it. They NEVER came.    Then our TV would freeze for 10 to 15 mins at a time. Not a big deal but the next day we then received a notice on our TV ONLY (thank goodness we turned it on after it not working) that we would not have water the ENTIRE day. We had pool day (stuff all ready reserved and paid for) then reservations for dinner with no water. If we had not turned on the TV I would have ben even more upset with no notice. There should be many ways you notify guests of this. I mean you could no flush the toilet for the entire day!!!    After we took a shower in our friends room in another tower we came back to find our ceiling was pouring out water. Not just a small drip but a stream of water. No only was it loud but I worried about the lights. I called the main desk and after 30 mins of waiting to get someone they said the room above us had flooded their room and it was dripping to our room. They said we were priory 1 and someone would be down to look at it. No time frame. This was at 8:30pm- we waited until 11:00 pm and NO ONE CAME. No one EVER came. We needed to shower and get to bed for our flight in the morning and we waited for nothing. We were told we would have the $39 resort fee waived for one night. Are you kidding me? All this trouble and that it- no ""sorry"" - nothing. There are so many places to choose from on the strip you would think a bit more effort would be put in to make our experience at the least comfortable. Needless to say we will not be recommending nor staying at this resort again. The pool and spa services were amazing but not enough to put up with all of this."
30,I give this resort and Casino three stars because they charge a resort fee and charge for parking also sorry I believe they should be up front with all fees associated with the room costs at booking.  We chose Mandalay Bay because of the pools for our 10 year old granddaughters first trip to Las Vegas. The wave pool and lazy River are great she had so much fun.  Pros  1. Upon Monday afternoon arrival valet had a back up and we waited for 10 minutes to be let in but the valet staff was so friendly. Don't forget to tip them.  2. Check in was very quick with mobile check in and assistance from the staff but I miss the interaction with the front desk. We had our keys in about 10 minutes from when we got to the lobby  3. Room was clean and well equipped but was on the 4th floor so the view was the valet which was disappointing.  4. Casino is large and clean and not very crowded.  Cons  1. Of course resort fees and parking fees  2. Mobile check in is quick but miss talking to the front desk and getting room options. Also you can't tip or sweet talk your phone to get a better room.  3. Tram was not working which makes it hard to get to other casinos.  4. Spotty WiFi in room.  Food  We did eat breakfast at the Beach Bar and Grill it's a bit expensive breakfast sandwich was $16.00 and coffee was $6. Fruit bowl was $9 and the Summer Salad was $13 all were very tasty and the service was great and super friendly which made the price acceptable.  We did not eat at the other restaurants mostly do to the poor online reviews and we left early do to our granddaughter got sick.
40,Beautiful resort. Many things were not open on the Tuesday and Wednesday we were there and it seemed the resort was short staffed when it came to morning help. We were very pleased with the pool area and the Shark Reef Aquarium was a lot of fun to explore!
10,Rooms were dirty towels had hairs room had no toilet paper. Racist waitress toward Latinos at casino called security on my father for no reason. Waitress ignored father while playing at casino. Bad experience :(
10,Arrived to a shut down building and had to walk to MGM Grand to eat anything whereas things were advertised as open and 24 food court. Pool was overcrowded because it was the only thing else open besides the casino. Very inconsistent information from staff in you can find one .. we had to call the hotel from the lobby twice. There was no bedding or towels for 36 hours as the staff did not wash Monday according to the staff. That second sweaty hot fun day in the sun with friends was gross. The place is absent of any true amenities and has the run down clinically depressing atmosphere of a 1990s Gold Nugget Casino.
30,You have many options for your Las Vegas trip and Mandalay is a decent one for the money. Don’t expect any amenities for free and pay attention to your location on the strip. Rooms are adequate but you can find better for most other things elsewhere.
40,My only complaint about this establishment ( and frankly about similar places) is the lack of refrigerators for personal use and the lack of complimentary coffee for paying guests. Everything else was splendid
50,Had a great time and would definitely visit again. Hotel was better than expected. Also way more affordable than expected. Casino was nice too. For a first time visit i was great. Did not use pool but looked beautiful so much to do.
50,I adore staying at this hotel. It always smells so great and that’s always a plus for me. The staff is amazing too. I’ve never had a problem while staying at the mandalay. I always recommend my friends to stay there.
10,I checked in I got to room it wasn’t clean I got charged for the previous person the tv did not work my advice take pictures when entering yes even the mini bar I got charged 20 for a water seriously it was redic I was told the pool chairs came with umbrellas nope extra 75 do your home work here not fun I’m going back to ceasers
50,We loved just about everything about Mandalay Bay. The room was wonderful housekeeping is excellent all staff we friendly and helpful and we had fun at the casino.  TV reception comes and goes and internet is okay.  The thumping bass booming from another pool is very annoying and can be heard in the rooms. Pool music is good except for that annoying unmusical thump.  The casino was really fun. There should be drinking water made available at all times.  The entrances elevators and shops on the property are convenient and pedestrian friendly for coming and going. Mandalay Bay is very nicely located by some of our other favorite hotel casinos.
10,Would not recommend this place this place was so durty they said they had short staff there was empty bottles on my shower blankets was dirty we had 6 rooms on of the rooms the bathroom door was broken they didn’t come till next day to fix it it was falling down and there was kids in the room really Dangerous also we took my dad for Father’s Day and one of the casino Waitress made him cry because he was ignored scream and she was so recital Against him she did so many bad thing Against my family never did I seen my dad cry only when my brother pass and seeing him like this broke my heart it’s not fair that she mess all my family’s trip this was our first time going out for a family vacation after this pandemic and wish this never happen would of expected better from this hotel
20,"Mandalay Bay is an affordable and fun hotel to stay in when visiting Las Vegas. Nothing compares to the lazy river and wave pool access included in your stay. However we encountered a frustrating issue when trying to check in for this most recent trip.    When we arrived we found that our first room was not clean. Specifically there was ""something"" remaining in the toilet from the previous guest. We were assigned a new room and given a $50 food credit as an apology. When we went to the second room we found that it was OCCUPIED by someone else. Aside from being completely surprised when walking into the room we realized what a serious security risk this could be. What if they issued keys to our room to someone else?? Anyway we then returned to the lobby again and were issued a 3rd room. This room was fine but the entire check-in process took over an hour by the time we waited in line each time to be helped.    Additionally the $50 credit we were issued was never applied to our bill and I had to work it out with accounting after we returned home.    All-in-all it was a frustrating check-in experience. I like Mandalay Bay but because of the inconvenience we will probably use a different hotel next time."
40,I did enjoy the resort and hotel there were some issues with room a/c and people smoking in the toilet prior to my stay but the staff were amazingly polite and helpful. The front desk staff was great at check in and all of the servers and resort employees were very friendly
10,Mandalay Bay 06/16-20/21  1) Teenagers would sit in the Floor and block the passageway while the Uniformed Security Guard was standing 10 feet away doing nothing.  2) Room carpet and furnishings were stained and dirty.  3) Previous Room Guest left there Shopping bags Phone Chargers and other items in the room.  4) We were told are rooms were not cleaned yet (@12 Noon) and we could ‘Check-In’ for our rooms but not get into our Rooms. We requested Rooms together Strip View with a refrigerator and on a high Floor (same request I made with the Concierge the week before we arrived. The Desk Clerk told us that would not be a problem so I gave her $100 tip and thanked her. Our Rooms were on the 19th Floor our ‘Strip View’ was from a 24” wide window behind a 36” wide column and the Rooms were three Rooms apart. One person at a time could squeeze themselves between the window and the column and ooh & aah over the beautiful Las Vegas ‘Strip’ view.  3) Our Two Bedroom Suite had four Air Conditioning Units. The only problem was our Suite NEVER was cooler than 78 Degrees even at 2 AM! The excuse was we should have called their Maintenance Team. NO we shouldn’t have to call anyone. Their Rooms are monitored by the building’s Energy Monitoring Conservation System (Central Computer).  4) Hotel and Casino Staff acted as if we were inconveniencing them. Smiling to our faces then sighing and/or making a face as we turned to leave.  5) When asking the Front Desk or the MLife Desk a question they would simply say “please come back later our system is down”.  6) When returning our vehicle at the Hotel Valet our wait would sometimes take 30 minutes and a ¼ Tank of Gas.  7) NONE of the Hotel Room Maids ever had Washcloths. Of the four nights there our room was only Serviced ONE Time by the Maids. The excuse we received was that Hotel Guest were taking them.  8) When asked for information the MB Staff answers were almost always WRONG! Worst part was their smirking when they didn’t think we were watching. No one was ever at the Information or Concierge Desk. The ONLY correct/helpful answers I received was from the Bellman Desk.  9) Drink Waitstaff at the Slots were hard to find on the Casino Floor.  10) Totals on my Win/Loss Sheet are wrong. None of the loss column total are correct. I played Craps three different times starting with $1K each time. And I was not winning on any of their Crap Tables.  11) Even-though I showed my Player’s Gold Card and Reservation my Room was still charged for Valet Parking my vehicle.  12) At least 30% of the time the Escalators did not work.  13) A couple of times we had to get a new Room Key Cards. Normally this would not be a big deal but we would never know when are RKCs would work until we got in the elevator and tried to get to our Rooms. By then we would have to ride all the way up till the last Guest exited and then all the way back down where we would wait in line again.  14) NO big Show Entertainers at the MBay. Had to go to MGM Grand to see Brad Garrett. Who was NOT worth the money we paid! Notices for Carrot Top did not come out until after we bought tickets for Brad Garrett. I would have been much happier with Carrot Top. Why couldn’t MBay have secured some Entertainment like Weird Al Yankovic? Frankie Vallie?  15) NO Buffets. Ate breakfast at House of Blues and had the Steak & Eggs. Instead of Steak & Eggs this should be renamed as O’ Sole O’Meo Plate because I probably could have used that steak to resole my shoes.  16) We were celebrating my Sister’s Birthday and she did not receive any recognition.  17) I was there for the Barrett-Jackson Auction which was moved from MB in October to June at the Convention Center. The ONLY reason we were at the Mandalay Bay was for the Auction. We had to travel the entire Strip to get there and back EACH day! In JUNE at 116 Degree heat!  After being shut down and/or at a reduced occupancy status for almost a year one would think that a Tourist Industry business would be utilizing that time to retraining their staff in better communication with the Guest/Patrons/Co-Workers cleaning their rooms and furnishings completing their preventive maintenance and/or upgrading their facilities and utilities to give their Guest/Patrons a more enjoyable experience.
10,Many restaurants/bars are not open so if you're hungry or want a coffee in the morning you'll need to go somewhere else (probably using your car) which pretty much defeats the entire point on being in an all inclusive resort. It'll cost you extra to leave the casino (either in parking or an Uber) though. I finally had enough and left a day early just to find somewhere to actually relax.
20,I stayed at this property for one night. The reason I booked the hotel was because my son wanted to use the wave pool and the rooms looked like they were well kept.    I checked in and immediately realized everything was an additional fee parking (valet $30 self parking $15) a huge resort fee late checkout $30 for an extra hour) storing a personal drink in the mini bar ($50).    What really bothered me was that we had a reservation for 4 and they had 2 small towels in the bathroom. Seriously there is no excuse for not adequately stocking the bathroom with towels. Also the shower drain was so clogged that water was retained in the shower even after 1 minute.    The extra fees while annoying was nothing compared to the lack of even trying to maintain the room or stock it adequately for your customers. Perhaps if I had asked for enough towels for 4 people there would have been a surcharge on that as well.
10,Dirty rooms with dirty towels and pillow cases. Really unhappy that all 6 rooms had an issue. Rude and racist casino waitress screamed at my father and threatened to call security as she stormed off because i asked why had she been continuosly ignoring my father.
50,Best time ever. Excellent service from front desk casino service waiters and housekeepers. I enjoy staying at Mandalay Bay because of the service and wouldn't stay anywhere else. Even the guests are awesome.
30,My room was given to another guest while I had it and opened the door and they refuse to leave. Got locked up due to the incident and was not I formed that I need a new key..Called the front desk from the 28th floor and was on hold for 10mins finally ended up going down…unbelievable..
40,Great place to stay staff was friendly has everything you need all in one place pool is too notch shark reef is a must see the gambling had more then enough seats for everyone that wanted to play night clubs are awesome!!
20,Make sure you verify all charges on your folio. I was supposed to be comp four nights however they charge me for the fourth night after I spent so much money all across all the MGM resort hotels and there was nothing that they can do and I was so frustrated that I will not go back.
40,Great property overall but it is obvious that the place is short staffed. Spent 30 minutes waiting to drop off our car at valet parking in the middle of the afternoon. Waited another ten minutes to get keys printed after mobile check in cause no internet in the elevators. Sea Breeze Cafe was just plain terrible in terms of service…and food was cold when it finally arrived but servers never even bothered to check in with us till the meal was over…gotta be better options for breakfast. On the positive side the rooms are very nice…the pool area looks amazing though we never went there. Tram to other properties not running. My advice is wait awhile till they get some of these issues resolved before visiting.
50,I was impressed with the room size and that it had both a shower and a tub. Pools were very family friendly. Check in and check out was super easy. This hotel is on one end of the strip but they always have taxis ready to go so we didn’t mind.  I do have 1 complaint. I got charged like $17 for a tiny cup of piña colada with liquor (supposedly). It seemed like it had absolutely no liquor in it.
10,From the moment we attempted to check in it was a terrible experience. We reserved a room with a large party months ago. I payed extra for a Staywell room at the time of my reservation. After waiting 3 hours for a room I was given a room on a different floor. I asked for a portion of the resort fee to be waived for my trouble and the front desk attendant literally laughed at me. After speaking to another attendant I was finally given a room on the correct floor but it was not the type of room I initially reserved. I was told I would have a $150 food and beverage credit but I didn’t see a credit on my folio.  Once in our room my daughter picked up a bottled water and sat it down. I was charged $20 even though no one used the water. When I called to ask for the fee to be removed the desk attendant told me my daughter was old enough to know not to touch things.  In addition to the extremely unacceptable customer service another member in our group had dirty stained sheets on their bed.  Every individual in our group had issues checking in getting the correct room or issues with their room.  I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy and I will never stay here again.
10,I paid almost 350 $s for the room including resort fees and EVERYTHING is extra. Bottles of water and coffee have charges which are hidden.  The room itself was very dated and the carpets look not very clean.  The towels are probably a few years old.  If you open the minibar even without consuming anything there is a charge.  If you call guest services or concierge there is a wait time for around 20 minutes.  I will never stay in this hotel again.  The toilet seat wouldnt stay open.  Overall a very negative experience.
20,We arrived for our check in very late at around midnight and used the mobile app to get checked-in which was very convenient and allowed us to generate digital keys on our phone which was great so I’ll give them that. We immediately went to sleep and upon waking up found blood on one of the pillow cases. I immediately went to the front desk and let someone know that not only did this happen but I had found other reviews with similar issues and that was VERY concerning. He apologized said he could only move our room if we downgraded and instead offered us either a $50 food and beverage credit or a refund of one nights resort fees. We took the credit and went about our day. When we returned that night we did have new bed linens and those too were dirty with what looked to be blood. This time I went and spoke with a hotel manager because clearly this is a recurring thing. I’ve seen multiple other reviews since September 2020 stating similar experiences. They obviously don’t and haven’t been taking cleaning protocols seriously. Aside from the bloody linens the rest of the room and hotel were also not that clean and pretty outdated. The manager apologized and refunded all of our resort fees but aside from the pool it just isn’t worth it. The location is good if you don’t want to be dead center on the strip and their beach/pool area is one of the better ones for sure but taking everything else into consideration I would never stay here again. Even when I went to check out I was still being charged the resort fees and when I asked to speak to someone about it the guy who spoke to me was extremely rude and nasty. I come to Vegas quite frequently as I live in SoCal but I will never stay at this hotel and have encouraged the travel agency I use to discourage others from staying here.
50,I just want to give high praise to Lizzy at the check-in desk and her manager Yxcel. My wife and I ran into a complications with our flight and these two jumped right into action. We will definitely be back! These two are prime examples of above and beyond customer service. The amenities are just a plus but the customer service makes you feel like you have family is working in the hotel. Thank you again Lizzy and Yxcel!
30,This hotel is nice except the temperature in the room was way too hot. I’m disabled and I swell up when it’s too hot especially at night. I spent most of my time in the room because I have many physical disabilities so I need my rest. Unfortunately my body couldn’t handle the hot temperature in our room. We called maintenance who came up and changed the filter in the air conditioner but it didn’t do anything to rectify the situation. Even my 21 year old daughter who is in great health had trouble getting comfortable each night. We had to sleep on top of the covers each night. It made us all very uncomfortable for our stay. It was too bad because the beds were super comfortable and the staff was amazing even though they couldn’t help us in the end. If they could change that one thing we could accept all the extra fees they charge you. You can’t use the tiny fridge in your room unless you pay an extra $50 per day. We brought our own cooler so it was okay. Also the yucky coffee in the room with the powdered creamer was $10 per cup. I’ve never had to pay for hotel room coffee before. So we went and bought a coffee maker so we could make our own good coffee in the room. My mom and my daughter just LOVED the pools so that was good. They got the big pool drinks and they were $30 each. My daughter almost fainted when she heard the total. Haha!
30,Parking is not included no one offered me a drink while I was gambling drinks are weak for the price…. Weak weak like where is the booze? . The room is ok but it’s Not one of the nicer places.    In addition to the added cost of parking per night pricy drinks and a ok room water cost $20. I’m surprised ice is free.    I wouldn’t recommend staying here vs. the other hotels.    I did the price line gamble and got stuck in a pretty average place…at least it’s not Trump tower.
40,Spend one night here recently on our way from Zion National Park to the Hoover Dam. Beautiful rooms very polite and helpful staff. Restaurants close early so plan ahead for dinner. Great water park/pool area but it is extremely crowded. This hotel is at the end of the Las Vegas Strip so it’s a bit quieter which I liked. It is however a long way from the main area where all the action is at night. We bought a city bus pass and rode all the way down to Fremont Street…took a while since the traffic is so heavy but a good way to get around if you don’t want to hassle with parking. I liked the location but if you prefer to be in the center of the action you may want to stay at a hotel closed to the center of the strip. Be prepared to walk a lot!
50,After a long year of not being able to travel because of the Pandemic I decided to visit Vegas. Took my mom and a friend and we stood at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. I can say it was the best choice I could have made. Service was great but the Security was outstanding. The lobby and all aéreas were always supervised by security. I was not afraid to leave my mom on her own at the Casino because I knew she was safe there. I will definitely visit Mandalay again thanks to the great Security system they have.
20,Over priced smoke filled and over crowded. An astonishing amount of kids/families. Pool is so full you can’t find a seat. Prices for seats/cabanas are very expensive. The rooms don’t allow you to use the fridge without paying. I expected prices to be high for food/drink but it really blew me away. Not a good value and wouldn’t recommend unless you love gambling. Service was poor and not friendly. Save the money.
20,The buffet is closed. Closed. There are 3 options waiting time was 1-15 hours. Nothing at Delano.  If you are traveling with family - avoid it. It is a joke.  Understaffed and building sites everywhere.
30,Lovely property and pools were amazing. Hotel is at the end of the strip so it's very quiet and sparse of people and businesses: that can be good or bad. I suggest using the RTC bus as it runs along the strip (and into old LV) and costs $8 per day. Casino seems a bit small. Probably would book near the center of the strip next time although we did wander down there and it's long walking and crowded sidewalks.
20,For the price you could at least allow use of the fridge for personal things without a $50 Daily charge that is ridiculous put cheaper bottles of water for the room so then at least it’s affordable. $20 bucks for a 3 dollar bottle of water is a joke and then a $1 bottle is $3 in the vending machines. You pay for a better room to get the conveniences of a better hotel and not have to worry as much about shady people I’d rather deal with the homeless and crazies and stay on freemont or a regular motel and you would get more bang for your buck. And if your staying at the hotel you shouldn’t have to pay for Self Parking I get a valet fee but $15 bucks a day on top of resort fee (you would think that would be part of that charge as well as the pools) and to pay to get into the pool really? I might as well go to wet n wild at least that’s worth the money. And no complimentary anything no discount for breakfast or meals in general.
50,We've been here as a couple and with kids and there is plenty to do without leaving the casino. Our kids really enjoyed the beach and we enjoyed the lounges. Lots of places to eat as well and there is more than one Starbucks in there 😋
30,Our view of the pool was blocked by weird cross bars and the tv signal didn’t work at all unfortunately! Other than that we definitely enjoyed our stay but those slight things would have made all the difference.
40,Stayed here with my family mainly for the pool. Pool was super packed and basically impossible to find a chair. The room was great. Enjoyed the huge garden tub. Beds were super comfortable. Very disheartening to see them charge $28 for a tub for the lazy river. So ridiculous!
40,We stayed three nights here because of a family get together in the area. There’s a lot of distance to get around from front desk elevator front door and parking. In the room we found the tv didn’t work. They fixed it the next day after we reported it. The internet was slow the first day or two. Our neighbors were very noisy with their bouts of arguing while we were there. There were no wash cloths. There could be more outlets for charging our devices especially by the bed. We were afraid to touch things because of their policy of charging $50 if you use the refrigerator or move any of the bar items bottles of water etc. They even charged for the coffee. It makes one appreciate the chain motels’ amenities. On the plus side the room was large comfortable and clean. My hubby went to the pool with our grandson and they enjoyed it. We will stay somewhere else next time.
40,Room was spacious. Slow service at pool. Not overly crowded. Overall very pleased. During our stay the hotels water system was shut down for a short period of time. Slight inconvenience was up and running by morning. Wish they at least had free coffee in room.
10,"When we arrived the crib I requested wasn't there. I called to have them bring it. Ended up with a play pen. Also The room wasn't cleaned properly upon our arrival. I have a baby and needed to store her stuff in the fridge the fridge was locked. They tried to help over the phone and it didn't work. They promised to send someone from their ""mini bar team"" nobody ever came. Also they charge $50 A DAY ""storage fee"" to put your stuff in their refrigerator. That's insane. No thanks. I had to put ice water in the sink to cool my babies things. Also she got no sleep in the cheap play pen they brought me. I requested a CRIB. On their website it clearly states they provide CRIBS upon request. They need to edit that & put PLAY PEN. Nobody got any sleep with our unhappy 6 month old"
50,We visited LV after we got vaccinated. We got Comp room. Room was clean as usual. Not dated. We always stay at Mandalay bay. It is at the end of the strip but Excalibur and Luxor are close by. So if you don't want to play in Mandalay bay you can always hop to those two places. We had issue with the card for parking and the staff exchanged it with the working card. So far no issue and we were really happy. Nice bathroom and relaxing stay. The only thing was Lupo was closed when we were there (Monday and Tuesday). So we were disappointed for not able to dine at Lupo.
50,Great 4 days spent at a property that was clean courteous and polite. Check in was smooth and rooms were fantastic. Restaurant experience was good but still wishing for the buffet and other options. Definitely a place stay for a family or single person experience.
50,The room was beautiful and the quality of the bed and pillows were excellent felt like I was sleeping on air. The view was amazing and the staff was very attentive and friendly when help was needed..
50,The entire staff was awesome especially the M-Life Rewards Department. Highly recommend Mandalay Bay. Clean awesome food great pool. We stay here as often as we can & will always return. Heading bk in November and will stay there again.
10,The staff they have brought on after the pandemic is very rude has no idea what customer service is about and I do not go to Las Vegas to be treated the way I was at Mandalay Bay. This is a beautiful property with what used to be exceptional customer service; I hope this is only a temporary problem.
30,We waited too long for check-in and then on the third day of our trip there was a issue which resulted in not having water in our room for about 3 hours! Very unacceptable! Could have been accommodated better!
10,The hotel is just dirty. Garbages overflowing. Room service carts left in halls. Laundry bags left in halls. Do NOT try to get a cup of coffee on a Tuesday morning- waited 45 minutes! When calling the front desk I was on hold for 15 minutes. Restaurant choices are few.
50,We feel spoiled from arrival to departure. The staff at Mandalay Bay are so nice and accommodating. From start to finish. Even the casino ladies that fix the machines were so nice and helpful. They answered the light so fast! At the Belliagio I have waited for a half hour to retrieve my ticket from a machine. I highly recommend staying there. Get a massage!! It will start off your vacation perfectly!!
50,The room is spectacular and very roomy like a suite it was completely different than other casino rooms much smaller than those and the bathroom is so attached but mandaly bay room you feel like you want live on it.
30,The only reason to stay here is because of the pools or closeness to alligent stadium! Other than that poor room design (bathroom) less table games than other casinos some food choices are over priced and not that good
20,Mandalay Bay is very inconvenient navigating inside and out. The parking garage is at least a 10-15 min walk to the hotel rooms that’s if you know where your going. Anticipate additional time in all aspects at this resort. Room fee daily resort fee parking fee. Everything will cost you extra including drinking water$10-$20 per bottle. Elevators are packed and stop at every floor. I didn’t even see parts of this resort like the aquarium? Staff is very unfriendly and totally unhelpful! I didn’t here any jackpots going off the two days we stayed here either must not be a lucky spot either!! Highly recommend saving your insanity and booking somewhere else!!
10,Thought we had a great deal for a king suite on a Thursday night (date night) for $100. Check in was confusing because they told us we could do it online using our smart phones (iPhone 12) as room keys. Went to use the elevator and needed to hold our phones to the reader so we could select our floor. The WiFi was terrible so it wouldn't work so we went back down to the lobby and stood in line for a few minutes to get physical room keys - but then an employee approached us and said we could skip the line and go to express mobile check in where we could print keys. Perfect. Except when we got back from the pool our key still didn't work at the room! Back downstairs to get another set of key cards printed - what a pain in the ass. Other stuff that went wrong included TVs in the room that didn't work overcrowded pool with nowhere to sit (unless you want to reserve chairs for an extra cost of $100 per chair) $50 charge to just use the mini fridge (yes for personal items!). Parking is $15 daily to self park it used to be free for hotel guests but now they find more and more ways to just nickel & dime people. After resort fees tax parking it was way more than advertised. I work in luxury hospitality and this was super disappointing. I’d never stay here again or recommend to anyone.
20,The ice machine was down. Our card didn’t allow us to visit other floors. By chance we figured out that we could use the stairs to get to other floors. Sadly the other floors’ ice machines were also down!  The WiFi was absolutely terrible. Every time we tried to load any webpages to look at a menu or see what was near the page wouldn’t load.  Each and every morning between 4 and 5 there were people screaming in the hallway outside our room.  The TV feed cut out All. The. Time. The feed would freeze and/or skip.  There was no ventilation in the bathroom. And the door wouldn’t stay open so it was always warm and stuffy in there.
40,We took a last minute trip to Mandalay Bay. We have two boys under the age of 9. We were able to go to the Shark Reef we had a blast. The pools were nice but not so kid friendly. The lazy river was fast so not let your young ones go alone!! And the other pools weren’t kid friendly at all. There is a height requirement for the wave pool. Not much other activities for children but it’s Vegas right?
50,We really enjoyed our stay! The staff was welcoming and the pools were amazing. The only downfall was how far it is on one side of the strip. If you want to walk you still can but its going to be a longer walk.
20,The wave pool is great and testsurant were as well. The check in took 3 hrs and i bought 2 rooms. My 10 year old was in room number 2 with my sister and wasn’t even in the same wing as me. The shower backed up and black pipe rot come out of the bathtub. I had to shower from the bathroom sink for 2 days. The tv only worked on the first night. Horrible. However the wave pool was great and resterants too. The hotel managers were terrible.
20,Although the room is comfortable and spacious it was noisy and has connecting door from another room which gave us discomfort and unsafe on our first night until our last night of stay. On our first day we were so disappointed that there was a connecting door to our room I guess that’s how guests were treated when self-checking-in through mobile giving a room that have no choice option. On that first night while sleeping soundly we were shocked with our lives at 12:50 am when the connecting door suddenly opened and loud noises came from the guests in the other room. We were so shocked that we were not able to move and realized that the connecting door were not locked and we didn’t check it when we arrived we realized that the connecting door was not locked since the day we arrived until the snoopy guests from the other side opened it and almost barged in our room. Then on our last night early in the morning probably around 2-3am we were again woken up with loud noises from the other room there seem to be some kind of a fight and shouting that lasted for hours and so our rest night became restless and miserable.    Also my bill almost doubled up with charges that are unknown and didn’t consume. My receipt is not appearing on my MLife app and still have to request via email to get my receipt and review those charges.    Another thing there was no free parking for registered hotel guests just like Caesars which should be for registered guest seems so ironic that you could stay in MGM resorts but could not park and to be able to avail their free parking you need to level up to a certain tier which is kind of disgruntling. We are not gamblers but we stop by in vegas to eat and rest from our long road trips and take the kids to swimming it just happened that Mandalay Bay have the best review for pools so we shied away from Caesars Resorts and took it for the kids get rested from a week of driving before heading home to Los Angeles. Any motels or hotels or lodgings gives free parking for registered guests but MGM resorts was really a disappointing surprise and a displeasing first experience. It is not the best for kids to get them to Vegas but this is always a gateway from home to rest after visiting Utah and Arizona.    I would never rely on reviews again but will stick to what we know after such bad experiences in MGM Resorts so many hidden surcharges and the room we expected to be restful and peaceful became a nightmare. Ceasars Resorts stuck with their booking charges price including resort fees and taxes and stayed that way until check-out we had a grand time at Paris Hotel the last time but MGM Resorts is another matter.
30,Nice staff but no excuse for room quality after year+ of COVID. No upgrade offered in my first year of being Gold level. Insistence upon review minimum character count is RIDICULOUS and the ONLY place I've ever come across it. Might just be the WORST aspect of this experience.
20,Waited over an hour for bell service. Everything from fast food to basic room needs were way overpriced! I purchased a beverage in one of the convenience stores that would normally cost $5. It was $17!!!!
40,The room was nice but it seemed old and out dated. We did find trash from a previous guest and the bathroom had smudges on the wall. The hotel floor also smelled a little musty and old. But overall it was nice and we had a great time. I wish the buffet was open and I wish there was more food options because most of the places were closed because it was during the week (M-Th).  I love this hotel though and would come back regardless of how this trip went.
50,Had an issue of never receiving a gift basket that they said was delivered to my room but I never received it. Other than that I have nothing bad to say about Mandalay bay. Great pools too. I will definitely stay there again.
20,Disappointed. Better communication was needed. We understand service is not back to normal due to COVID. BUT if you're not able to provide housekeeping every day tell your guests! Left towels in the tub (after being used twice) and low and behold no housekeeping that day. Come back to get ready for dinner and we had to pull wet towels out of the tub to use! Called guest services and waited 20 min on hold for towels that wouldn't arrive before our reservations. Again we understand things aren't the same right now but communicate to your guests!  PS the shower drain was clogged as well.
50,Hotel and casino were very clean. The air smelled amazing. Pool area and lazy river was great. Room was fantastic. Rates were super reasonable. Some construction going on but I’m sure to only better the experience. It did not bother ours.
50,Extremely comfortable beds. Friendly staff throughout. Nice gaming area. Food a little expensive. Didn't use the pool area but looked very nice. We would definitely stay at Mandalay Bay next time we are in Vegas!
20,First and last time I will stay there !! Ice machine on floor broken. Waited 3 hours for coffee. Had to call 5 times before they came .. not so great experience!! I will not be returning to Mandalay Bay hotel !
40,Great hotel and glad we booked it. However it is at the very end of the strip and if we wanted to do ANYTHING at all we had to walk a long way. Normally we could use the TRAM at the Mandalay Bay and ride to the Excalibur (knocking out at least half a mile) however it was not running until our last day there.  The rooms were great and spacious however the service to the rooms was never timely. Several occasions when we contacted Guest Services (be prepared to wait on hold to talk to someone for at least 10 minutes) we asked for service. On one occasion it took a full 24 hours for someone to fulfill the request. So plan ahead if you need something.  Again great facility. The beach and pool area were great and fun for the kids. Prices are incredibly high but hey...that's Vegas.  Can't really speak to the Casino since I didn't partake in the gaming aspect of the resort. However you have to walk through it to go anywhere. However I did notice and made a mental note that it was very clean.  I'd recommend staying at this hotel just be aware of how much travel is involved in staying here.
40,hotel room was clean...beds were comfortable...pools were great other than the hot tubs excessive use of the chlorine(causing my daughters face to become chapped and painful)...staff was kind and knowledgeable...wish the room had a microwave and a fridge for leftovers from the amazing restaurants....
30,This a lovely hotel. The rooms don’t disappoint. Just be aware that they charge $15 daily for parking. Also be aware of extra charges on your statement. I was charged for coffee that I didn’t make for 2 days of my stay. I’m glad I checked my statement. But if I hadn’t I would’ve paid charges for refreshments that I did not use or purchase. Also there is no courtesy water. That’s a first for me. So I suggest you bring your own refreshments and a cooler. Lastly no courtesy coffee or use of the coffeemaker. You’ll be charged for using that as well.
50,We loved our stay at Mandalay Bay. We booked an Executive King and it was a beautiful room and was very clean. The wave pool and lazy river were both tons of fun and we wished we'd had another day to spend at the pool.    As per usual in Vegas hotels these days there is no fridge for guest use. Only the mini-bar and there is a $50 charge if a guest puts anything in the fridge at all. It would be appreciated if a 2nd empty fridge were in the rooms for guests to store water or leftover food.    Food prices on-site are high but the food quality was great.    We really enjoyed the digital check-in/out experience. We never even saw the front desk. It was wonderfully easy and handy!    Would stay here again.
20,If you're planning a trip to Vegas in the summer of 2021 lower your expectations. It's not fully open. At Mandalay Bay the poker tables aren't open. Room service stops at 9:00 PM and there's nowhere close by to get food at that point. Check in experience was crowded. They don't have enough staff and should possibly cap the number of reservations they're taking until they are able to provide the level of service you expect when staying at a nice hotel. We were really disappointed in our trip.
30,First of all Mandalay Bay Resort is just like every where else in the county. They can't get staffing! I had one day with no service in my room Another day the bed was made but nothing done in the bathroom. If staffing is the issue they should only accept reservations for the number of guess they have staffing Unlike so may post the AC in the room worked great. I also had no issues with the lighting. The room was very clean at check in. Many restaurants and shops are still closed. But during these touch times Mandalay Bay is trying to make everyone feel welcome. Normally I would give this location a 4 star today it's only 3. One shining star is the staff. They are extremely helpful.
10,Food court under construction water issues dirty bath tub no ice machine no refrigerator very underwhelming. Smelled like sewage everywhere- room lobby pool etc. Mlife issues. App issues. Will never stay here again.
20,This place is the most boring hotel we have stayed at yet . And do not waste money on the 5 mins shark experience thing booo . Not really any good eating there . It’s kind off like all show but no real action boring at night . summed up its boring
30,Took awhile for good service but pleased with how it was handled. The complimentary upgrade helped greatly with the inconvenience we experienced. The cleanliness of the Mandalay Bay rooms was nasty but our upgraded room was great at the Delano.
20,Multiple things wrong in the rooms. Ac didn’t work. Tv cable didn’t Work. Bath tub was clogged. When I reported the Ac not running they told me it was because it’s so hot outside. No other hotel has that problem
30,Check in and check out were easy. There’s an app for that. Pool was incredibly crowded but to be expected after a pandemic. Previous patrons left behind food in fridge and it wasn’t cleaned out prior to our arrival. They performed carpet repair/replacement the first morning there. Hammers screwdriver loud men...
30,As mentioned in the title the room was Fantastic and the Staff gives such good service. Unfortunately perhaps due to the lack of workers many of the restaurants were closed during our stay. Had to leave the resort to find something decent to eat!
30,Tram and most restaurants closed Sun-Thurs so we were limited on dining and travel. No shows. Ended up with a much smaller pool gazebo than others in our group and we paid $50 more. The room was nice.
40,I would give this hotel a higher rating on rooms and quality of sleep but the sheets were like sand paper and bed was too soft for my liking but the rooms are very beautiful. I never figured out how to use the mini bar.
10,The rooms are dirty and dusty. I felt like I couldn't breath. The staff was friendly and nice. This review is simply on how dirty the rooms are. We felt as if we were breathing dusty dirty air in the rooms.
40,Great trip friendly staff. Once you figure out the lay out of the casino floor it is easy to find food fun and access to the adjoining casino properties that keep you out of the heat and lose to the fun.
10,in room coffee would cost $60 between 10 for the coffee cup/supplies and a $50 restocking fee if you use any of the in room items  The app said my bag would be placed in my room as soon as they have my room number bur instead i had to call and WAIT IN THE ROOM for it to be brought up - no reason i should have to be there.  I have stayed there before but probably wont go back.
30,My boyfriend and I stayed at Mandalay Bay for our last night in Vegas. We were excited to stay here because it looked so nice and was different from the Caeser Resort we stayed at earlier in our trip. Our first issue was trying to figure out where to park. It was pretty confusing since the signs make it seem like the self parking is for the event center or the Delano and not the main Mandalay Building. Also if you stay there the parking is $15.00 a night. Had we known that parking was not going to be complimentary we probably would have stayed at a different resort. Our second issue we ran into was using the app as a our room key. If you're like me and have AT&T service isn't great in the elevator where you need your room key to get to the floor where your room is. So needless to say we took a couple rides on the elevator until a nice person used their card key to select our floor. Once we got to the room the phone key takes multiple attempts to open the door. Bit frustrating after driving all day. Then we found out that guests can't simply use the refrigerator. Cost $50 to use the fridge in the room for personal use. Overall was not impressed with this resort.
10,I can't tell you how disappointed I am with our visit. After several hours of waiting on our room  we joined a line of people ready to talk with someone. So we were given our rooms..... apparently on a floor that was not ready to be used. There was thrashed bagged up in the hall for over 12 hrs. The drink machines were empty. Ice machines not working. Too  Smelled. Air didn't work well. Most food sources still closed. I do realize they are having difficulties getting enough staffing now that Vegas is open .... but send me to one of your sister properties that has it together!!! Very dissatisfied. Will never stay there again.
50,We recently celebrated my sons 13th bday at Mandalay Bay. It was amazing! We rented the media suite which was great with wonderful views. We enjoyed the wave pool and the other pools. A really fun staycation!!
30,Our room had several problems and it took more than 3-4 calls to get someone on the phone to answer each time we discovered an issue. The light when you first walk-in was flickering. Our toilet room light didn’t work. We had to have someone fix our TV because it was out of service. The mini bar was missing several items and had bottles that were opened and half full. The bathroom smelled like urine our entire stay. Our bathroom door handle was loose hanging off halfway. The outside room door was missing the cover to the chip reader so it didn’t look like we were staying in a nice hotel. It felt like we were given a room that got trashed and was quickly put together for us to stay.
10,Check in was not delightful considering we waited several hours to get a room we had booked months in advance. Kept getting sent to different floors and room to find out that room was not available. My 70 year old mother in law had to be moved out of her room @ 3 am. Never received the food I ordered in room service. My 1 year old twins and 9 year old daughter had to wait i the lobby/elevator/hallways impatiently and hungry. It was embarrassing to have all the Mandalay guest hear my twins Crying of hunger
50,The pool and beach area and the wave pool and the lazy river were top notch!! My son and I had so much fun by the pools all day! The Shark Reef Aquarium was also nice. The rooms were very clean and the bathroom was very nice!
30,Website for panoramic view rooms are hit and miss with some providing only a view of the airport despite high price!  Rooms are nice and pool area is as well but very crowded and pricey for any food/drinks.
10,My room was not ready on time management said they were fully booked. Apparently that was my problem. My room was diry I had no toilet paper or clean towels management kept saying unsure when I would get them. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER
10,Pillowcases had someone's old blood on them. They want $50 for you to use the refrigerator in the room. They are charging $15 per night for parking- even for guests in the hotel. Food is expensive in Mandalay Bay.
20,Booked my 25th anniversary staycation at Mandalay after staying there for our 5th back in 2001. Told them it was my anniversary prior to checking in and got stuck on the 4th floor with a view of the roof of the entrance. Asked for an upgrade after we had to wait over an hour and a half after the check in time and was told they couldn't accommodate so they told me they would give me a 100 dollar hotel credit which we never received. Overall the room was nice though (executive suite) very spacious. The ice machine on our floor was broke our entire stay and because you need a key to access your selected floor we couldn't get to another floor to get ice. I literally had to venture out daily to the nearest gas station to fill my cooler and get ice for drinks. Also had one day where the maid didn't leave any towels. Other than that the pool area was pretty sweet the drinks were tasty and we made the most of it. Won't go back to the Bay anytime soon with so many other properties to choose from after such an uninspiring staycation.
50,Very nice rooms and clean casino. Staff was very friendly and attentive when asked questions. Had some issues with self-parking but it was resolved immediately. A few minor problems with the ice and.vending machine on our floor not working but not a big deal. Slot play was decent!
30,Quick vacation enjoyed the red Rory a lot of things closed although website said otherwise. Also watch your bill before checkout I had charges to my room that I never made had to get it fixed before checking out which added y  Unnecessary stress
50,Always have a great time at Mandalay Bay. Pool Casino and restaurants are great. MLife takes great care of us while we are there and makes us want to keep coming back. Whenever we get back we start planning our next trip.
50,Simply beautiful and special above most other hotel & casinos. This place is unforgettable. The pool and food is everything and more. Easy check in and out. If you haven't stayed her than you ate not enjoying your travel.
40,Went with family and they really enjoyed the pool. Good service overall. Our clogged sink was fixed quickly. Pool was crowded. We got a cabana which was great albeit expensive in my opinion at $525. Rate is good but they charge extra for everything. Parking is thoroughly confusing. It not bad at $15/day. Rooms nice and clean but loud. Ours had an adjoining door which is nice when you need two rooms which we did but rest of my family was placed across the hall. So instead of convenient I had to hear a group of 4 ladies all night. Also you can hear all the doors slamming of nearby rooms. Checkin line was long. Probably would stay again due to good service and good rates.
10,This hotel was terrible. First and last time I will stay here. I came alone with my 5 children and we checked in at 9 am. I understand rooms may not be ready till 4pm at check in time but after 5 trips to the counter to check our room status we finally got a rom at 12:30pm!!!! We waited over 15 hours to get in our room. What kind of hotel just says housekeeping is running behind and doesn’t give their guests a room???? Then after midnight when we finally got in a room that I began bathing my kids for the night to get them to bed and midway through the second shower still with shampoo in my Fargo hair all the water was shut off!!!! We had to rinse her hair out with bottled water and 5 of us didn’t even get to bathe. We finally got into bed and asleep close to 2 am and guess what happened next? We were awaken at 7am to a loud alarm going off for 15 min. We could not go back to sleep and it was a nightmare. Please do better Mandalay Bay but I will not be staying here ever again.
50,Went there with my husband and 3 children. We had a great experience with the pool. Kids loved the wave pool and lazy river. We also enjoyed the Shark encounter. Didn't have to leave the property much. My only complaint it that we had to call the front desk 3 times and all 3 calls we waited over 5 mins for someone to answer then get transferred and wait again and when we did get someone on the line for 2 of the calls they couldn't provide us with an answer. But I would stay again with my family.
30,Had to stay here for volleyball tournament. Was disappointed that you could see into bathroom from sleeping area (not private at all). Towels were pretty worn out. For $430 for two nights it was quite disappointing.
30,The place is becoming dated food options are terrible service is so-so the quick mart has no pricing on the items because they charge outrageous prices beverage service stinks however the dealers and supervisors are very nice.
20,Most of the restaurants were closed. Most of the table games were closed (3-4 black jack tables open with every seat packed and people waiting to sit) The charge for self parking The rooms were old and the bathrooms had mould and broken fixtures
50,We checked in early using the mobile app and digital key. We went straight up to our room and avoided the check in line. We printed keys later at a kiosk it was really fast. Exploring all the pools was fun especially the wave pool.
50,Mandalay has provided exceptional service and made sure that all of the residents and staff felt very safe and welcomed in both the hotel and casino floor. Hotel room was very clean and I had no problems with anything breaking no smells etc.
30,The hotel is one of the better resort for those with children due to the pools and kid friendly attractions. It is on the far end of the strip and quite a distance from the action of the strip - this would be great if you’re just in the area on business.    We had very noisy neighbors and the front desk is difficult to get ahold of.    The mobile check in is nice WHEN you have service! Still needs work.
30,Everything was good. Until we got to our room to take a shower and use restroom and wash hands there was no water for hours. Others in our floor had same issue . Also no ice machines worked for a hot weekend in Vegas not a good experience
10,Do not stay here!!! Room was so hot! Did not sleep all night. Long lines to get on the elevators with no staff or guidance on people just pushing through. I really would stay anywhere in Vegas but here
40,Ok so all in all not bad but the ac in my room was loud I didn't make a big deal out of this issue due to the fact I was not staying that long.The view from my room was vents and roof 3 323 was the room please check the a.c. I will spring for the upgrade next time. On a good note the rooms are very clean. I was unable to book a spa day with the app and no one answered the phone it cool if you don't want my money. The sea breeze Cafe was great all around you out of your mind if any one going to pay your min bar prices.
30,Comps and credits aren’t guaranteed. We didn’t automatically get the credits and after an hour of waiting to get it corrected it never was. Pool area chairs were extremely dirty. I’m not sure if I’d come back again by choice when there are so many other better options.
30,Over all good hotel. A sink in my room was clogged & the toilet leaked water. These issues could have been resolved before hand. Also it was not pleasant not having water service during my last night there.
50,This was my birthday and my first trip to Vegas. I stayed at Luxor for the first two nights but will be loyal to Mandalay from here on out after spending my last night there. The room was clean cool and well-stocked. Check in and out was so simple.
20,After a fantastic stay at MGM Grand this week we decided to spend our last night in Vegas at Mandalay Bay. We couldn’t have been more disappointed in the property. The escalators were broke which was a huge inconvenience. The tram still isn’t up and running which is sad since all the others are. We were so excited about spending time by the pool which was a joke! No seat to be found and we checked throughout the day. The ice machine on our floor was broke and the cleaning lady on the floor suggested we walk up or down to another floor. (Which you have to do because of the key situation in the elevator.) After checking 7 floors no ice! How can 7 floors all be down. 4 out of the 7 floors also had pop machines out of order. Tried calling using the room phone to not only notify someone it didn’t work but to have someone possibly bring some up. Called twice sat on hold way to long and we just hung up. Compared to the MGM Grand staff this staff was not very helpful or friendly. We stayed on floor 14 and the halls had a funny smell. Not sure what resort fees cover but this was a miserable stay. The good things were the view mobile check-in and clean bathroom. For the money you be much better off staying elsewhere.
20,after an aggressive 11 day 6 national park tour i wanted to spoil my family with a night in a suite on or near the strip in las vegas before we flew back home. we are a family of 5 room capacity is 4 at most resorts so it was 2 rooms at around $400 or a suite. after checking websites i found the “two queen panaramic view suite” at mandalay bay for $550. at 1450sq ft it had plenty of room 2 bathrooms 2 queen beds and a king bed. as an “m life” member we booked and checked in via mobile devices. upon arrival we stopped at the desk friendly helpful service by woman at the counter. kids were excited as we told them we were doing something special for the final night. walking down the hallway to suite 9-335 we noticed a room service tray with crusted food on the floor outside room 9-332. opened the door of the suite and at first glance it was very impressive. kids put their backpacks in their room my wife and i did the same. my son called out “dad you should see this”. he was pointing at pizza crust and an m and m left in the trash can. i told him not to worry about it. we wanted to take in the strip and get something to eat. my wife went to put her bag in the wardrobe in the king room and noticed the hinge was hanging off the door inside the king bed bathroom there were two places the ceiling had been patched but not painted and there was a tear in the sheetrock above the jet tub. the right inside doorknob of that bathroom was falling off. there was a party streamer left by a previous guest hanging off the sprinkler head in the main living area by the mini fridge. there was a sharp screw missing it’s rubber cap sticking out of the base moulding (supposed to be a door stop) and the wallpaper was peeling both in the entry way. i didn’t even look in the kids bedroom or bathroom.    the “view”? if you want to look at the airport the football stadium or the roof of the lobby and casino this is the room for you. you also have a partial pool view. if you booked this room thinking you’d get a room with a view of the strip 9-335 is not for you. if you want to be embarrassed by the quality of the maintenance and housekeeping crew especially after you’ve told your family you were doing something special for them and paid $500 for one night this is the room for you.    many restaurants in the resort were not open and construction crews were using a jackhammer to break up the floor in the lobby at 12:30am when we were returning from our night out. room service dishes with crusted food on it inviting roaches were still on the floor when we were checking out at 10:30am the next morning. the dishes had been on the floor of the hallway for 21 hours. after the trip i sent two emails over 10 days asking if management would like to respond to the pictures and management has not reached out. mandalay is not ready for post covid crowd based on our stay. in my email i wrote that i could understand some of the maintenance issues as many places had to cut back on staff due to covid but the housekeeping……food and dishes on the hallway for for at least 21 hours food not cleaned out of the trash can in our room is totally unacceptable. it’s a sign that someone on staff doesn’t care.
10,We are frequent visitors of Vegas and have stayed just about everywhere on the strip. We were beyond excited leading up to our stay at Mandalay Bay. We got the vip arrival package and were thrilled with the communication and assistance pre-arrival. Our driver to the hotel was excellent. His name was Danny and he was everything we could hope for and more. We pulled up to the beautiful hotel and were escorted to our VIP check-in. The desk staff were very short but we understand that most places are understaffed and overworked so I looked beyond that. We got up to our room and found that there was a large leak under our sink. We instantly called to have someone come up and fix it. We were told there would be a wait so we went to dinner in hopes that it would be fixed by the time we returned. We came back that night and the towels we had put under the sink were still there. I called again later to ask if it had been fixed and we were told that it was. We picked up the towels and went to bed. I got up to use the restroom in the middle of the night and had to catch myself on the bathroom sink because I nearly fell. I called again to advise the front desk of our issue. They said they would have an engineer come up. No customer service was present during any of this. The staff who answered the phones were not empathetic at all and didn’t even offer to move us into a new room. The ice on our floor was out the wait for ice according to in-room dining was close to 2 hours and we had to pay to use the refrigerator. We spent close to 3 hours total trying to get from floor to floor to find ice. That was challenging because we could only get onto our floor with our room key. My mother in law who was across the hall had numerous issues with her room keys not working had to wait in line for 30 minutes or more 4 different times to get a key. Her safe was busted so she had to use ours and her bathroom doors wouldn’t even shut properly. She too spent a ton of time trying to find ice. I understand that Covid has presented major issues with revenue and staffing but I was most disappointed in the lack of customer service. For a hotel of this caliber it was unacceptable and I don’t know that I can share any positive experiences with friends and family because of how many issues we had. I really love the pool area and think it’s a fun atmosphere but your customers should come first. Nobody asked how our stay was at check-out the vip lounge staff on our way out were rushing us they were rude and made us feel burdened for asking questions. There were guests behind us telling the desk staff about a hostile potential robbery attempt at 2:00 am that morning and the lack of empathy and emotion for them was just sad. I’m very disappointed and certainly hope that the quality improves because your customers will eventually stop coming back.
50,Love this hotel service hotel always clean  their drinks my favorite bloody mary. quiet beautiful view. Pools are amazing hotel stuff very helpful and friendly. will be going back to take our grandkids to enjoy wonderful pools
40,Room are the same as when we stayed there 20+ years ago. The Citizens Kitchen & Bar was closed when the sign said OPEN during construction. The complimentary baggage service need to improve (maybe a bar code system) there was a line of 30 people picking up and like 4 workers.
40,The only reason I’m giving them 4 stars is because they don’t have a fridge to use and provide coffee . Come on all the hotels give coffee for free and they charge too much for a cup a coffee if you touch one of their products in the freeze.
50,Stay was wonderful from beginning to end. Any time there was an issue it was resolved immediately. We traveled with our teenagers and it’s very family friendly. The wave pool and lazy river were perfect in the desert heat. Food was delicious. The hotel smelled great every where except the casino floor. The room was extremely clean and spacious. I highly recommend especially for families.
20,Was not happy with my stay. Rooms are better at other MGM properties. I stayed in a suite and was not even close to what I was expecting. My prior stay at the Bellagio was exceptional. Cleanliness is another factor
10,awful. just awful. check in go to the room. still dirty. literally feces ON the toilet. waited 2 hours for someone to clean the room. only cleaned up the feces. another 45 minutes to get a room change. thanks for removing the $30/night resort fee. miserable staffing. terrible customer service. left a facebook message for their response thursday at check in got a reply on monday.
40,Grate Place for family and if you are just going with friends would recommend to anyone. Also grate price depending what time of the year you go. Would definitely recommend going to the pool had a lot of fun there and also the gym not that bad.
50,Nice room and comfortable bed. Clean property. Staff was friendly and helpful. Pools were nice (a bit crowed) Nice to see vegas getting back to normal. Mobile check was a nice feature so you didn't have to wait in the check in lines!
30,The overall experience was not so fun because of what happened with my room and the miscommunication between the staff and i we loved the pool and we loved the beach and webwere treated very nice there for sure
50,Super nice family friendly place to stay on the strip. Never had to leave the property. Even extended my stay for a night. Favorite hotel I’ve stayed at on the strip so far! The pool is the BEST! Book here especially if you have kids :)
50,We went and stayed on a couples weekend. It was awesome amazing staff amazing  pools were amazing. Kevin at Moorea were amazing highly recommend. Accessibility is really easy and ease is awesome so don't miss out.
20,First room was 75 degrees Second room was the same and Third room wasn’t any better Our rooms were 75 degrees and we were so hot we couldn’t sleep Hotel was nice but very un happy....This was the first time i’ve had bad experience in las vegas
50,Loved everything about the Mandalay. Great location with tram service to the heart of the strip. Lazy river and pool are great. Food and drinks are expensive but that’s pretty much expected. It’s basically it’s own city you don’t need to leave if you don’t want to. They have everything. We had a great time!
40,The room we were in was nice and comfortable. Overall it is a nice hotel and our daughter was at the pool the last two days we were there with her teammates. There are many restaurants to choose from if you want to try and eat. Border Grill is a good Mexican Restaurant and reasonably priced. You can also walked around the casino and go through The Shoppes at Mandalay Bay and it will take you to Luxor and then through Excalibur without having to walk outside the hotel. It was also convenient to walk to the Mandalay Convention Center as it is connected to hotel. We would come back to this hotel.
10,I think them being closed for covid has made them out of practice. Room was dirty- dirt/sand in sheets. Housekeepers had to come out to room at 11:30pm. Valet technology wasn’t working right resulting in no one knowing where my car was.
50,The Stay Well room was great. Best sleep I have had in months with the air cleaner diffuser and amazingly comfortable bed. Add to that the shower with the cholerine removal filter made it into a couple nights to remember. Staff was fantastic in all interactions and the lounge act we stumbled upon late night was something to remember. Definitely looking forward to my next stay
30,Seems like the room was big ready for post COVID stays. Room was it clean and TV did not work. Lost of restaurants not open yet. They also are not transparent on applying good and beverage credit. They require you Tobias it daily and not bank it on your trip. So do not save it up.
50,The hotel was conveniently located and the staff did an excellent job with our every need. The kids really enjoyed the wave pool and the lazy river. We had very pleasant dining experiences at Lupo's as well at StripSteak.
30,"Upon arrival there was some sort of ""goop"" all over our shower wall and floor the bathtub was covered in grit and my nightstand has some sort of I don't know ""gunk"" on it. If it had been clean it would have been an AMAZING room but it definitely was not cleaned or at least not properly. And then a $300 dollar hold was placed which was not a problem but I was told only $140 of it would be charged (resort fees) instead a total of $270 was charged which is crazy since I had to clean my room and left it in BETTER condition than which I received it. I cant say if I will be returning to this hotel but I can say I WON'T be recommending it after all that."
30,Beautiful resort that normally offers so many amenities not this time. Most restaurants were closed the ones open were VERY expensive. Pool allowed non outsiders tram was closed gambling was horrible
30,I expect better service. This experience overall makes me not want to stay in your resort ever again. My entire family was disappointed and tired. We basically waisted one entire day waiting on our rooms. That money went to waist. The staff weren’t friendly or willing to negotiate anything at all.
50,I really enjoyed the restaurants located in the hotel as well as the rooms; they were very clean. Another good and relaxing thing to enjoy was the beach. Overall it was a great experience and highly recommend.
40,The wave pool and lazy river are awesome. Bring your own single floatie and you can air it up there. Sandy beach vibe is great listening to the waves.    All was not good however. Before check in called and requested a room on high floor with view of strip. Did not get it. Digital check in was great just didn’t get requested room.    Then the guest room we were given had a reverberating pulsating whirring sound (8-114...avoid this room!!) that drove us nuts. We were moved to a different room and floor and upgraded to an executive suite.    They will nickel and dime you to death. We called and requested empty plates/bowls and silverware to eat with and they wanted to charge us $12 for it. If you move a Starbucks cup in your room you’ll get charged for it as if you used it..we were charged $22 for that and successfully got them to remove it.
30,This hotel was more concerned about every single cent they could make charging $10 for water and at any turn they wanted to charge you something. The service was very mediocre in several of the bars and apparently the bartenders were overpaid because they weren’t worried about their tips at all. Nor would they offer you a second beverage even if they weren’t busy. The rooms were mediocre and nothing about this hotel was overly impressive.
30,Nice hotel & pool area. It was relatively quiet. Its just out of the way from the action. Gambling is wayy too expensive. $25 minimum on BJ & craps. I mean I go to Vegas to spend money but thats just too steep for me. We ended up mostly gambling down at the Flamingo & Linq. Mandalay is a decent hotel for kids.
20,Checked room was occupied and dirty! We payed for a 2 queen beds! The room that we got was not 2 queen beds! Was smaller! Room key was not working for the parking so more USD15 everytime we needed our car !  Awful service for a high price! Seems like the staff does not know how to provide a exceptional service anymore!
50,First time in Vegas and I'll tell you Bill made it the best experience of my life! Shout out to Phill Phillip David & Jane! Go and stay at this casino & resort and ask where these people are they will TREAT YOU RIGHT! Make sure you talk to them because that's their favorite part of the job! See y'all soon!
30,Great property with tons to do and easy access to neighboring Mgm properties. The beds are extremely firm and the pillows are lumpy. The shower and tub could have been cleaned better. Visited two months ago and the customer service was stellar and the cleanliness was too. Not quite sure what the change was in the last two months.
50,Love the generouse comps and room upgrades available. Our room had a wonderful mountain view. We got great service at both the check-in and MLife club desks. The casino is nice and spacious but the slots were a little tight. It was difficult to find a waitress in some areas of the casino and it takes a while between when you order a drink and when they bring it. Overall a good stay though!
10,Vegas is my home away from home and the majority of the time I have a great experience win or lose. This time I booked a room a few months early as a group of friends and I looked to enjoy the memorial day weekend. The trip started great with a visit to Peggy Sue's then early arrival 1:30pm to Mandalay Bay but from the moment I began check-in the trip nalstaga wore off. Our 2 bedroom panoramic view suite was no longer available and instead we were downgraded to a king suite with a 2 queen connector no room rate adjustment. My group of 8 had to wait in a two queen room until the rooms were avaiable. We didnt get our room until 7-9pm because of shift change and a cleaning issue in the rooms bath tub. More inconveniences and delays from the start and they offered a 200 food comp and the front desk clerk felt that was more than enough when i discussed the issue we've been experiencing. As an Mlife member and frequent Vegas goer this was by far the worst experience I've had at a hotel and with hotel staff. Their conflict resolution was lacking and their communication was equally as bad. Mandalay Baybwas not the place to stay. Vegas was great Mandalay Bay ain't.
20,There was no A/C in the room during the summer. Guest services didn’t help. I wish the pool was open longer because it was hot even at night. We love Mandalay but the night we stayed was terrible. You can’t have your rooms A/C not working properly in the summer.
40,This trip was phenomenal ! We traveled and stayed at Mandalay Bay as a graduation trip. Although the hotel is farther up the strip the hotel has taxis that come and do pickups all throughout the day ! We stayed in the penthouse sky view suite and the view was phenomenal! Housekeeping came by everyday and cleaned the room ! This hotel is also great for families. There are so many restaurants inside and the Mandalay Bay shark reef aquarium was amazing ! The wave pool and lazy river was great too ! We will definitely be back !
20,Tried checking in early at 12:30 to see if we could get rooms early. We wanted connecting or same floor rooms. Was told we could get same floor but they weren’t ready just yet. Killed time in the casino and at 4:00 (past normal check in time) we didn’t get the QR code yet. I went to the line for people with codes and a worker in a sports jersey was helping people there. I told him I didn’t have the QR code yet so he said the room isn’t ready then. He said there’s lots of other people waiting as well and that so many thousands of rooms needed to be cleaned. I asked if there was a way to check how long it will be and he nonchalantly said “nope”. I told him we had a dinner we needed to get ready for and he just shrugged his shoulders. I don’t know if the hotel just hired some random guy for the day cause he wasn’t dressed like he worked there nor did he have any manners or customer service skills. We waited till almost 6pm when we stood in the checkin line again and asked for any room doesn’t need to be same floor and if at least one room was ready. They said they had both rooms available but not on the same floor which we would have been fine with if they told us the wait for same floor rooms was going to be after 6-7pm. We flew on the red eye so this whole checkin ordeal ruined our first day in Vegas.
40,Wonderful stay during a very busy holiday weekend. Disappointed in the casino which again allows smoking which affected air quality cleanliness and even the odor when removing you clothing after a visit. Park casino (no smoking) was worth the trip.
40,The Resort was nice rooms were clean the staff were friendly. Check in and out on your phone so no lines. (Use the MGM app). If your not a Marijuana user you might want to avoid the outside areas of the resort. (Valet area. Pick up/ Drop off area). With the new Marijuana laws or lack there of Vegas is definitely not family friendly. The tram is also nice to get around.
50,Great experience wave pool at Mandalay Beachside was good.  Excellent rooms and staff. The comps could have been better but overall a good experience. Good food in all restaurants. Nice to be connected to Luxor.
20,Instead of being treated like a valued guest i felt as if everything was turned into a standoff. I had to go down to the main desk a number of times because charges were applied to my room and not deducted from my express comps like i was told would happen. If i wouldn’t have checked the mgm app on my phone i wouldn’t have known and my “incidentals” deposit would have been charged. It could just be a one off instance but left a bad taste in my mouth.
10,"Sooo disappointed! 112 degrees outside and no air! Over 90 in the room. Took us 24 hrs 4 phone 2 visits to a manager to get a room with air! Unacceptable! When you go downstairs to guest relations (because they don't pick up their phone after 30 minutes of ringing). Management and guest serviced are too busy worrying about how they are so ""better than you"" and have such an attitude! They say the condition of the room isn't THEIR fault...well Mr Manager..Your the damn manager and this is YOUR hotel..be a man and take responsibility- ""Bobby""! I have stayed at Bellagio...Cesar's AMAZING service! Honestly stay there!! You can honestly get better service at a Motel 6! Mandalay you SUCK!!"
50,I booked on the MLife website and booked the VIP experience. If you have an opportunity to do this I would absolutely recommend it. The staff is very professional and went out of their way to help in any way they can. Love the pool area at this hotel. We rented a cabana for the day and it did not dissappoint.
40,Express Check-in is a great idea but the digital key won’t work in the elevator. The pool is amazing I wish it stayed open later. I love that the room has a refrigerator but you can’t use it for personal use. The food and drinks are pricey. A bottle of water at the hotel gift shop was $5 it’s only $3 at the vending machine. All  Of the escalators work at Mandalay Bay...I can’t say the same for the other hotels we visited. The staff was very friendly and the hotel was clean. The bed was comfortable and we had plenty of towels. Overall it was a nice trip.
10,We stayed 5 nights had cleaning service come 1x as they would try to come at random times ‘due to COVID’. We had to put the trash out ourselves and it just sat in the hallway for over 24 hours. We used to love this place for families I’d look somewhere else.
40,This was my fifth or sixth trip to Vegas. I’ve had nicer rooms comped in the past but it had been a couple years since going so I understand not getting the super premium rooms this time around. Gf and I mainly went for the pool so it was still 100% worth it. Was a but disappointed most of the shows and clubs were closed for covid reasons I’m assuming. All in all would def recommend Mandalay Bay to anyone wishing to visit Vegas. They do have some excellent dealers on the casino floor and I actually left Vegas with more money then I came with which is obviously pretty rare 😆.
20,Mandalas Bay used to be one of the best casinos with his pool and rooms unfortunately this time that I stayed here rooms needed more care  bathrooms floor was not cleaned and zing was watering  I had 2 complementary nights and I was charge for this .
50,We only stay at Mandalay/Delano when we come to Vegas. The convenience of it being located at the end of the strip makes it so easy to leave and go other places without fighting traffic. The pool is where it’s at!!!! The lazy river is so relaxing. Would totally recommend especially if it is your first time to stay in Vegas.
40,As mentioned on page one. The older craps dealers acted as though they hated their job and they lacked skill. One of them would just toss you winnings instead of placing them and one of them shorted me by more than $100 and the box man seemed to be irritated at me for pointing it out.
10,Ice machine broken on our floor and only given a key usable for ONE time only EACH! Therefore had to go purchase an ice chest to avoid multiple trips to the front desk waiting in LONG LINES for multiple keys for multiple days of ice machine outages because they don’t have enough people staffing the front desk. Refrigerator in the room is not for use by the guests but instead a money pit for the hotel. But wait for $50 I can empty myself and use it. Wtf does my $200 in resort fees pay for??? Also back to staffing we called the front desk multiple times and literally put the phone on speaker for the length of entire tv shows and NEVER got an answer!!! The electric mirror/tv did not work nor did the lights on the makeup mirror.
20,Dead cockroach in room  housekeeping did not even clean my room on day 1  asked to have my room cleaned the next day at 8 am came back from a tiring day and room still not cleaned at 4 pm. Poor slow response/service considering how much their room rates were.
20,I had issues with the room from the very start. Off the bat one of the waters in my room was opened and drank. I called to make sure I wouldn't be charged but sure enough it was on my account and I had to argue with them on it.  2nd I had 2 boys with me in an Executive King- yet NO extra bedding for the pull-out. Where did they think 3 people were going to sleep? Of course didn't figure this out till late at night - and it took an hour for the bedding to come.  3rd First night the bathroom toilet room reeked of smoke we couldn't take it after the frist night so I called asking for something to be done. They did come and the smell seemed gone however by the end of the 2nd night smoke was back and continued till we left.  Missing remote control gum on the side of the desk.    Ridiculous overpriced for soda for kids- $6 or $12 for a fountain drink? Give me a break. I get it - its vegas but seriously.  Also no kids menu for breakfast so let me spend $20 for my kids pancakes.
10,Kept getting shocked by room door. Food court to far from room. No microwave charger a 400 dollar hold which we was unaware of the self check in did not work when we first arrived so we had to drag all our bags back down stares
30,The staff is very rude and they don’t act like they care if you are there or not. The rooms are hot.  No one checks on you in the casino we spent 2 hours our first night there and no one offered us a drink.
50,It was a good time with the family and always is when we stay at Mandalay Bay the kids love it and my wife and I have a great time. We try to stay there every time we go really enjoy the pool and the night life
10,Several of the amenities were closed. Many of the restaurants were closed (and you're at the end of the strip so far from everything else!). Almost no umbrellas at the pool (but you can pay $450 for a cabana!). The final indignity was paying $15 to park in a half empty parking lot. But it was worth it just to leave.    Oh and the wifi sucks. So don't try to have a zoom meeting while you're there.    So many other hotels on the strip don't waste your time or money here.
20,"We usually stay at Delano but decided to try Mandalay this time. (we like the pool) I'm going to chalk some of the ""trash problems"" up to people who may not normally go to Vegas there spending stimulus money. A couple of times we got on an elevator to find literal trash thrown on the floor. Fast food bags stepped on junk food etc. multiple floors were without ice so we ordered some from room service with a few cans of soda for a smooth $50."
50,This is my husband and I second forth trip to Vegas and our second stay at mandalay bay. We had family fly out from different states who also stayed here. We will be returning to this hotel with kids!
30,food never arrive at pool and when the manager got involved-order was taken again and items were incorrect.  shower head was old and broken.  came back fro pool all day to find my shower was flooded with crap out of the drain.....smell was bad.  took 5 phone calls to get tech to come out-manager didn't apologize at all.....and we almost missed our dinner reservations.
40,Can't wait to go back. Wave pool was awesome. Hotel was beautiful. All the staff was very friendly. Able to check in early. Accommodated all my requests. Drink service was good at the slots. Overall great experience..
30,Be prepared they are gonna make back the money they lost last year. 45.00 resort fee...ok expected and tax on the fee! 10.00 for 2 cups of coffee in your room. 50.00 to put something in the refridgerator
20,Wouldn’t want to experience this ever again...no towels tried to charge for things we didn’t receive...the price was sufficient I guess for service received...the only thing that was good was the beach
50,Everything was great  From room cleanest to service  Bell desk service war amazing they took care of our luggage for a couple of hours.    Except for one day we were without water for 6 hours between 8am and 2 pm
50,I stayed 3 nights at Mandalay Bay  everything was 5 stars from check in to check out  it's a bit of a walk to get to the strip  unfortunately the tram was down at the time  that was the only downside as this is the first hotel in the strip
50,Great base room for the price. We got comped 2 free nights. First time here and would return again. Spacious and restaurants were great. Dined at libertines and House of blues. Both did not disappoint! Great service.
50,This was one of the nicer hotels on the strip. Clean comfy awesome pool variety of good food nice staff and very safe. There was a security presence 24-7 not like in an overbearing way you'd just see them out of the corner of your eye walking the area.
40,Loved the pools and the staff in the beach areas were very attentive. The beds were very comfortable but the hallway noise was loud. The floor staff not as attentive as in some other casinos. The ice machine was broken and they never brought the ice to the room that the desk ordered for us.
50,I had a great stay the rooms are large and they are very mindful of what you need while traveling for business. The bathrooms are great if you would like a full size tub or a shower. The self check in made my check in very quick and I could use my phone as a key if I choose not to pick up a room key or I forgot it in my room.
50,I chose this hotel for my daughter. We love using the beach and lazy river however it was mad crowded due to Memorial weekend. I would suggest renting a cabana to avoid looking for chairs since there were none around.  Convenient tram that takes you to the Luxor and Excalibur too!  There’s several restaurants to eat at.  Sea breeze Cafe serves breakfast and lunch. We had awesome seats overlooking the pool area.  Our room was at the end with pool view also.  Best to get the end room since it was quiet and not loud. But hallway smelled of weed  Mandalay is also connected and there’s a walkway to Luxor too!
30,When I got to my room there was cigar paper in the floor and earrings as well I call to the lobby over 4 time to get ice to my room since the ice Machine wasn’t working and I never received it ..😑😑😑😑😑
40,I was there for USBC Nationals and Mandalay Bay was close. M-life staff was great. Your staff kept the casino clean.You have a lot of things to keep everyone busy. The beach was a great time love the lazy river. The only thing was when I went to leave 5/2/2021 I was unable to get out with out calling for service not happy with that.
30,There were a lot of questionable activity that required security intervention a lot of marijuana smoking inside the hotel pool area on our floor. The room we stayed in had stained sheets hallway reeked of marijuana. Not a good experience with kids. We were four in the room yet daily we got no more than 3 towels.
50,Staff was friendly the facility was clean and my room was clean as well. I will be returning after COVID to experience more of the pool amenities. Check-in line went quick and the shops were friendly and quick as well
30,Mandalay Bay is quite isolated from the main action of the strip. It will be in good location when the NFL season begins or big concerts at the Allegient Stadium. If you want to enjoy the other amenities on the Las Vegas strip bring comfortable walking shoes or use ride share services.
50,Had a great experience here! Love this hotel the rooms are clean casino is inviting and pool is awesome! I’ve stayed here before and I plan on staying again in the future! I recommend this hotel to everyone!
50,"Far enough from the strip so you are not bothered by the crazies. Loved the wave pool and lazy river. Pricey restaurants in the casino. We found better pricing options in the ""Shoppes at Mandalay Bay"" (the little mall area between Mandalay Bay and Luxor). You need to check out Slice of Vegas and RiRa's Irish Pub. Both had excellent food a decent price. Loved having the ability to walk from Mandalay Bay and Excalibur using inside walkways out of the heat outside."
30,Looking online seen it was a 5 stars not maybe a 4 to 3 room was not up to part. When I call for something it took one day to get back after I called again. The room was not clean the bathtub dirty...
50,The resort was a great getaway spot for couples and families. The beach/pool was great restaurants were a convience. Rooms were very comfortable. Came for a weekend/ birthday getaway had a wonderful time. I would definitely recommend the Mandalay Bay!
50,Had a great time with friends I frequent this place and bought a group of friends for the 1st time they loved their stay and are coming back next monththe pools are great staff and Casino host exceptional !!
20,Have stayed in many casinos and played many machines. I understand the odds and have fun playing them losing most of the time. But at the Mandalay I'm just not sure the gaming board has been around lately to check. All games were not only sluggish on payouts they refused bonuses except in extremely rare situations. It's as if they turned everything off to try to make up for 6 months of closing in 2 weeks. It was so bad it was noticeable. Went to another property and found standard game play. Mandalay is just highly questionable at this point in my mind. It was EXTREMELY odd. It was certainly not random or at least the random I've experienced in the past 35 years.
40,Everything was great except for not telling guests why the wave pool was being cleared and not informing us how long it was going to be until we could return back in. Orher than this discrepancy it was all good.
40,It’s been said in many other reviews. Super expensive in room water $20 and coffee $10. That’s unacceptable for me. Resort fee is supposed to cover WiFi but it was awful. On the 21st floor and beyond. Really shocking with what they charge. Pool is great. If you order food at the pool brace yourself. Overall we loved our stay however.
40,I enjoyed the stay. Wifey approved which means will be returning. My baby boy loved the pool and was amazed at the shark reef. My oldest boy loved the Resturants. My wifey loved the rooms and gambling and stores. I love how accessible to other casinos.
50,I noticed Mandalay Bay sees to every single smallest of details in their guest dealings and in their property. From the smallest care such as placing a little peice of plastic on the in-room dining breakfast coffee cups under the lid (to prevent spilling) to the room cleaning service staff placing a small lid on top of a glass of water to prevent dust to the cashier in the casino thanking me for my military service to the pool attendant providing an extra towel for the chair to the valet calling us a cab and helping load our luggage to the beautifull immaculate room and view of the strip to the large bank of elevators whisking us from our floor to the ground to the clean casino with updated machines excellent service caring staff. Visited Bellagio and MGM and the crowds were rude and pushy machines dirty ashtrays everywhere overflowing...I was never so happy to return to the Mandalay Bay Casino where it feels safer and much cleaner. We will never stay at any other property in Las Vegas!
40,We brought a large group for graduation and the accommodations were perfect four our entire group. The beach and pools are perfect and lots of fun. Food was great at the pools and service was fast will return
20,The front desk told us Mandalay will text me but I never got any contact. It went way past my original check in time. We had to walk around with our luggages and be hungry because the restaurants didn't allow us to eat there without a reservation a day in advance.
50,Great place to stay and the rooms are awesome with spectacular views. The staff is very friendly and check-in was easy with mobile options. The atmosphere at this place is so wonderful that you don't have to leave this casino to have fun at your stay.
40,"The Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino is great!! Although it is at the far southern end of The Strip Mandalay Bay does great job of offering great amenities within the resort at great price points while still being a mid-level resort. Mandalay Bay is a mid-level resort so I'm in no way trying to compare them to high-level resorts like Aria Bellagio Venetian Wynn/Encore or the newly opening of Resorts World. High level resorts come with a higher price tag. Mandalay has great pools an awesome steakhouse and excellent nigh-life options. The room decor was great and the bed was very comfortable. If someone still wants to complain about the location I can't argue with that. If you really want to be in the center of all the ""action"" and foot traffic you might prefer something near Planet Hollywood. Because the two times that I walked The Strip I got down to the northern end near Mirage and Wynn and could not make the walk back so I had to take a cab. I was there for this past Memorial Weekend on an Mlife promotion. I highly recommend the Mandalay Bay if you are looking at a mid-range resort. I have been to Vegas many times before and because of COVID Vegas was not quite at 100% but I would say it was at about 75 - 80%. But the good news is that starting June 5th Vegas would be returning to 100%.  1. No mask mandate. Wear one if you want to. Although some shopping stores still might require you to still wear a mask. This particular trip hotel guests did not have to wear a mask inside the casinos but many stores did require one.  2. Shows Entertainers EDM DJs Hip-Hop artists all set to return starting June 5th."
40,We stay at Mandalay Bay twice a year (8 -12 day stay each time). The atmosphere is a little more laid back there and you are away from the usual large Vegas crowds. The casino is a little lacking in that the variety of table games offered is much more limited than most other casinos. There is a nice selection of restaurants available.
40,Really enjoyed the stay. The pools and water area are great. We really enjoyed the aquarium. It was fantastic. It is a little quieter than the hotels in the middle of the strip but we wanted that. It is nice that the Excaliber and Luxor connect but wish the moving walking belt was working.
50,I’ve stayed at most places on the strip over the years. I LOVED Mandalay Bay. The only negative is that it’s the last place on the strip. Utilize the Deuce and it’ll save you a lot of walking. Amenities are great pool are is second to none and the room I had was fantastic!
30,Water went out during our stay. Bathroom lights stopped working. We got VIP experience which is normally wonderful but this time it was terrible. The first driver that picked us up from the airport seemed annoyed that I stopped him as he was holding the tablet with our name on it. He was on the phone and seemed he didn’t want to be bothered or that we wouldn’t be The Who he was picking up. The weather was very hot and he insisted on closing the door to the car when the engine wasn’t on meaning no AC.    When we arrived to the hotel no one greeted us to take us straight to our room. Bellhop wasn’t there either. We had to walk to VIP desk to check in. The lady said someone was suppose to greet us along with bellhop.    Someone came to drop off our welcome letter and keys but no one took us to our room and again no bellhop. We just took our luggage to our room ourselves.    The VIP experience was something extra we paid extra for and have enjoyed it in the past. This time it fell short.    The manager gave us 50% credit of the price of the VIP experience
50,This was our third stay at Mandalay Bay. The facility is great the staff always provides great service and we had a great meal at StripSteak. The Ribeye was amazing. We cannot wait to get to Hussong's Cantina for the best Margaritas and Guacamole.
50,This was our first time staying at the Mandalay Bay resort and it compares a lot to the Bellagio which is also part of the MGM group. We decided to stay here because of their awesome pool called “The beach”. Definitively recommend this hotel to anyone especially if traveling with your family. Don’t forget to bring your own flotation devices to use in the lazy River as the hotel doesn’t provide those and they sell them for about $24 each.
10,"We stayed at Mandalay Bay for 5 days using MLIFE promotional. On our 4th morning with the ""DO NOT DISTURB"" sign on our room door-nob CARIDAD a lady housekeeper came into our room to tell us that we should have left. I told her that we were registered for 5 days -- until Saturday. Also we did NOT have any hot/cold water because pipes burst. Also the room key stopped working and it took over 1 hour to get help from the front desk from Security Guard and the locksmith."
30,Hotel was nice look expensive but when we got to the room the expected view was not met we had a view of the root also the shower did not have cold water luckily our room included a bathtub it was really uncomfortable to take a shower we call the front desk with regards to the problem and it was not solve at all during our three day stay. Did not include breakfast it was not inclusive like it said it was when I booked it. So we had to buy breakfast lunch and dinner which was expensive. Also there were a lot of people walking around drunk people were smoking inside the hotel and they were stoned.
10,The whole stay was horrible. The restaurants were closed and what was open were overpriced. The slots were absolutely horrible. The parking was ridiculous. I will never stay here again and don’t recommend this hotel
50,For being a memorial day wknd and having a UFC fight it was a pretty chill wknd. The staff are friendly and super helpful. There’s affordable food and the pool area is pretty big with bout 3-4 different pools. The lazy river is awesome! Had some issues with mobile room key (didn’t work at all) and my physical room keys kept getting deactivated and not wanting to work in the elevators but other than that its a great hotel!
50,Mandalay Bay is and will always be my Favorite in Vegas. For 28 years of Vegas visits.. The Bay never disappoints & will always be my 1st choice My Favorite Sky View Suite looking out the window at the Raider Stadium. Just perfection 😇
50,My favorite place to come relax no need to even leave the resort. The Beach is the best pool in Vegas. If you want to venture further down the strip the tram is there taxis are easy access. My favorite place to stay.
40,Our room was great even tho the shower did not appear to be clean (so we wore our flip flops).    The expensive part came in with the water park you cannot bring ANY “outside” food or beverage in the water park even if you purchased it inside the resort. The food prices were more than double what you would pay at any restaurant or fast food location.
30,Mandalay Bay needs to get it together from staff friendliness CLEAR and accurate communication and also fix their app. Had a sticky and dirty trash can and no liner from previous guest ridiculous hold times to speak to front desk. Overall I won't be coming back and it's a bummer because I really was expecting Mandalay Bay to be better than what it was.
50,Everything was on point and excellent service. I highly recommend staying there. Staff was very informative helpful and kind. Room was very comfy and clean. My home away from home I’ll be back real soon!
40,Brought 35 people to celebrate my daughters 21st birthday. Mandalas Bay had great facilities to host. Our suite was perfect size for two gatherings and when the hotel gets their post COVID feet under themselves I think they will again be one of best resorts on the strip.
20,The only great thing about this hotel is the pool area. Room needs updating iron broken guest services didn’t answer for an entire day dirty glasses left in hallway for days no washcloths rude pool waitresses guest WiFi not functioning petty charges for in room coffee (no you can’t even use the cups)....there are plenty of other places to stay.
20,For years I have heard that the Mandalay Bay resort was a five star hotel. I did not find that to be so. The rooms are spacious however our bed had a permanent indentation (sag) in it the shower was not clean and the toilet stool had stains. The ice machines on each floor were not working and the refrigerator was stocked with overpriced items so you couldn't keep your beverages cold. A very disappointing stay - did not meet my expectations.
50,I came here with my family. The rooms were very spacious and clean. We really enjoyed the wave pool and lazy river. We also enjoyed the aquarium. There are plenty restaurants and things to do. This place is great for families.
50,From the beginning we was greeted with a smile the service was amazing from all staff and the room was amazing and upscale the biggest bathrooms I ever seen with nice picture decorations. We got or money’s worth and more
20,This place is too big for hospitality. As a frequent traveler I am more than appalled at the overall experience. Lucas was kind at check-in but I almost had to argue him down that the resort king and the strip king were two different prices... he finally grabbed a manager to adjust. But the company didn’t even answer our calls the 3x we called the front desk. The lines were overwhelming and I felt like I just was helpless.  Pool was packed and I felt like the resources were scarce. We didn’t have a late night dinner place which I would’ve preferred to know before arrival. Subway was a long ways away with a wait of 30 mins not to mention the lackluster service.. Just over all feel like I paid for the name and that’s it. I will not recommend a stay to any of our friends. We didn’t enjoy our stay. Too many things to count that were wrong. The bell hop desk was a wait. Rick was in such a rush he listened to respond and on the other hand (had to reiterate my question multiple times) Bobby was courteous and had jokes. Our Maid was great on our first day she was kind when we interrupted her cleaning.
10,The hotel is nice but we switched rooms 3 times due to left over food chunks smeared on the tables and black fingerprints on the pillows could even touch the phone it was so dirty and the last room woke up to leftover make up from someone previous.and blood drops in the shower. Covid is coming to an end we all have to do our job clean the rooms when you go in there. That’s all just clean it
50,Had such a great experience. Customer service was great from arrival to departure. Definitely would love to stay at Mandaly Bay on my future visits to Las Vegas! Even tho it was Memorial Day weekend parking wasn't bad at all! Thanks again for a great experience
20,Sad to see such a nice place in the condition it was in. Litter broken amenities and just general run down are not words I ever thought I would use to describe Mandalay. Other resort guests were obnoxious. The pool was over run with kids and inattentive parents. We love meeting new people from all over the world but were disgusted with the behavior of several guests. We saw everything from regularly having someone without a key card trying to access guest floors to abhorrent treatment of resort staff. Your wonderful team of people shouldn't ever have to be treated the way they were by several guests when we were there. I grew up in a small resort town and we would never tolerate that.
10,No access to ice. Apparently every i e machine on every floor just stopped working for the entire 6 day stay. So M does not have the ability to fix ice machines for entire week.. at the pool the frozen drink machines are out of order. Several hour wait or never for room service. Water stopped working for several hours in the whole building. And yet they still demand full resort fee. How is that fair? Stay somewhere else.
40,I'm a local from Henderson NV and every summer I have been bringing my daughter and son for a day or two. The wave pool and the lazy river pools are fantastic.  Excellent customers services breakfast at the Seabreeze Caféwas delicious Especially the French toast and veggies omelet.
20,Tv did not work or have a remote . One of the sinks was plugged up . The toilet leaked from the back . I called guest services multiple times but nobody ever answered . Went for the pool and was nice .
10,Post- Covid is difficult but is it so difficult that the Mandalay Bay resort can't even keep the water running? Every aspect of this trip took an effort on my part even simple things like the fact that I had pre-paid for a car to pick me up via the mandalay VIP package ($150). The car didn't show up so I had to call and wait for it. I should have known the rest would be a struggle as well.    The lowest point was waking up to no water on our floor. When you turned on the shower it made a sucking noise. A trip to the front desk (after waiting on hold for an absurd amount of time) revealed that the water would only be out for an hour... Five hours later it came back on.    I'll be trying other resorts on future trips to Vegas.
30,Housekeeping was poor we had to call for someone to bring clean towels.  Limited to number of pools available. Should provide that info up front.  Tram was down the entire time we were there. Very poor service all around.
50,I love that I was able to alert the hotel of my estimated time of arrival through mgm app before I even arrived had an email saying my room was ready and I was at to check into my room at 9:30am instead of 3pm. (Was a Monday) Room was very nice loved the shower Great for tall people like myself. Elevator from rooms take you right down to the pool entrance was nice not to have to walk through entire casino to get to the pool area. Wave pool and lazy river were great. Really like the casino also. Shark Reef is great to walk through. Love the Rythem and Riffs Bar (Hopefully live music will return soon). Also took a short walk over to the Pinball Hall of Fame Museum across the street. Only bad thing was the tram was closed. Great experience will most likely stay there again especially during pool season.
20,Our bathroom wasn’t cleaned. It had used shampoo and soap in the shower and by the sink. They did come and clean out room when we reported it. I appreciate the $50 credit but we won’t go back.  On the positive the restaurants were amazing and the staff was courteous.
50,Was visiting with my mom for my birthday weekend and we had a very nice room. The weather wasn't great but it was still an enjoyable weekend. I love going to the shark reef and I love how nice the hotel is. Had a wonderful birthday thank you Mandalay Bay
30,"I've visited Las Vegas many times. I had never stayed at Mandalay Bay. I was very excited because the pictures looked great.  It is a beautiful property. My room was really nice. And the staff was very friendly. However there were many problems:  First off the TV didn't work. I tried twice guest services twice but each time was on hold for 10 minutes before I hung up because that is not how I wanted to spend my vacation.  Second one of the pillow cases had something crusty on it I found a sock that didn't belong to me and a hair tie by the bed that also did not belong to me which led me to question if anyone had cleaned the room.  I had specifically looked for a hotel with a bathtub. On the last night I drew a bath and was super excited to enjoy it. I noticed an odor but couldn't quite place it. At one point some water splashed into my eye and it burned so bad I had to get out of the tub. I then realized the smell was of bleach or ammonia.   There was also a noise issue. The second night something in the bathroom started making a gurgling sound occasionally. It was loud enough to wake me up twice in the night. And the first morning someone was banging on my door super early (I did have the do not disturb sign on) and wouldn't stop. I got up and it was some guy who had the wrong room.  In the middle of the second night some loud guests in the hallway woke me up and they were out there for quite a while making a lot of noise. While I understand that the hotel you not control what other guests do I have never had experiences like this in all my many trips to Vegas.  Finally on my last day I was killing time in the casino before going to the airport. My slot ticket went in a crack in the machine rather than the machine itself. I turned on my light and waited...and waited. After someone finally came to help (at least 15 minutes) the lady was very put out and reprimanded me for ""shoving: my ticket in."
40,Very good hotel. Clean pretty good amenities. Awesome convention center. Every single thing has a cost. I couldn’t believe that you had to pay for in room coffee. Come on! Also late night pool party made it impossible to sleep one night!
40,We’ve always enjoyed staying at the Mandalay however this time our room was small modest and furnishings disappointed that the restaurants weren’t open after nine but all in all we had an OK time. Hopefully when we return soon things will be more back to normal and so will Mandalay
40,Very good pool and general facilities. Everything was clean and well kept. My floors ice machine did not work for 4 days so I had to request via room service which took from 30 minutes to an hour. I did have an issue with my leg and security brought up a wheelchair at brought me down to where I needed to go to get to the doctor.
50,Located on the south end of The Strip it's a short ride on The Deuce bus to the heart of the Strip. It's also certainly walkable. Our room was big well appointed comfortable bedding friendly staff. My grandson enjoyed the wave pool. Pleasant stay.
50,It is one of the hotels with the highest quality in service the treatment is merely professional. being able to rest and have the gym pool and different types of food where one can choose diversity! .
50,We loved our stay The pools were awesome our room had a really nice view and it was really nice housekeeping was the best and really made our stay they were very friendly and held high standards I definitely would stay there again would would recommend
20,Just returned from four-day stay at the Delano Hotel. Had reserved a cabana at the Delano Beach pool which was fine. Also reserved the daybed at the Beach location at the Mandalay Bay wave pool. complete waste of $375. Absolutely no service. Had to ask for ice. Had to ask for somebody to at least come by and asked if we wanted a drink or something to eat once in a while. Was completely ignored until about 12 noon. Very uncomfortable daybed. This piece of advice we'll save you a lot of money. Renting to padded lounge chairs will be a lot more comfortable for you.
20,Our room had a really horrible odor which lingered on our clothing when we left. It really threw us off for the day. Also the tub had a slight flood and it saddened us because we really wanted to use it expensive room with bad quality. The staff was nice though.
30,Just stick to the regular rooms and enjoy pool and restaurants. Don't expect rooms to be ready and clean. They will try their best but will disappoint when you pay for the vip service and for the penthouse.
10,Go to another hotel!!!! Staff was rude didn’t want to do their job. My room stayed dirty all day had to call and get someone to come clean it and it still took them 30mins to arrive. The cable tv kept going out! No one answered my calls at the front desk. The drinky girls were rude to me fir no reason couldn’t even get a drink while gambling.( thought it was free) Air in the room wouldn’t get cold. The beds are not comfortable and can barely sleep two adults.
50,Everything was great....I would like to stay again and hopefully do. The pools are awesome very nice and a good selection. The lazy River was awesome and my kids loved it. The runner was also very nice and so were the PAD ladies.
40,The pool area was amazing and the staff was very professional. Would be a 5 if not for the smell of marijuana by our room all day and night. I’m sure next week when fully open so will to the bars and restaurants.
50,Had a great time staying at the MGM signature resort . Everything was cleaned very well. Staff was amazingly helpful .. checking in was as easy as pie .. can’t wait to return to this hotel. Great amenities provided
20,When one employee has an attitude problem it can be anything. When most of the staff is rude and obtuse then your management at the very top is the issue. So it is at the Mandalay Bay. Not friendly. No water this morning and they are far from proactive Avoid it.
50,The hotel was great. It has everything you need on their grounds. Enjoyed my vacation very much here. Would definitely recommend to anyone including families with small children the water park was huge and great for kids!
30,Came for my birthday. I've worked in the casino industry and am familiar with how people are treated based on money spent in the casino. I feel I spent a decent amount and received nothing in return. They tried to charge me mini bar fees because our kids had moved things around in their fridge (one of our kids is special needs). At least they removed those charges. Got better birthday treatment off property.
40,Knew what to expect with room coffee & bar fees - so brought own but still had unexplainable 'ghost' fees show up anyway. After calling customer service - fees removed - so check your account daily!! Re: mobile key card - phone can be slow to open app every time - especially using elevators - so you can make your own room keys from mobile app at counter in lobby - that worked better! Pool was not as crowded and it appeared to be open- without appointment in afternoons when water was warmer anyway. Still not all restaurants open - so we had deli meals and went to Luxor restaurant row - expect everything to be expensive everywhere!!!
40,Fun place and rooms are very comfortable. Make sure to have your room key card for pool or no entry. I forgot mine and has to make journey. Really big place  it’s a little farther from strip center like the bellagio but it’s worth the money
20,This has the look and feel as a resort and they even claim it in the Title. But the staff and their policies will leave you feeling like you booked at sub-par discount motel. They did not deliver on the room I reserved. This is first-come-first served. And they don't care about a commitment they make to late night arrivers. Get there early in the day if you want what you reserved. You cannot use the Fridge in the room because it is 100% full of their overpriced beverages. They do not have a microwave or a toaster in the room.
10,From the moment I checked in it was a mess. Room was dirty toilet seat was broken off sheets had makeup all over them and bed had no fitted sheet just a mattress pad and top sheet. I checked in the first night after midnight and was still charged a resort fee even though all the amenities were closed. Nothing close by to get food. Trams between the hotel weren’t working so you are trapped there unless you uber it. Also a homeless man followed me into the elevator and back to the 10th floor I was staying on. I told security and they said this happens all the time. They seemed to be able to describe the man to me. I felt really uncomfortable as a female. Never again. It has the modern day makings of the Cecil hotel. Don’t say I didn’t warn you
50,My family and I had a great and pleasant stay at this hotel. We ate at Citizens (A restaurant inside the casino) and had lots of fun at the beach. This is a great place to stay with kids! We truly recommend this place!
20,Last time for us to stay at the Mandalay Bay. Below average service many restaurants closed the open restaurants and other places were short staffed some kind of acidic cleaner was used in or around the hotel hallways that stunk and table minimums were high. Many gaming tables were closed. No thanks!
20,On a quick business visit to Las Vegas and stayed in the Mandalay Bay.  Check-in was efficient and pleasant.  Room was not well cleaned and was showing its age. Dust lamps that didn’t work taps that need maintenance and just looking tired and uncared for. In this time of COVID anything less than exemplary standard are unacceptable. There were food crumbs under the edges of the glass desk. To be fair the bed was fine.  Check out was efficient (at 6.30am) albeit rather mechanical.  To charge $20 for a bottle of water in the room really is pushing the limits of decency though we all know that in room food/drink is always expensive.  The overall environment was tired past it’s prime and trying to eek every cent it could from clients.  I didn’t try some of the resort features and that may have improved my view but overall this did not impress against so many options in the area.
20,Our room was rented to us with visible water damage. Our second room had mold in the shower and clogged plumbing. The cleaning staff was inattentive and obviously knew of the issues and ignored them. Both rooms were disgusting
10,Stayed in the 2 bedroom panoramic suite. Showed up to check in at 4:30 pm and our room wasn’t ready until 6:30. No wheelchairs or scooters were available for my handicapped mother in law so we had to pay the company directly to have one brought to the hotel the next day. Room service food is just plain terrible.
50,We stayed at the stay well rooms this trip and the beds were exceptionally superb!!!!!! Love the beach of course! It is amazing every time and the cabana is a must if you have a big family. Makes it so much luxurious and comfortable. Can’t wait to come back.
50,Travelled to Vegas with my young daughter: hotel is clean and staff was courteous and helpful. Like anything in Vegas everything is close but far away the hotel does have everything you might need close by while you are away from home
50,The best pool for family with young kids. Our young boys loved the wave pool and the lazy river was a nice change of pace. The hardest part was finding food for the kids with COVID restrictions. We will be back for sure
50,We had such a great time. Hotel room was so clean housekeeping was always there for anything we needed. Pool was great. Lots of chairs available. Food was awesome. We ate at a couple of the restaurants on site.
50,My kids and i loved the beach and lazy river i enjoyed seeing my kids play and have fun we liked the bathtub it was so comfortable and i love the richness look of the place staff was nice someone even opened the door for me and held it open its so busy but the people keep moving and i loved our view out the window
40,We stay here because it is clean and has great food options. The tram is very convenient as well. Comfortable beds and pillows are a plus. Staff is always friendly and professional. We us the MGM app for checking in and the digital room key built into the app.
50,"Tara Mcadorey consistently goes above and beyond as my casino host. She is responsive and thoughtful in her responsiveness. She has mastered the art of ""person-centered or guest-centered"" services. Outstanding Host!"
20,I make an effort in assisting the lobby lines by utilizing the mobile app checkin feature. I get punished every time for checking in via the app by getting the worst room low floors “SO MY RECOMMENDATION” check in via a real person at the lobby for best results.    I have severe allergies so my shock that they were not worried about the dust. The dust accumulated by house keeping or last guest leaving the vent window open. See pictures.    Room is spacious and I bet they do have nice rooms.  I waited 30 min 45min finally gave up and just took a zertek.    No assistance from guest services operator or front desk. If this how mgm treats gold members and mgm credit card holders then maybe I need to stop giving these resorts a chance and continue staying at non MGM properties for good experiences and customer service.    I would say review your options and if service matter skip MGM properties.    Broken shower 🚿  Dirty pillows  Dust  Poor customer service  Teri reward not worth the hassle
30,The hotel is way overpriced for what it is. At one time this was a premier property. Unfortunately those days are gone. The resort is in dire need of regular maintenance. It has not been maintained properly over time. Do not be fooled by the beach and various pools. If your staying on site it is not worth it.    All of the restaurants and retail stores are grossly overpriced. $25 for a basic breakfast cannot be justified. And the mark up on room service is offensive.  My door lock was broken bathroom door handle was hanging the tv hdmi port was not functional the sink was clogged and staff was unsympathetic.    This is not a property that is kid friendly.    Save your money and do NOT stay here.
50,Getting checked in through the mobile and receiving some amazing service to get situated was a great start to an amazing weekend. Trina was so helpful in getting our room close to our daughter’s friends room. I can not wait to come back when Vegas is 100% open to enjoy the casino and restaurants/ bars even more. We will be back!
50,Mandalay is the best. From customer service and beautiful rooms you can’t go wrong staying there. Front desk is friendly housekeeping is pleasant. The restaurants are great as well. A lot to choose from.
20,The pool is several small pools not a big one like advertised. Couldn’t find poker or bar inside pools. Casino had Hardly anything open to do. And a maid tried to enter room at 9am woke us up from sleeping. No free cocktails on casino floors. Sucked....
30,The room & pool were great. The ice machine never worked on our floor & you cannot access any other floors with your room key. Be prepared to spend a LOT on food & drinks and if you want to use the fridge its $50.
20,They TV in our room didn't work. One of the faucets (cold water) in our bathroom didn't work and we had to stand in line for about an hour each morning to get coffee at the Starbucks downstairs when there were at least two other Starbucks stands we saw that they kept closed each day.
50,Me and my two friends enjoyed the lifeguards very much. The lifeguards were extremely nice(to look at) especially the blonde boy. The wave pool was mostly relaxing except for when people ran me over with their tubes. I was hoping a lifeguard would come save me but... didn’t happen.
10,Stayed at Mandalay Bay for my daughter's volleyball tournament. This tournament requires the players to play as early as 8am. Mandalay Bay schedule a concert that played until 11pm preventing our athletes with rooms facing the pool from getting any sleep until after 11pm. Not only was it poor planning on the hotels part but they failed to let guest know about the concert at check-in.
20,noisy rooms no dampening of noisy from other rooms hallway or pool  Charge occurs when objects are moved - no obvious signs stating that  unable to use refrigerator for cooling drinks  no basic toiletries such as q-tips cotton balls hair net
10,My hotel is supposed to be free because of my m rewards. But when i got to the hotel they charged me $100 for deposits and charged me again for mini bars that I didn’t drink. Will never stay here again
30,The casino is way to busy and Starbucks closes at 4pm which is pointless. That was the worse part they also had a band playing at night that vibrated everyone’s rooms. Me and my two sisters and there families were staying in different rooms on different sides and both complained of the vibration.
10,We had no running water and the club music was too loud to sleep with. For all that inconvenience we only got $40 compensation. If thats what Mandalay considers acceptable I wouldn’t recommend anyone to stay here.
20,The beds were not clean. We discovered this at 10:00 pm. Took an hour to get them changed. They charge if you OPEN the mini fridge. They charge for the in room coffee. Figi water is $20 in the room. Dumb things to get cheap over when it’s $250 per night.
50,Came for volleyball and had a great time. Check in was easy as well as check out. No problems. Will definitely come back and bring family. Rooms were clean and well stocked staff were friendly and helpful.
50,Hotel overall is still a great property ... it’s upscale but not pretentious ... room was spacious and very comfortable ... family and friends enjoyed the pool and lazy river ... staff was great ... we will stay again
50,We had the very best time! Very clean room comfortable bed and excellent time at the pool. Everyone of the staff members was very helpful with a smile. Loved the poolside food and bar service. Great time!
40,My overall stay here was very good. Except for one of the sinks backing up and for having a small number of blackjack tables the stay was fine. Mandalay Bay is a great property just as most of the MGM properties are.
50,"If you're heading to Las Vegas make it a point to stay at Mandalay Bay. You'll find friendly courteous staff to assist you with all of your needs. The rooms are comfortable and roomy. You'll have a great choice in restaurants from grab and go to ""that someplace special"". If you're a gambler plety of slot and table games to choose from. We've been there several times and never been disappointed."
30,Great room overall was clean and spacious. Had a problem with getting charged for an extra bed but they never provided it. Unfortunately i had to sleep on the floor because the extra rollout bed was never provided
10,Was told during reservation process that all pools were included with the $45 resort fee that was a lie.    Recommend going elsewhere for the pool scene you’ll still pay $ but at least you won’t be misled.
50,I love you all for your hard work...  The room was amazing. The bath tub was awesome. I love it...didn't wanna leave. We will return we do live here in Vegas but love to get out and bout to have a great time...
20,The experience of being in vegas is always fun and you should always expect to spend a lot on overpriced food and drinks. That is not the issue. What I do have an issue with is the room. While yes it was clean and turn down service was fine I have a real problem with not having any coffee available in my room for free. Using their precious coffee that was available will cost you in excess of $10. This must be some kind of magic coffee. How is it that when I go on a business trip any hotel I stay at provides a coffee machine and coffee in my room for free and Mandalay Bay can't? Then I have to walk down to the casino floor and find only one place available that has coffee for $10 a cup! Ridiculous. Then the water in the shower was too hot. In room beverages are overpriced. $20 for a bottle of Fiji Water please. If you use the in room refrigerator and rearrange their precious overpriced in room beverages you will incur a charge to your room. I don't know if I will ever stay at Mandalay Bay ever again. These things to me are unacceptable. I get it its the Las Vegas Strip but some things should be changed. At the very least get the coffee thing fixed. How is it a Hampton Inn or a Holiday Inn can provide free in room coffee and a mega-resort like you can't? Unacceptable.
10,Multiple threw ups in the hallway outside of the guestrooms. Called guest services several times. No one came to clean up the mess. People walking through it since they didn't see them. Very disappointed especially during the covid-19 time.
50,decided to stay at this hotel due to the family friendly pools. price was great due to booking before vegas really opened up. friendly staff and excellent pool view from my room. room was very spacious with large bathroom that had his and her sinks separate toilet and a separate bathtub and standup shower. already booked and returning in august when my son goes back to college.
40,Prices have significantly increased for virtually everything except the room which is still a value. Table games are regularly $25 minimums. The pools are still fabulous rooms are well maintained and the property remains beautiful.
50,We loved our stay. Hotel was huge and lots of stuff to see and do. Hotel staff and house keeping were very friendly and always helped us when needed. The room we had was nice. We had a decent view of the stadium.
40,Overall OK. I did not like how I paid for for an Executive Suite but the Executive Suite was on the 5th floor (facing a concrete parking structure). It should have been higher up - at least the 20th floor. I felt ripped-off.
40,Had a good time here at Mandalay Bay. The pools were awesome and cabana service was great. Had some issues with the key cards not working multiple times throughout the trip. The slot machines were extremely tight and I didn’t see anyone winning any jackpots the entire duration of my trip. If you plan to utilize the pools for the day I recommend renting a cabana. The food and drink prices at the pool though are extremely high. You can bring in your own food but they don’t allow you to bring alcohol. Lazy river was nice but packed. You can bring your own donut style float to save $25 a day. Floats come with the cabana if you rent one. I would definitely stay there again for the pool experience however I would find somewhere else to gamble.
40,This is an amazing hotel. The pools and casino are very entertaining. My room was clean and my bed was comfortable.This hotel connects to 2 other casino's ( luxor and Excalibur) which allows you yo walk inside on hot days.
30,The property is in need of maintenance and cleaning. Rooms were ok but seemed tired staff did not seem to be happy to be at work- they were not rude but not friendly. Security is lax- we were woke up on two different nights by drunks fighting in the hallway. If you stay here you need to enjoy the smell of marijuana smoke as it is everywhere. There are better properties that are in better shape and do not allow shenanigans to occur elsewhere on the strip. Will not stay here ever again
50,Check in was a breeze. Had our room ready early. Staff were friendly. Room was clean and very spacious. Cocktail waitress was super friendly and remembered our order every time. Ladies at the M Life desk were helpful and friendly.
40,The casino and hotel was overall a good experience. The facility was expected although there was nothing that wowed me during my stay. Perhaps it is just because things are starting to reopen. Most restaurants were open at least on a limited basis. There was nothing bad or unexpected just didn’t get that Las Vegas wow factor.
30,Charged for items in room not used. Charged higher price at shops for products than on tag. Pay for lounge chairs and umbrellas close to the wave pool - $75 each per day. Many venues closed or limited hours. Prices in restaurants increased significantly since the pandemic.
10,I have been coming to Mandalay Bay for over 20 years and have never stayed anywhere else. As I am setting up my upcoming visit I have begun to realize that my loyalty to the hotel has not been reciprocated. I have made numerous requests to many different individuals and have not received ANY sort of return communication. This is very disappointing to me because in the past the hotel has always been so helpful.    I love this hotel and everything it offers but the lack of loyalty will force me to look into other options.
50,Suite room with Strip view was very spacious and comfortable. Mandalay staff are very friendly and provide top-notch service. Sea breeze Cafe provided great breakfasts and friendly service. Digital check-in was easy. You’ll enjoy your stay!
50,The hotel was beautiful! We stayed in 17-333 and overlooked the pool. The room was beautiful. The hotel interior design is really great. The room has floor to ceiling windows and doors a nice bathtub and separate shower. The hotel lobby and even casino smell really nice too - they must have great ventilation. The pool was great - warm water relaxing wave pool and lazy river and real sand by the chairs. I was traveling with my two teen daughters and felt safe with them the whole time - the location of the hotel at the very end of the strip gave it a different feel than a lot of the other hotels. There were tons of families too so the girls didn't feel objectified like they did in other parts of Vegas. I give it 100%.
50,Amazing pool area. Wave pool regular pools lazy river. Quieter and more laid back then many strip properties. Really good dining. Brisket bowl at BBQ Mexicano was beyond good. Only down side was the waiter at Libertine made us feel like we didn't belong there. We are a younger couple who was dressed casual. We could've been misreading the vibe he was giving off but I don't believe so. If he had known we are millionaires who generally tip excessively perhaps he would've been kinder. But he shouldn't have to know that to provide good service. Regardless of that overall our stay at Mandalay Bay was phenomenal.
50,My husband and I stayed here twice before and this is our third time after having a kid. He is 3 and a half. We knew from our previous two stays that when we have a kid will make sure to stay here because it is very family friendly. We stayed for 3 days. We wanted our son to enjoy the pools specially the easy river.  First I was disappointed that my son is too short to get in the big pool with the waves. However I didn’t know that they have a small pool for kids on the side of the wave pool and the way it was designed allowed part of the wave to enter the small pool which added so much fun to the kids there. My son had a blast. They had a lifeguard standing there the whole time to make sure kids don’t cross over to the big section. Very smart design.  The lazy river was fun as usual.  Thank GOD we arrived there after mid May because the rules were more relaxed. Reading previous reviews about wearing the masks at the pool area made me not want to go. But now they posted in few hotels signs saying “ if you are fully vaccinated you don’t have to wear the mask. If you are not you have to wear it”  No one was there to check who is vaccinated or not. Basically it was left up to people and their comfort level.  All employees were wearing masks. Some stores and restaurants required wearing masks to enter others didn’t.  Property is very clean and big with so much to offer.  Parking was still free when we were there. But I think starting June 1st Hotels will go back to charing for parking.  Rooms where clean and comfortable. Very good customer service.  I would definitely come back and recommend this hotel to others.
10,Lots of failures upon arrival with no service recovery. Bellhop failure. Bellhop management failure. Front desk failure. Front desk management failure. Bellhop failure again. There are no words to adequately describe this experience.
50,Great place to stay. All staff members friendly and helpful. Great dinner at Citizens. The beach and pools the best by far. The Border grill was also very good. Room was clean and well stocked and the maid service was top notched. I would definitely recommend this hotel and casino.
20,not clean broken fixtures. was told to wait for the room to get clean. Note this is after 4 pm check in. Then the room was dirty! This is the Media room penthouse. that did not even work. WOW! WILL NOT BE GOING BACK
50,From the moment we drove up we were greeted with nothing but smiles and helpful staff! The outdoor landscape is stunning! My wheelchair accessible room was 58 floors up with a view straight through the strip! The beds are sooo comfy and the room was extremely clean and didn't smell like pot!
50,This is an exceptional resort to stay at. Especially if you are willing to go the extra mile to feed yourself and another. Wasn't quite ready for the food prices but hey it is Vegas. Probably one of the best pools on the strip. I would definitely go back... Just a little better prepared next time.
30,If you are coming to gamble as we were you are going to spend a lot of time going to other casinos. Poker room was completely closed. The closest operating poker room is MGM Grand and it was closed Tuesday and Wednesday! Weekdays unless you want to play blackjack craps or roulette you might be out of luck. Some of this is due to the labor crunch but there are other strip operators that are running at full capacity.  Room was great. Food was above average. Pool was great. Location at the end of the strip is sub-par -- not normally an issue if you can do everything on the south end but a major hassle when you have to hoof it 30 minutes or take a cab to Aria or Caesars.
40,Housekeeping is terrible skipped my room twice out of the 4 nights I was there... without me putting up the sign saying to skip service. Room service is slow.. waited one hour for just coffee and a parfait. Bring your own toothbrush/toothpaste body wash and bubble bath they don’t provide that.
10,Never again. Gave me a room that wasn’t even clean. House keeping came in to clean the bathroom after I was already checked in and also it was old food left in the fridge from the person that stayed their before me. Room 60128
10,If you want to eat do not do so in the Mandalay Bay we paid $45 for two quesadillas in a second rate Mexican restaurant. They also charge you for coffee in the room. Find somewhere other than the Mandalay Bay if you want to have any money to gamble and not spend it all on food.
30,When I went to Mandalay shops the sales lady’s on the store at 2am on may 19 they was very bad people don’t deserve that job at all. The next time I’ll have to buy outside and bring my stuff in because of their bad actitudes
50,New mattresses filtration in room on Heath floors was great surprise. The opening after restrictions were lifted was excellent. The beach and casino were back to normal with health concerns being taken care of everywhere
30,My Mlife card with the military discount was not honored at this hotel and its restaurants. The room was great; however the room service and housekeeping was not. Room service overcharged me and housekeeping provided me with insufficient supply of towels. My first time at Mandalay Bay and I expected much more. The price was cheaper and more I see why.
50,This was my first time staying in one of thier free comp rooms. Better than bellagio's free comp room. Will definitely stay again the the future. This is part of my top 5 hotels on the strip. So far stayed at Vdara Venetian cosmopolitan Aria
50,easy to check in with app. pool was amazing. restaurants were excellent. this was a nice staycation for our 12th wedding anniversary. my wife and I liked the lazy river and wave pool the best. We would come back in a heart beat.
30,I walked in expecting far more for what I paid. I can’t use the coffee machine because I have to pay to use it. Can’t open the fridge cause it’s locked until I pay for it. Can’t even store my stuff in the fridge because they charge you for using it. That’s kind of a big deal. A place being so cheap that they charge for stuff like that? That’s pathetic. I will not be returning.    Also my “strip view” is of the airport not facing the strip.    I had super high hopes for this hotel because it’s a pretty high scale place and is expensive. But that was really what set me off.    I stayed at the JW Marriott in Boston and not only did they give me plenty of free coffee and water they also found out it was my birthday and gave me a bottle of wine and cake for free. That’s service.    Years ago I stayed at the Westgate in Vegas and I also got free water and coffee there and it was much cheaper.    I told mandalay bay I was celebrating my moms birthday and they didn’t care lol. I’m not expecting upgrades or anything but free water and coffee is a necessity for the price I’m paying.    The pool is beautiful but you have to rent any type of good chair with an umbrella. No shade anywhere. People burning. No free umbrellas. Renting tents starts at $250 that’s theft. Horrible.
30,Courts were unsafe - normal sports centers now have boundary nets to keep balls out of adjoining courts. Dangerous for players not to mention annoying with balls stopping games and momentum. We will not use this hotel again even if it is close to the convention center. Definitely not a family oriented hotel
50,Why travel farther down the strip when the best one is on the end of the strip! Get off plane and start playing in less than 10 minutes. M- life treats you like a king! Great rooms great pools great casino and great staff!
10,Me and my family have stayed at the Mandalay Bay many times we had always enjoyed our stay until this last weekend. We stayed in Media Suite 21-001 where do I start? first... the room was not ready until 6 pm 3hrs later that check in time when we finally got our room it was awful the room smelled so bad like someone vomit on the carpet and they did not care to wash it I called the front desk and all they could say was sorry they would send someone with deodorizer the try and cover the smell that the hotel was sold out and that I could not get another room. I had rented the media suite to celebrate my 13 yr old son's birthday I had guest over and had to wait another hour for housekeeping crew to come and spread some deodorizer on the carpet. At this point I was crying the party was already 4 hours late I had my son in another room waiting until they finished covering the smell. After they left we went ahead with our celebration since it was a kids party it ended early was I glad about that! By 4 am the smell woke us up it was unbearable  the deodorizer was gone but not the smell I was not moved to another room at 12 noon. It really saddens me to write this review I seems like they sold out even the rooms that they know they should not rent. The smell was not something we could just fabreze - it and it would go away. They don't care about their guests :( we will have to look for another home away from home in Vegas
40,Little pricey for the shark tank and no Vallet option but the customer service pool restaurants and cleanliness is worth coming. Many restaurant choices except a couple we wanted to go to are closed
50,Got the room complimentary with MyVEGAS and had a great experience. The room was clean and nice and the app made checking in super easy. Is a bit of a walk to most places but the tram helps a lot with that. I would stay again!
50,Great choice for a small family trip during a pandemic. Mandalay Bay gets ten stars for their cleanliness and professionalism.    Everyone on staff was very nice and security was also very helpful too. No complaints. Great customer service.    The views from the 26 floor was amazing! Loved the hot tub and maid service too!    The pool was even better. The lifeguards were on point with their job and made sure everyone especially the kids were playing safe and having fun.    Everyone at the hotel including the staff and guests wore their masks which made me love this experience even more.    The casino was fun too! I was looking forward to playing at a poker table or tournament but it’s understandable that they didn’t have one. We still did good with just blackjack roulette and slots machines. :)    The casino also had amazing air purifiers because I couldn’t even smell any smoke when we walked through the casinos. This is good for everybody especially for the kids.    Mandalay Bay made us all feel very welcomed and comfortable.    We all had a great time! We will Definitely be back again!
50,I honestly have to say that the Mandalay Bay is by far my favorite hotel in LasVegas. Nothing comes close to top notch services and entertainment when it comes to games and fun nothing comes close. If you come to Vegas this is the place to stay
30,We stayed at Mandalay Bay because we were offered a 2 bedroom panoramic suite. We could have stayed at any Mlife property comped but this was the nicest room. We checked in on the app at 2:00. At 4 we went to the desk to see if they knew when the room would be ready and they said it shouldn’t be long. The app would let us know. At 6 we were tired and talked to someone else. He informed us they were short on help and offered another room but we wanted the suite so he said we could have a free dinner. We ate at House of Blues and the food was just ok. At 9 we still hadn’t received our room and we were ready to take anything. We were the only ones at the desk and they finally gave us our room number. The room was nice but it wasn’t that special. Our view was the stadium. The casino and restaurants are very average. We will not stay here again.
40,Was in Vegas for a birthday celebration. Haven't stayed at the Mandalay Bay hotel for a few years. Room hasn't changed much. They need to update or renovate their bathroom/shower. Wifi is terrible. I had to contact hotel/IT help desk to resolve issue. Wifi is bad through the hotel as well. It was busy in Vegas! Pandemic is over. Casino need to open up more 3:2 blackjack table games. Try to get coffee from the outlets in the morning 30 min wait in line. Pool was great. Get there early. Go eat at the Border Grill for their all you can eat Sunday Brunch. Awesome food. Overall nice trip.
20,The hotel is gorgeous but the rooms are poorly cleaned. Dirty tubs. Hard as hell beds. I even had to request new blankets because the original ones had questionable stains. Staff was very nice about everything.
50,I love Mandalay Bay. My VIP host always makes sure I enjoy my trip. I was picked up at airport by a limo. Check-in is always easy and my One Bedroom Sky View Penthouse Suite was fantastic. Also had VIP Lounge access. A very neat place to relax on 62nd floor. The whole experience was fantastic. Can't wait to go back next month.
50,Steve did perfect as a face of the company. Definitely a model employee and great person. Overall the casino was very nice and the rooms were inviting. 10/10 recommend and to my guy Steve thank you!
50,King room with views of the strip are very spacious and beds are very comfortable. The choices of sand wave pool lazy river and regular pool are what brings me back to this lovely hotel. The Border Grill and House of Blues are excellent choices for food on site. No live music during my stay at the lounge bar in casino but typically a fav landing spot in the evening as well as the Foundation bar atop the hotel for outstanding views of the strip.
20,Mandalay Bay and its pools are one of the best. However if you have any issues with your M-Life status they will just tell you to visit someone else and you'll end up full circle again. M-Life is 100% pointless with the M-Life credit card.
50,Everytime I go to Vegas I want to have fun. And this trip I had was no exception. I loved the staff and everyone else for their hardworking nature during this pandemic. The sleep portion of the review is obvious for the times I did go to sleep/bed I was able to sleep very well. Even with the lights of the strip flashing the trip was perfect.
50,I actually took the bus from the airport to the hotel. Clean bus and the bus stop was directly outside of the hotel. The food was excellent. Adequate restrooms in the conference center. The room was very comfortable. I liked using my phone as the room key. Only issue- patience and persistence is required. It took up to 11 tries to unlock the door.
50,Great restaurants and many choices for entertainment including pools and a lazy river. Conveniently located to airports. Direct access to the Manadaly Bay Convention Center which was what we needed.    It was very windy and we could hear the wind. If you are a light sleeper you’ll hear it. For us the halls were quiet and couldn’t really ever hear our neighbors. The hotel was full due to a volleyball tournament as well as week get aways.
50,The staff are very friendly and help you with anything you need. The room are amazing the pool is magnificent. As well as the casino inside of the hotel. The restaurants have amazing options as well as bars.
50,Stayed at Mandalay Bay and it did not disappoint. All the staff were friendly and assisted with any questions. We had a cabana at the pool and enjoyed the wave pool and lazy river. Vegas is not requiring guests where masks indoors if your vaccinated but it seems no one was checking. The live music at the Rythms & Riffs bar was excellent. Our group had an all around great time. Seems only a few shops & restaanta had short hours or not fully open yet but still plenty to choose from
50,Probably one of the best stays I’ve had in vegas. I had 2 separate reservations and when I got there they were able to just combine the 2 and make it that much easier. Room was very clean food was great
30,Water leaking from pipes. Had to move rooms. Very inconvenient and took time from my family. The staff was friendly and the food was good. If it wasn't for the room issue the overall trip would have been great.
50,Everything went smoothly and we didn't have any issues. We used the pool and played the games. We used the app to check in and out so it was supper easy. We will be staying there again in out next short trip.
30,I don’t think I will stay there again. Not enough help and QR code’s doesn’t work always and same with the electronic key cards. Room wasn’t detailed there were soda stains and sticky remote control. Don’t think we will be returning.
20,Can’t even begin to explain how disappointed I am with the fact that I spent my 30th birthday here for my first trip to Las Vegas and spent well over $5000 exclusively at this resort just to be met with bottom of the barrel amenities and hostage tactics when it comes to services
50,Everything was great from the start of the trip to the end of the trip. We had a great time. The pool party was a blast. Drinks food and service was great. The room had great view of the pools and mountains.
30,Had an amazing dinner at Libertine before going to Luxor to see Carrot Top. Then went back to see the band in the lounge bar. Blue String Theory was playing and we’re amazing. Despite there being open seats the hostess put us on the waiting list. Twenty minutes later a group invited us to join at their high top. When our name came up another 20 minutes later I told the hostess we didn’t need our table we were happy to stay with our new friends. She was rude and angry but didn’t spoil our evening. We rocked until 1 am
30,We stayed at Mandalay Bay the April 23rd through the 29th. It was absolutely amazing the hotel was beautiful clean and staff was accommodating. The worst part was at the pool they had a multitude of staff that would come around every 5 minutes to ask people to put their mask on while sunbathing outside. Literally every 5 minutes it completely ruined our experience. I completely understand wearing masks while inside but while you're outside trying to sunbathe was absolutely a nonsensical. We were there to celebrate our birthdays and relax but they had at least 20 people going incessantly telling people to put their masks on....again we were outside. These weren't just friendly reminders this was relentless harassment . They stayed in the rule was You didn't have to have your mask on while actively eating drinking or smoking but even then they still came around to give you these reminders it got so bad that guests started to revolt it completely ruined our vacation. With that said gambling was great the House of Blues had amazing food and the boutique had amazing deals.
50,If you're looking for a place to travel with your family to relax or just a getaway this is the best place! The pools have everything you'll need! It's a really nice hotel. The room was amazing and the view exceptional.
20,Not enough dealers tables that were open were full. Not enough tables for the average player $5 to $10 a hand only $15 or $25 and up we're available. I play cards and roulette when I gamble and will bring $1000 to $2000 each time I travel. I don't consider myself anything other than a low end player but when there are no tables available at the hotel you are staying at you have to go to other casinos that is disappointing.
50,A quiet and secluded one of a kind place to visit or stay. Spacious and clean rooms. Casino not cluttered the atmosphere and energy there happy blissful. Weather warm air quality good . Water pressure good . Food and beverages plentiful public restrooms clean no toilet paper shortages. Sports book roomy and a must see. Art decoration one of a kind and beautiful . Music range just perfect . And the rest of Vegas has new buildings where older ones once stood.
50,Got their a little early but Javier front desk helped us out. Very professional and Excellent Customer Service . He helped us with very quick service.  Definitely will stay at Mandaley Bay Resort again . Thank you
50,Very cleaning sanitized. Practiced social distancing very well even on the casino floor. Rooms were maintained every day. Pool was phenomenal!!!! Great places to find shade if needed. Very helpful staff at the pool.
50,Great hotel that’s very clean. Nice family friendly activities. Though a lot of things aren’t open due to covid my family had a wonderful time. We will definitely be staying at this hotel again. Also a convenient little store as well with personal items
50,Brandy S. Castenada  Hotel Operations Manager  Here is why you are receiving this recognition. I was so impressed with the lengths you went through checking things as requested and expeditiously right on schedule such job performance and professionalism quality of service had to be recognized. This is an unsolicited review to show my appreciation for what Brandy has done in assisting and executing my request above and beyond and for that thank you. So to all you Travelers Mandalay Bay Casino is where you should choose to stay for any day of the year.
50,We came to play in the pool and on the slots and were not disappointed! We enjoyed the lazy river along with the wave pool and lagoons. We were always able to play our favorite machines. It was a win!
40,"We were in vegas May 13 - 16. Vegas dropped some of their mask rules this weekend. When we arrived Thursday about 95% of guests were in masks. By the time we left on Sunday it was down to about 20% of guests in masks. It was an interesting thing to witness & be a part of. No masks needed at the pool. They made us have one on Thursday but by Friday they no longer cared. Previous posts have talked about needing to line up early to get in the pool. That is no longer necessary. You shouldn't have a wait at the pool now. I think it's back to 100% capacity. One thing I always forget about vegas these days is that they hold a deposit for ""incidentals"". Ours was $300 which was a large chunk of our food budget for the weekend. We discovered that you can charge things against your room that will just deduct from that $300 deposit we made. We charged drinks & lunch at the pool dinner at Lupo & some pretzel bites in the mall. It's my understanding that you can charge to your room from any of the mgm properties & restaurants. So there's a hot tip!"
50,The pool/ beach/ lazy river are beautiful. The hotel is very clean and building is just beautiful. Staff is nice. It’s pricy but you can get a good through Priceline. It’s a nice place to for family fun.
10,been coming 20 years. security is horrendous. people jumping in elevators with no key to go to a party. yelling and typical rude party behaviour turned into riot with screaming girls and fighting with cops . Not what you want with a family. Definately dont recommend.
20,"The pools are still amazing and were the reason for staying at this property-but there were charges for everything! The only way to get an umbrella at the pool is to pay to rent one! You also have to pay for the ""provided"" in-room coffee- $10.00 for a 2-cup package without even real cream!"
40,It is a little too far down on the strip. Rooms are clean. Staff friendly. The resort fee is too high. Asked for a late checkout which should not have been a problem since hotel was no where near at capacity.
40,Pool area is great. Went during the week and pool was easily accessible. The 24hr Subway restaurant is helpful. Wish the Tram to Excalibur had been running during the week I am guessing it will when things get busier.
10,Just arrived last night. Will try for a more comprehensive review later. But for now folks should be aware that there are boatloads of maskless people in the casino hotel lobby and on the elevators. I am hoping that they are all vaccinated but am skeptical. Lots of pressure on these hotels but am wondering if designating elevators as public transportation and requiring masks might be a good way to go. That is of course if they aren't going to require proof of vax to go maskless in general.
30,This is okay hotel but would not be my hotel choice again while traveling to Vegas. Rooms were very nice be careful though there’s a mini bar in each room and very pricey as well. Hotel is kid friendly and they have a great housekeeping staff.
50,Generally an excellent stay in the King Suite. Experienced trouble checking in and a bit of unsatisfactory service but the overall trip was worth the drive out alone.    The only things missing from the room was a refrigerator and balcony but you can't win them all. The slot machines more than made up for the initial discomfort.
50,Our stay was great last minute trip and glad we choose Mandalay Bay great customer service I stayed at a few different hotels and we will return here again plenty to do for the kids and adults also next time we will stay longer
50,Mandalay is a VERY nice hotel to stay at. The only downside of staying here is how far away from the strip it is. It’s at the start of the strip so you will need to do a bit of walking to get there. The hotel rooms were clean and the cleaning ladies made sure to clean it up everyday which was amazing! The only problem in our hotel room was the handle on the sink. It was broken. Other than that our stay was 10/10
30,Mandalay Bay beach and pool facility was awesome. Overall hotel service cleanliness et cetera fine. It was not quite what we were expecting. This was not our best Las Vegas stay but still worthwhile.
50,Brought the kids along this time and they LOVED it. Everything from the beach to the eloquent rooms. We'll definitely be coming back (mom and dad trip next time). Staff was very helpful and kind. 10 out of 10 experience
50,Had a great 2 night stay...front desk was very accommodating. Great food at Citizens fun and interactive slot machine games. Will be back for sure. My favorite property to stay at when I visit Las Vegas!
50,Great Hotel for Fun.  Rooms are nice and clean.  Pool and beach area are very nice and enjoyable for all young and older.  Drink service is great and fast when playing slots.  Bars are good to hang out and had great bands at night.  over all service was great.  Cafe's and Restaurants Are all Good.
50,I really enjoyed my stay at the Mandalay. I like how clean it was. Staff was friendly and helpful. Absolute beautiful from the inside to the outside. Very comfortable beds. I appreciate everything. It was great.
50,I have a good stay. We had housekeeping everyday the hotel was beautiful and the room was really nice and clean. My only complaint is they didn't have a microwave. I think the hotel was in a good location.
20,My room was ready pretty early which was a good start. After that it was a major dissappointment. I have stayed at Mandalay Bay dozens of times. This time was awful. The bathtub would not stop dripping. For the few hours of sleep I wanted I listened to it all night. The light in the closets kept turning on and light was streaming into the room. The pool required a wait list and reservation.
10,My mom and I booked a penthouse suite for our annual 6-night Mother’s Day getaway. Unfortunately we didn’t know that the penthouse suites at this hotel are frequently used for large noisy late-night raves. For three nights straight we’ve dealt with loud music crowds loitering in the hallway and the heavy smell of cannabis. Each time we’ve called the front desk attendants were slow to respond and security guards didn’t show up for over half-an-hour.    On the first night my 78-year old mother had an asthma flare-up due to the lingering smoke and haze seeping into our room. Then there was a violent brawl in the hallway between a group of drunk teenagers and the Mandalay staff. Now the hotel is offering a small fee waiver for our rollaway bed - an inadequate gesture that does nothing to address the degree of trauma and discomfort we’ve endured. It’s a shame that this hotel can’t even manage its guests at a reduced capacity. Must be even worse when it’s full.
50,I went to Las Vegas and stayed at Mandalay Bay to celebrate my girlfriends birthday and enjoy this beautiful casino and all the fine dining that it has to offer. I have stayed at other MGM resort properties but I really enjoy staying at Mandalay Bay.
20,This hotel needs a big tuneup on customer service  They treat guests like cuddles  It takes more than 15 minutes if you call guest services from the hotel phone so if you need some thing do yourself a favor and go down to the reception as it would be faster than getting someone on the phone.  Rooms are acceptable but don’t expect any amenities in the room not even a free coffee
10,Nightmare from the start. No bellman outside to greet you front desk check in process where every request was met with a No. Beach area is a mess (my 14 year old daughter was denied water on a 93 degree day because she was not 21 years old!) Came home to the hotel at 11pm and all the elevators were down while security stood there and refused to answer any questions about what was going on and the casino….it’s easier to hit a jackpot then to find a waitress. Mandalay Bay has A LOT of problems that need to be fixed in many areas of the property. I will not be returning here ever again.
40,Loved the rooms quality and all but was a far walk from the entertainment part of the strip w/ no free transportation. The state  If was great didn't have any issues with my room it was clean and spacious.
50,"Vegas is not ""fully open"" but the Mandalay Bay management and staff did an exceptional job. I always felt safe and they met all reasonable Covid-19 rules and controls. Pool was great- gambling was safe and limited dining was excellent."
10,Stay away from here. All their employees hated being at work and it shows. From beginning to end I could definitely say this was the worst Vegas experience I had in my over 40 times being there. Awful!!
30,The staff were professional and courteous. The rooms have refrigerators that are well stocked coffee maker with kits and water available but if you touch anything in the fridge or put any of your personal items in fridge you will be charged a lot. The cost for these items will make you go to the store and buy what you want if you get thirsty. The facility is well maintained and clean outstanding staff.
20,Swimming pool hours 9-6 their is a waiting list so if you want easy access to the pool get a cabana for a thousand dollars. Do not go on the weekends it is so packed already. I had a bad experience here.
20,"The toilets are so loud that any flush from across the hall adjacent room above below or side by side will wake you up! Loudest toilets I've encountered my entire life! Also for several minutes after someone else flushes a toilet close by our left sink made a ""glugging"" noise. The key card reader on the door fell off at my room upon entering which seemed like a bad sign. Then one of the elevators refused to acknowledge my room key and I was stuck trying to find an elevator for 5 minutes. The 50 dollar per day fee to store personal items in the mini fridge in the room is completely outrageous and not hospitable at all.  2/5 instead of 1/5 because the staff was incredibly friendly (especially the person who checked me in) the beds are comfortable the bath tub in the room is awesome and the property as a whole is generally pretty nice."
50,The hotel was great in value and provided good clean rooms with great views. I stayed with a few friends and we had plenty of room in the hotel room. The pool was great and the casino was great as well. Look forward to coming back in the future.
10,"No water pressure in room. Shower door stuck. Maintenance never showed. No compensation offered; and nothing but ""resort fee"" when requested. The experience was inconvenient and annoying enough to ensure that I will not return."
50,Very friendly staff and convenient location. Love the room! Spacious and very clean. Has a variety of food choices and a Starbucks on site. I will definitely come back to this hotel in the future. I enjoyed my trip!
50,Mandalay Bay hotel is our favorite hotel in Las Vegas. Our son loves this hotel so much because the swimming pools he enjoy a lot staying in this hotel. This will be our hotel in our next trip in Vegas again
30,though they were desperate few months ago now they do not care.  Room was not sanitized.  Front desk not accommodating  Long lines every where  Access to pool painful  Poor food service by pool area  They charge e even for room coffe machine usage
50,We highly recommend staying at Mandalay Bay or Delano and stopping by the Roulette tables to visit Fanya. She is in the most amazing human being and a fantastic dealer. She is so sweet and remembers who you are if you come regularly! We had great chats while playing and she is so personable and professional! She keeps the momentum going while also taking time to know her patrons and build a great energy at the table. Please get down and visit her!
50,We just got back from a 4 day 3 nights stay. I honestly can’t say enough about this resort. Loved everything! Super clean great customer service beautiful resort. Wave pool and lazy river were so nice we did rent chairs which was totally worth it! We took our 9 year old daughter and we are very grateful this resort is a ways down the strip from all the craziness on the strip. I was worried from some of the reviews I read before we left but after our stay I don’t know how you can complain about this wonderful place!
50,I loved my stay at Mandalay Bay Resort! The room was clean and beautiful! I stayed in the Executive Suite. The casino was so much fun! I will be staying there again soon and will recommend to family and friends to stay there too!
20,I spent a pretty penny for a kings suite for my anniversary and when I arrived at my room the first thing I saw was the filthy bathtub with what looked like someone cut their hair there and was all over the tub inside and out. I also noticed the dusty lamps and missing toiletries as well as the welcome stuff at the entrance. I called the concierge and requested someone to come clean and they never showed up so I had to call the second day to finally get someone there.
40,Rooms are clean and comfortable. No (complimentary) coffee pot sucks. But the soundproofing is impressive I always sleep well. And the pool (of course) is great. They've taken out a lot of the older slots which is a bummer but overall really good.
50,Great stay..we stayed here for our bachelor party and will definitely be coming back..love the suite!! Wish it was closer to the middle of the strip..!! The rooms were clean and didn’t have a smell..staff was excellent..the pool was awesome!!!
40,I wanted some place special and yet affordable to spend my 65th birthday. A place that was luxurious and offered the amenities that make a leisure trip relaxing and memorable for me. Mandalay Bay exceeded this for me even in these uncertain and restricting times of COVID. Hotel adhered to safety protocols and yet still provided an enjoyable experience. After more than a year of restrictions my time at the Beach & Pool areas were the highlight of my trip. I look forward to returning sometime in the future.
40,"In these post Covid shutdown times its good to see some hotels trying to get things back to ""normal"". We got our rooms cleaned while we were there and they even had live music down in the casino lounges. The pools were all available and the line wasn't as long as other properties. It was nice to have free parking while it lasts because the current situation of Ride Shares is not very reliable or available. The tram to NYNY was still unfortunately not running but it's still not a bad walk through the shopping tunnels to Luxor and then to Excalibur and then the outside overhead walkway to NYNY. The check-in/out line was long but they had plenty of staff to keep the line moving and they also had mobile options as well. If you want easy access to the strip then this is not the place to stay. But if you want lots of pool options and easy access to the Las Vegas sign the Pinball Museum Luxor Excalibur and the TMobile Arena then this is the place for you."
30,"We love Mandalay and have been loyal for 15+ years. However last 2 trips were less then expected especially may 2021.  Service at front desk is not friendly or accommodation any special needs. They pu the ""U"" in customer service this time and were not helpful.  Comp packages are the worst I've ever experienced and I had 2 rooms.  Casino had very limited tables which makes it tough to play when there are only 3 to a table."
50,Me and my two friends had the best time at the hotel. There was suppose to see at the hotel and so much do do. The pools were amazing and so relaxing. I will definitely be back soon with my friends. Until next time!!!
50,Worth the money no doubt about it! Super satisfied with how clean and nice everything was. More than happy with this family trip! If you are thinking of it just look at the photos of the resort and know the photos are nothing close to the amazing place this casino and resort is!
50,They are really working hard for your gaming dollar after all that is happened in the past and during covid. Comp package for Gold member was 2 bedroom suite 4 nights with $400 freeplay and $300 resort credit was really unexpected.
40,Staff was great - But be prepared to pay $8-$10 for a water bottle. Rooms were great - But be prepared to pay $30 for a hamburger and fries pool side. Alcohol drinks were tasty - but I would secure a loan before you go to pay for more than 1 drink.
30,The hotel is ok cuold stand to be updated at least they have USB ports in the room Channell selection on TV is poor. The tram doesn't start running until 2p whihd was annoying. Overall i would return but it's not my first choice.
50,I booked this for our trip this past weekend and had a wonderful experience. Our driver was waiting for us at the airport grabbed my bag and took us straight to our car. When we arrived our greeter was waiting for us and had our keys to our room ready. She even walked us up to our door. It made the experience stress free. Would totally book it again.
50,Highly recommend. Our second time staying here and our favorite place to stay in Las Vegas. Location to airport is key for starting to stay here but the property is so clean and lovely. The pool space is fantastic.
50,Mandalay Bay is my go to hotel whenever visiting Vegas. The staff is always friendly and accommodating they have the best pool in all of Las Vegas. It is the prefect place to stay no matter the reason for your visit they have it all.
10,I was appalled that they actually charged me $10 for one 16.9 oz bottle of water and another $10 for an awful cup of coffee. When I inquired about the charge on my hotel bill I was told that they do not provide in-room complimentary water nor coffee and that the water in the room is always $10 a bottle.
10,Paid extra for staywell unit. Adjoining neighbor partied and Marijuana smoke/smell was coming through our door. Daughters and wife have asthma. We had to move to a crappy room with no help from staff.
30,Love the idea of app to open door but extremely poor internet near elevators so had to wait in line for key cards anyway. Room had small issues that should have been fixed: couldn't turn one sink faucet on and shower faucet handle had been poorly rigged and fell off. Pool area not well-maintained unless you pay $75 for a reserved seat. Rooms pretty but expected better.
40,"The property is nice but not like it used to be. I absolutely love Mandalay Bay and stay there whenever I go to Vegas. But they seem to now be nickel and diming you for everything w/o keeping the hotel maintained to perfection or having all of the amenities open. The toilet in our room had a leak and was constantly running there were spots in the room interior that needed repair and look like they were sloppily patched the tram to the other hotels was ""down for maintenance"" the entire 5 days I was there and you were charged for EVERYTHING in the room (ie water and coffee). I understand that the hotel has to make up for $ lost during COVID but they should have used that time to make sure that the property was maintained to perfection for re-opening. Being charged $10 each time I used the coffee in my room wouldn't have bothered me if my room and the property were perfectly maintained and functional. Besides my room having small imperfections I noticed things like water dripping from a spot in the ceiling on the casino floor and other little things broken here and there"
10,Manager she was rude to us and did not care about what happen and how important this night was so I was very angry about the situation that occurredbut did not care to do anything to resolve it.my name is John Dorsett we stayed may 7 th 2021 I can be reached at 702-845-9435
20,Vegas is really going down lately I remember a time when service was much better you can’t get a drink of water you have to pay to park every where you go resort fees on hotel rooms bad service unfriendly employees casino don’t pay I just don’t like Vegas
40,I was here for a birthday weekend. Everything about the Mandalay was good except the bathroom. I loved the Cabana and overall vibe at Moorea Beach Club. The site itself has a plethora of services. However the tub in my guest room had black guck on it that I scrubbed off with soap and a washcloth I when housekeeping would not answer their phone. Another con is that the Mandalay is so far from everything. However again you can get a full experience by staying within the Mandalay and MGM Grand properties.
30,Nice place but prices for food/services onsite are off the charts. The location is terrible and relative to the rest of the strip which makes it inconvenient to get to more affordable options. Will look elsewhere on next visit.
50,This place was worth every penny. It was clean and they really make everything so presentable. The room was gorgeous! I have no complaints about our stay. If your looking for something nice and not have to worry about cleanliness then this is your place.
30,Just came back from Mandalay Bay. Myself my husband And child went. It was my son‘s seventh birthday. The hotel was nice and attracted a good crowd compared to other casinos on the strip. Hotel felt classy and upscale. Did just a basic room and was very pleased with it. Had a good size tub and shower in a separate bath.    If I could give this trip 3.5 stars I think that’s where it would land. I consider four stars near perfect and the pools were just so disappointing. I figured with the name It would have one of the best pools in the United States. It is basically if you miniature pools? A really small lazy river with an insanely long line to even get in and one really Big wave pool that does one wave ever so often. I was expecting more of the pools like we have in Texas that are huge with actual large Leavy rivers I am and are more updated. We spent a lot of money on a cabana very disappointed. It was dirty and the furniture was warped and needed to be replaced. I don’t think I would return to the waterpark and will try some thing else. However I will note my son did have fun and he really enjoyed the wave pool but we prefer the Texas pools a little bit better.
10,I had lots of problems. The toilet didn’t flush properly the shower didn’t drain properly their was a nail sticking out where the carpet meets the bathroom the phone didn’t work and the black cover on the electric part of the door kept popping off    I ordered room service in the morning. I had a scheduled zoom trial. I had ordered the freshly brewed coffee and they filled it so full that when I opened it the coffee came rushing out like a fountain burning my hand staining my freshly cleaned suit and getting all over my exhibits for court.  Also you have to pay to use the pool now.
50,The rooms are beautiful and the food is amazing. The check in process is wonderful and the spa massage is absolutely 💯! I am an mlife member and choose Mandalay for our vacation everytime!!! Good job on the pandemic too!
40,My room was beautiful but the toilet overflowed with bubbles twice in 1 day. I cleaned up the overflow the first time and requested maintenance to check out the toilet in case I needed to get a new room. It appeared to be working fine. I returned to my room in the evening and had the problems again!! I called guest services and requested someone come to the room. No one came and I called about 45 minutes later and was told that the maintenance staff would pour chemicals in the system on another floor which she solve the problem. They did not offer to come and clean the bubbles which were all over the floor! I requested housekeeping clean up the overflow the 2nd time. The bubbles were starting to turn brown. The housekeeper did arrive and was apologetic and did an excellent job of cleaning the bathroom.
40,We enjoyed our stay the room was excellent checking in and out very easy. The only issue was the location isn’t ideal for strip activities without the trams running. The dining choices were limited due to Covid which again made the location more of an issue.
50,Very nice room. Would recommend it for a place to stay when visiting Las Vegas. Thank you very much for your hospitality. Will be back in the future to stay and hopefully we could stay a little longer. Thank you.
50,Was unsure of hotel since it was at the beginning of the strip but it is by far worth it for the views and the pool. Best beach / pool I’ve ever stayed at. Would recommend to anyone! See you next year.
30,Despite paying for 6 rooms for 3 nights and paying for two dinners that exceeded $1300 each they also wanted to gouge me for another $1100 for pool cabanas until they saw how much I gambled. I felt like spending over $4K in rooms and another $3K on two meals alone would get some consideration but no.
30,The hotel is super pretty but the staff is not altogether on the same page. I have never been put on hold when for 10 minutes when I call the front desk. Staff is not consistent and all over the place..
50,The only down I can say is there is no mini fridge or microwave. But I will most definitely return and keep recommending this hotel everything is beyond great we had a great time. The pool is amazing the bedding everything!
50,I arrived there on my birthday and did have one bad experience with an employee wherein a confusion occurred but management rectified the issue and from that point forward (six days later) I had beyond above average service.
30,The hotel itself is nice and for the most part clean. However the mlife desk and concierge don't work well together. Mlife said talk to the concierge they said to talk to mlife it was ridiculous then the mlife desk made it sound like they were doing us a favor (the im not supposed to do this but will this time shpiel) by adding points to our account when the mgm receipts early state there supposed to lol...
10,The front desk staff was snappy and very rude from check in. If you want to get drinks while you play be prepared to wait or get snappy responses from the ladies walking around. Don’t expect to get in the pool unless you get there two hours before they open. Make sure you wear a mask to try and hide the smell of weed everywhere and bring ear muffs as the walls are thin so you hear the conversations of the people next to you and the every time they flush the toilet. I left days ago and still have yet to receive a receipt of my stay. This place is garbage
50,Our stay at the resort was amazing! We enjoyed the pool every day! Our goal was to relax and we did just that. We left the property a few times for dinner but everything we needed was on site. We never ventured to the strip as our mini vacation was to replace a trip we canceled to Mexico last year. Mandalay beach pool was exactly what we were looking for in out short getaway of relaxation.
40,The hotel was very nice but most of the restaurants on location were overpriced and overrated for the lack of flavor and quality especially the food at StripSteak and Hussongs Cantina the wet burrito I had tasted like they poured a regular can of tomato sauce on top no flavor whatsoever.
20,The main issue we had with the hotel is the service. We were stuck with out towels to show for a day. We called multiple times thought the day and the service and response to our request for more towels to shower was subpar. We finally didn't get them until aboutb10:30 at night
40,Very nice suite however the ice maker on the floor didn’t work and at the Mandalay Bay is room key controlled so you can only go to the floor which you are staying on. So it was very inconvenient to get ice. Casino floor service was slow hopefully that will improve when fully open...
50,tThis hotel is amazing. It is clean zen far from the craziness of the stipe but close enough staff friendly and courteous and attentive. No Wonder the MJ Show is at this hotel cause a legend deserves a Legendary Hotel. I think this should say it all.
50,We spent four days at the Mandalay Bay and had a wonderful time. The room was fantastic. Lots of room with a tasteful decor and a comfortable bed. The staff was friendly and helpful. Excellent restaurants especially the Border Grill. Highly recommend.
50,Very clean nice spacious room. We had a great view and many things for families to do. The aquarium was definitely really nice for the kids. The pool looked amazing  And refreshing. Would definitely stay again.
40,Nice destination but Covid had us nervous. Lots of people everywhere. Went to Daylights pool and purchased a Cabana. Thought it was expensive until we discovered it included a food and drink allotment then was reasonable. Wait staff was outstanding
50,Great place to stay. Lots to do and a lot of dining options. There was an issue with my tv but maintenance corrected quickly and gave a dining credit for the inconvenience. Would definitely stay here again!
50,Excellent service and great dining options. The casino floor is well laid out with. The Beach area was a great experience the lazy river is where it's at! Only downside is it's at the end if the strip.
50,Needed to get away for a couple days and Mandalay Bay has always been our best choice in Las Vegas! Beautiful place inside and out staff always friendly great pool area and a great value for what you get.
50,This property has it all. Very clean and friendly staff. The pool is the best part. It is like going to the beach without the saltwater. Free tram to get over to other hotels on the strip. You will hear the foundation room night club if you are on the 58th floor and that can be difficult if you have kids.
10,The sheets and comforters dirty along with the pillows and carpet! They give you a receipt and then charge what they choose! Without authorization! Don’t stay here look for other locations on the strip!
50,My king suite was very nice and clean. I enjoyed the beautiful room. I loved that I could not smell cigarette smoke anywhere either in the casino or hallways. And I really appreciate not smelling marijuana anywhere as I smelled it all over Vegas! No valet was a disappointment as I drug my bag and pillow from the parking structure and through the casino.
10,Terrible check in rude staff impossible to find drinks at night or coffee in the morning. Tram was running between mandalay and excalibur yet they had the steps roped off so people were having to climb over and around. Most restaurants closed still and no real reason to come to this resort anymore at all.
50,LOVELOVEEEEEEE! Third time in Vegas. This time couples weekend this is definitely the spot! So beautiful many eat-in/ bar at/ lounge there/ chill type of situations. The beach area is amazing! Will definitely visit here for a future family location. (My youngest is 8mo) and this hotel suits his age as far as using strollers around the facility. Very spacious and rooms are somewhat sound proof.
50,We love the pool at Mandalay Bay. I recommend renting a cabana for the day. Interesting enough the East lagoon is the cheapest but it is more relaxed than the others. It was just me and my wife so we didn’t need something that big. The West lagoon cabanas are a bit bigger which you pay for. Either way splurge. The hotel has a number of restaurants. I like to have a hotel that is out of the big crowds. You can always walk or Uber to the middle of the strip if you like
40,Nice for the money. We have been guests of Mandalay Bay for many years and still love the amenities. Lazy River and beach are great. Poor room view overlooking a roof and wall. Beds amazingly comfortable and knowledgeable front desk. Staff was friendly and courteous. Love the Citizen cafe for breakfast. Overall a good family getaway fir the money.
20,Stayed two nights. Room was clean and check in was smooth. Casino was terrible with none to zero payouts. No plans on ever going back. I found the most MGM casinos were tight. Highly recommend you stay away from Vegas.
50,Everything was wonderful! From checking in to checking out! Everyone had a smile under their mask and treated us very well! The rooms were very clean and the cocktail ladies never slowed down!!! Loved everything and will be back! Didn’t make it to the pool this trip but others did and enjoyed it!
40,Everything was amazing but getting our room took almost 3hours because of poor front door service. Their lazy river is one of their pros everyone should go to it. I have nothing else to add. Thank you
50,I had a great time at all the M life hotels the bartenders were funny shows were great breakfast was amazing the night life was awesome cleaning was great food was awesome you’ll take my money again very soon!
50,The resort is gorgeous!! Staff is super friendly and helpful. Prices are worth it for the quality of the resort. The only thing I didn't like is the paper straws but you get use to it. Drinks were well made and worth the price!! The view of the hotel was awesome!!
10,BAD communication as well as follow through. Everything about this trip starting from the moment I walked through the door was down hill. Rude front desk that have no clue what they are doing to everything being an extra charge. You get free coffee at Motel 6 in your room but not here! That's just one small issue my bill was wrong and had to complain was lied to multiple times about points I was supposed to be able to use while there and my room smelled of vomit. I will never stay here again and reccommend you don't either!
10,"The staff was rude and unaccomodating. We paid extra for a room with a stip view 7 months prior to this trip. We got a room that faced a parking lot and when we asked to be moved the staff told us that she couldn't ""make rooms appear out of thin air."" They had overbooked and had downgraded without offering us money back. They did wave the ADDITIONAL fees they charge for staying at their crappy hotel but because ""it is just a view"" and ""not that big of a deal"" and because it wasn't like I ""booked a suite or something they were unwilling to accommodate us further. It was a total bummer and started the whole trip off on the wrong foot. I can recommend 10 places that are better than this place and at a better price and location on the strip. Spend your money somewhere else. You will be disappointed 😞"
50,The was our second visit to Mandalay bay and we were not disappointed. The rooms are very nice comfortable and clean. The pool was amazing. The self park area is quite a distance from the rooms and valet parking is not available due to covid. Other than that everything was perfect. You don't even have to leave the resort Evelyn is there for you
50,The Mandalay stay was by far my best experience here in las Vegas. I've only been to Vegas over 100 times and stayed in many other hotels. Nothing compares to the Mandalay as of yet. I am looking forward to visit again in the near future.
30,Tram never worked over priced restaurants 2 hrs wait for pool elevator key intermittently worked wait to get into our room was hours. Downgraded our room to get in. No complimentary coffee in room.
50,Great times at mandalas bay . Super clean friendly staff and a super pool area with the beach that makes waves the lazy river and the regular pool also good food for the all family and those mixed drinks and super cool beer . Great stuff.
20,I would have given it a better score because it's one of my favorite hotel to take the kids in Vegas but the smell of weed in the hallways and into our hotel room was not a pleasant experience.    Otherwise it's a great hotel for the family. Just wished they enforced the no smoking because the hallways stank of weed. Hotel staff should have taken care of it after I advised of the smell but it appeared nothing happened after changing our room. The hallway still smelled
30,We had an issue with a broken or failing window seal in our room which caused a tea kettle-like noise when the wind blew. Our second day this was constant. After two maintenance calls and and engineer visit they confirmed it could not be fixed. Still had to fight with front desk to get moved. Room credit not applied. Not happy and not a good impression.
50,The room was available for early check in and was way nicer than I expected! I love mandalay bays casino as well! My favorite hotel/casino on the strip! Nice large screen tv with cable and a tv guide unlike some other properties in Las Vegas!
20,Pillows and beds incredibly uncomfortable. Linens hold heat in and the room struggled to keep cool. The sink made a gurgling sound everytime we ran water. The fridge was not allowed to be used even to hold our leftovers or we would be charged $50? I had to change rooms 4 times before we had a view that wasn't Allegiant Stadium and the top of a parking garage. No resolution provided.
30,We checked in on our Mgm app which was easy and our room was ready for us earlier the normal check in.  Our room was located on a very loud floor. I called guest service and they moved us immediately to a much quieter floor. We had a nice view of the pool. The room was very basic. Not a 5 star resort as advertised. Bedding had holes on the sheets and were a dingy yellow color. No fans in the bathroom. The pool was great but extremely crowded. CDC guidelines for social distancing were impossible. Masks were required only if you were sitting in your chair. Otherwise no precaution was taken by the hotel I.E.  Limited amount of people in pool area.
30,We stayed in an Executive Suite which was very large and had a view of the strip if you looked out the window just the right way. Otherwise you were looking at empty lots across Las Vegas Blvd. Shower was very small but had a huge double bathtub that I don't think anyone has used in years. Door to the toilet closet opens up and the person using that sink has to move out of the way. Breakfast at the Seabreeze was great. Staff very helpful but Pricey $24.00 for a stack of pancakes. Slots were very stingy. Beautiful wave pool and additional pools. They have a lazy river but it costs $25 to buy the inner tube. Most people bought theirs at Wal-mart. Mexican restaurant Hussongs is terrible. Great Gringo food but that is about it.
40,The pool was nice the rooms are very comfortable great casino. Not enough smaller fast food type restaurants available....especially after 10pm. Too far from the rest of the strip (tram was broken!)
50,I enjoyed myself and so did my husband. We relaxed and lounged and we partied and had a good time! We will definitely be back! This is a must have experience. Everyone should stay at a hotel  Like this at least once in their lives.
10,Beware of the chairs cause they don’t clean them ever.  We rented a cabana and the chairs were not clean and only got worse in the nearby area.  I hope this review will get to whoever can make this place cleaner.
50,This trip was for my friend's 21 birthday and from the moment we started checking at the front desk it became a memorable trip. I told the staff member that it was my friend's 21 birthday and after checking her id they upgraded our room and view. Then gave her a coupon for one free drink at the bar. Our room was amazing!! Whenever you can watch tv on your mirror in your bathroom you can't really complain. Besides being at the very south end of the strip this is a fantastic hotel. Now that it's pool season and the temperature is heating up I would stay at the this hotel just to visit their pool. One of the best on the strip. I highly recommend this hotel it will not disappoint.
20,We got in at around 12 am and waited to check in for 30 minutes. I could barely understand the gentleman at the front desk. I usually can understand people with accents but he spoke way too fast and I had trouble hearing him. He decided we needed an upgrade at the hotel next door for an additional 80 dollars a night. I just wanted my king suite. It was just my husband and I and we just wanted to go to bed after traveling. If I wanted an upgrade I would have asked and slipped him a twenty. Restaurants were the price as expected but quality was way down. We ate at Hazel and Kumo. Hazel has frozen chicken strips and frozen beef patties. I could have gone to in and out burger for better. Kumo had odd tasting pork belly bao..could have made it better myself and the shrimp in the fried rice were still grey...undercooked.. to get any comps they say you have to spend at least 100 bucks at the casino. With food and gambling we spent at least 1500 and no comps. In order to enjoy the pool you had to be in line an hour before it opened. For 40 bucks a day in resort fees it was not worth it. Plus transportation anywhere from Mandalay was hard to get. No Uber or Lyfts only taxi that you had to wait at least 20 minutes for. So disappointing.
30,This casino is usually a wonderful place to stay. An incident with missing items and damage to my room makes me average this rating to a 3. We spent most of our time away from the room and on our second to last day we were away from 7am (no damage) to 3:45pm (damaged chairs and missing items). It is probably my fault for not storing my personal belongings in the safe but a Resort such as this should vet their (assuming cleaning) staff better. You can clearly see what appears to be three finger impressions as if someone tried to rip out the bottom of one of our chairs. They clearly failed and used some sort of pointy object on the other chair and successfully ripped the underside in half. This to me seems like an attempt at either the casino or the staff to make it look like my ESAs (two French bulldogs) caused the damage so they could charge us extra.    There was also a random $50 fee on our card which we suspect was from the mini bar we didn't use. We were told it was pressure sensitive and there was a fee to use the fridge as well as any items used (water whiskey soda etc.). We suspect that that fee is due to someone moved the items in the fridge or took them completely. We never even opened the fridge during our entire stay.
50,Great in every aspect clean and very COVID safe . Friendly staff all around the resort all the dining was exceptional . Just wish the valet was available self parking was difficult for my disabled fiancé
10,Filthy pool area with trash in and all around the lazy river combined with obnoxious lifeguards security and other pool staff who constantly hound you to wear a mask as you try to breathe and sip a drink. And $20 bottles of Fiji water in your mini bar! No thank you!!!
30,We've stayed at Mandalay Bay every year for the past several years (except in 2020 due to Covid) and have always had great service and clean rooms. This trip was disappointing. Our room was not clean most of the restaurants were not open and the tram was not operating which meant getting an Uber to leave the property or a very long walk. They also only had one or two roulette tables open and most of the time they were full. I understand that due to Covid and reduced guests it might not make sense to have all the restaurants open but it would be helpful to be more explicit on the website so we would have know what to expect. Same for the tram. If we had known it wasn't operating we would have chosen another MGM property more centrally located on the strip.
20,We stayed for my 30th birthday in the elite kind3 nights totalour room had plastic melted into the carpet by the deskone of the chairs had a rip in itthe charging station under our tv pulled out when we unplugged it we returned from the strip and room service had replaced our sheets with ones that had blood splattered on them.they changed them very promptly when notified we were refunded 2 nights worth of resort fees but would have like to have been moved to another room seeing as we had several issues in our room
20,Here for my wedding. I’m not a Karen and I don’t mind spending $2000 bucks to stay by the pool… But when it costs $50 bucks to open the fridge (not consume anything... just open it) and the beds feel like they’re made out of straw and brick. Well... my last stay here.
50,The stay well rooms are phenomenal! The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom OMG! Amazing. The staff was friendly. The house of blues water was AMAZING lol. It was an all around wonderful experience
50,Stayed at MANDALAY Bay. Only regret was that we did not stay longer. Super clean place. Elevators super fast don't have to wait all day on one as hotel is designed with elevators to certain floors only
50,Rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly and helpful.    Food choices were ok house of blues was like overpriced airport food. Citizen was good.    Pools were fun we only went to the adult and wave pools.
30,Nice hotel clean however the heater/AC would not work in room. Called several times to get it fixed and no one came. Everything else was top knotch! The reef suite was a very nice room minus the ice maker would not work and there was no ice on the floor.
50,This is my third time staying at the Mandalay Bay. The pool is the best! The staff is friendly and super helpful during check in. They merged two reservations and let us keep the same room for our entire stay.
10,This resort and casino is trash. Rooms smell like the 1990s and the staff is not helpful at all. Poolside seating lacks umbrellas in the hot desert sun with no option to buy or rent any. When you tell the staff there is a real risk of heat stroke with their layout they tell you about how they are trained to help should you start to stroke out - WTF!  The cheap cup of coffee that even a Ramada Inn (are those around anymore?) would give out for free costs $8 and if you’re ever into going down their lazy river then you better dish out $30 to BUY a tube or not be so lazy and just walk the with the current. Their app also sucks and leaves you travel up and down an elevator because the scanner can’t read the room key on your phone 9 out of 10 times. Oh and should your son have a seizure (like ours did) while staying in our two bedroom king suite because the guests next door were smoking heavily then don’t expect the bedroom phone to work to call 911 or your Verizon cell to have a signal. And when you complain to management about the non-working phones make sure you don’t do it during the weekend because according to them the phone repair team is only around M-F. We spent over $5k on rooms over a three day period couldn’t get a valet to park our car or any help thereafter. Mandalay Bay made sure there was nothing about this visit that we could enjoy for as long  as we stayed here.
40,The hotel itself is great. The pool area is the best in the strip. The casino abs sports book is top rated. The rooms bathrooms Great big tub! Good water pressure. My big problem was the AC barely works and made it too hot to sleep
30,I have stayed at the Mandalay Bay a few years ago and it was excellent. So we chose it this time and I would say it was far from. Blood on my sheets upon arrival cleaning chemicals left in the tub and no mini fridge for personal use. We had to pay for every drink we even touched even if not consumed. Far from the strip.  Staff was rude down at At the beach but the beach and pools were amazing! Pricey but that would be the only think making me want to stay again.
30,First of all the staff very unfriendly. The only staff we encountered for 3 days that was friendly was housekeeping. Only one trashcan in a room. No place to hang towels.  When you want something quick to eat you have to walk to the convention center to get it which is a hike from the casino floor.  Not very many dining choices to choose from right now. They are supposed to be back to full capacity June 1st.  We just did not enjoy our stay at this hotel on the strip. We have stayed at others and will go back to those.
50,We have now been here twice and we choose Mandalay Bay because of the high class feel of this casino/resort. We have been there before on business and only got to enjoy the pool which is exquisite. This time we got the entire Vegas experience and through all our walking it is clear that Mandalay Bay is by far the classiest of all Vegas hotels.
50,All of our stated and unstated needs were exceeded by the lovely staff and property. Couldn't have asked for a better stay!    The gym was the BEST resort gym that we had ever used. The COVID-19 protocols were very well enforced in all parts of the casino especially the gym staff. They were helpful and kind to give a great guest experience. The gym was well stocked with towels and water. Also it was well maintained in cleanliness and functionality.    Every restaurant had delicious food at reasonable prices large portions and friendly staff.
20,$75 for a place to sit. The beach is small. The seating is atrocious. The lazy river is not a river it is a small circle you have to stand in line for. FYI masks are no long required as of May 1st outside when you are not in a crowd....so if I am 6ft from someone I am not in a crowd and I don't want to wear a mask...  The FOOD and the MARKET SUNDRIES ARE A GOUGE!!!!!! $17.00 for nasal spray for my teen. SERIOUSLY... if you have teens save yourself either go the restaurants at town square or the Subway/McDonalds across the street + the service station market for H20...FYI I AM NOT PAYING $5 for a bottle of water. The best part was the front desk staff and housekeeping....I felt like a guest when talking with them.
40,More of a family friendly hotel. Location is not the best. Staff were nice however pool service was very slow. More people asking you to put on your mask than actually provide customer service. Nice restaurants. Did not like the sand by the pool. Overall would not stay here again.
50,The Foundation Room and Skyfall lounge are the 2 best bars on the strip. You get an amazing view up there! The rooms were great and the cleaning service was perfect. The pool was a bit hard to access but understandable during Coronavirus times!
40,Loved everything about the Mandalay Bay from the staff to the look and feel of everything absolutely Fabulous. The room tub was epic and huge coming back soon. Thankyou Mandalay For making our visit memorable.
50,Overall stay in Mandalay Bay was very good. Clean very nice room. Everyone was very friendly. I wish our room would be cleaned earlier than 7 PM. The restaurants we tried were very good but a lot of places were still closed in April. I wish food prices would be lower even food you grab in food court priced higher than what it should be. I wish they had more variety of table games in casino and table prices were lower so you don't have to walk to other casinos all the time. Overall very happy with our trip.
50,We had a mother daughter trip for 6 people. Mandalay Bay did not disappoint. I shopped for the best rate and called the hotels directly. MB gave us the best rate with connecting rooms. Everything was great staff was friendly and helpful food was wonderful. We will return for sure!
50,We try to visit Las Vegas at least once a year. Mandalay Bay is an awesome destination with the pools great food and gambling fun. We can’t wait for our next trip! We’re hoping to take advantage of the great weather Las Vegas has to offer later this year.
50,We had a great time in Vegas and I would stay again at Mandalay Bay. The connecting walkway to Luxor and Excalibur is nice and makes it seem like you aren't so far away from everything. Down on the strip seemed so crowded but being on the Mandalay property didn't feel crowded at all.
50,Everything was exceptional even the customer service before and after we arrived. Heads up look out for the security deposit. It’s $300 and you’re able to charge things to your room but if you’re unable to afford that amount being held have someone talk with management to TRY to reduce it. It can’t be waived. Overall everything was amazing. Clean and up to date. The walk to the parking garage is pretty lengthy if you’re renting a car. I didn’t like walking the distance but I’d do it again
20,I needed a break and came down to Vegas for business and pleasure. I choose the Mandalay Bay because of the infamous beach resort. Big mistake.  I wasn't notified about the pool being at half capacity. It opens at 9 am and you better get there early as the line snakes all the way around the pool area. I was able to get in only 1 of the 3 days there! Once inside the only thing free is the lawn chair an umbrella is extra! if you don't get in you can use your phone to make a reservation and once they contact you you have 30 mins to show up. So just wait around all day I guess. I made a reservation at the adult only pool and was denied entry because I didn't have my id. They didn't even tell me to bring id when I made the reservation! I got into the other pool area but this one requires ID because my key card and room number bald head and grey hair weren't' good enough proof of me being over 21. Apparently you have to keep your id on you at the resort at all times even in the pool. Makes sense.  The room was nice enough but I got no room service and they nickel and dime you for everything. There is a fridge but it's full of stuff they want to charge you for at outrageous prices. If you even touch one of the items they can charge you for it. Plus if you put any of your stuff in the fridge they can charge you for it.  They will provide a fridge for you for an extra charge $35 for your stay.  The location is horrible at the end of the strip and across from shady businesses that need their own security guards.  On top of the price per night you pay a resort fee of $35. I asked what do I get? i was told: free local calls fax and use of the cardio room. Totally worth it!?  I will never stay at this place again.
50,We have been coming to Mandalay Bay for a few years and we have always had a great experience.  Staff that we come in contact with from frontdesk to housekeeping are always friendly to us. The hospitality has been great.  Very nice rooms Nice Casino  and the restaurants that have been open during Covid and serve good food. I know that very soon that more will open and the shows will return. Looking forward to going out during the summer
50,Beautiful clean a bit confusing when using Uber as they have a few different pick up areas. Some stuff still not available due to covid. Shark Reef well worth money. Make reservations for everything you want to do in Vegas
20,Property didn’t have the same feel as in the past a little tired  People smoking weed right outside the front doors  Stripsteak and Libertine were exceptional but seemed a little pricey but that was expected
50,Overall great experience. Clean rooms hotel and an amazing water park. The drinks and food were a bit pricey at the water park and the cabana rental was way too expensive. But it was an overall fun family vacation and we will likely stay here again.
50,Great respite from the strip. All the amenities of the Vegas strip but peacefulclean and not as overwhelming as the other strip resorts. Great place for families to enjoy together and the restaurant selections were good for families also
20,Mandalay Bay was a nice hotel but there were a lot of negatives that just made it not worthwhile. The pool was not an option. The hours were very limited and chairs were not available. We were not allowed to use the fridge. Coffee that you make yourself in your room is $10. There were very limited options for food and shopping without walking at least a mile or getting an Uber.
50,Outstanding vacation at an exceptional Vegas resort. The pool is the best and the service is always great. This was our second time staying at Mandalay Bay and we will do it again. The room was nice and clean with a terrific view.
20,Had issues with check out and the check in employees. They were very rude and did not help. Supervisor watched the guy and did nothing about it. It was the worst check in I ever had! Never seen anyone checking into a hotel get treated that badly. When going to room there was someone sleeping in it.
40,This was our 7th stay at Mandalay Bay. We received an offer for a comped penthouse skyview suite with $200 free play and $100 resort credit.    Didn’t pay taxes or resort fees! We were in room 62122 and it was perfect for our needs. The jacuzzi tub was so relaxing.    We had a nice time
40,Hotel was nice. Did my checkin on my phone so I can use my phone as the key but it sucked. Never worked when you need it and it took forever to open the room so I have to get and actual keycard.    Room looked clean till I went to the bathroom there was hair all over the sink which was gross. Also for all the fees they charge you would think they will at least do complementary coffee but no they charge $10 for coffee and dont even dare touch the water because they will charge you $20 for it.    Besides that staff was friendly and helpful when needed.
40,We were very pleased with our room and the resort especially for the price. Thankfully one of us had done our research about the pool situation. It was VERY crowded and it was helpful to know to get there early! Also good to know to bring your own tubes for lazy river so you can fill them up there vs paying too much for a resort tube
50,we stayed in a elite suite. It was roomy and the 7th floor view was not the best but the morning sunrise/sunset was good. However food options for late arrivers was not that good Subway only opeb at 10pm
50,Beautiful hotel clean casino great service. Rooms are nice waive pool and lazy river are so nice. Waitresses at the pool and casino are very attentive. Only had to interact with staff very minimal because of mobile check in but staff was amazing.
40,Really like the room quality. The cleanings was also great! Lots on location amenities. Tram to the excalibur was also very convenient. Wish there was more mexican option as quick serve. Over all we all really enjoyed our stay.
20,"Staff were not friendly bad experience from checking in view from the hotel was blocked. The room was average no plastic in the trash. Restaurants are over rated we ate at Kumi ""japanese"" restaurant. The miso soup was salty. My son ordered a combo sashimi as stated on their menu. When it arrived it was sushi and said that they did not serve sashimi. WTF!! Then before checking out we decided to have a breakfast at the cafe worst service from the staff."
40,The room was nice. Extra points for the awesome aquarium. Housekeeping and luggage service were fantastic. We didn’t have good service at our cabana by the hosts or servers even though it was slow. Any call to the front desk or concierge was extremely slow service and we had issues everyday with either our water lights and toilet. Just a huge hassle.
30,Had a decent visit and loved the view of the pool and city from our 57th floor room. Was in the 70's and windy during our stay and were disappointed that the pools aren't heated (as far as we could tell). Cabanas are basic and trash floating around the unused (and roped off) jacuzzi's. Considering he focus of this resort on the pool area we were not impressed. Also was disappointed that the fridge isn't available to use during our stay (unless we wanted to pay an extra $50). It isn't funny that the cheapest hotel in Vegas provides a complementary fridge.
50,Oh two hundred characters.....2. Hundred............beware the mini bar. Pure evil. Sensors attached if you move something you will be charged. I am serious. Check your bill summary. There isn’t a refrigerator in the room and you are paying a $45 a day fee....the frig they have is just sitting waiting for you to open the door and lift something up. Do not lift the $20 Fiji water off the little cart either. They suspect you will drink that 20 buck water and then replace with a three buck water and try to get by on them. Look out use your spider sense at all times. Am I at 200 characters yet?
40,We flew out on the 17th and stayed until the 24th of April. Our stay was good they put us on the 30th floor. Our TV was a bit faulty but they fixed it once we could figure out who to ask. Everyone was very friendly and the only change would be to double check rooms for issues before turnover.
40,Beautiful property but far for transportation (it is expensive to get to the other parts of the strip). But the property was breathtaking and pool was really nice (Mandalay pools were cold but Delano pools were so-able)
50,Stayed in an Elite suite. Room was clean and bed was comfy. Pool is amazing! My 7 year old absolutely loved it! Was disappointed that our room service was delivered in bags instead of on a table. And I do wish the location was better....we just took taxis everywhere but never had a problem getting one. Got a great deal and would stay here again for sure!
10,Manager lindy treat me bad on t phone she desceimanare me and manager who checked me in too i feel descriminaged the way theh treated me o have been a vustomer ag mandalah bay for over 20 years for t he m to come now and treat me this way!
50,We go to Mandalay Bay often and as a MLife member I had some comp nights coming and we used 2 of the nights during this stay. I was treated just as important as I would have been if I was paying for the room. Our room was not ready when we arrived (prior to check in time) but they upgraded us to a nicer room and let us check in early. That was awesome and so appreciated.
50,Went to the Mandalay Bay for a family vacation. We had a great time good beds awesome pool. The pool population limit maxed out on Saturday and we had to get on a waiting list so pay attention to that.
10,Room was not ready until 10:30pm. Rooms are supposed to be ready by 3:00. Then my bathroom locked because of a faulty screw in the handle and at 6:00 in the morning I was unable to use the restroom! I called for assistance. After waiting for over 20 minutes I was forced to find a bathroom downstairs. It took 5 hours for someone to come unlock the bathroom! My room had not been vacuumed I took pictures. I rented a pool cabana. The day of it was windy and was told that I could take a chance and keep the reservation hoping the pool would not close because of the wind but risk losing all my money $625 if the pool did close. So I cancelled because well that’s a ridiculous policy. They would rather have no money for the cabana rather than take a chance and have to refund some of my money. There were maybe 2 families that took that risk and kept their cabana. The pool never shut down that day so the hotel lost quite a bit because of their ridiculous policy. The “mask police” were over the top. Even when people were drinking or eating they were told to put their masks on in between sips or bites! They should have spent more time cleaning the place. There was a dead bird by the lazy river for most the day even after telling several people. Cigarette butts and garbage were in the lazy river. You cannot use the room refrigerator unless you pay $50. There is more problems with this hotel but this should be enough for anyone to choose a different hotel.
50,A very good place to be.  I came with my family for the first time to las vegas and i was impressed.  The way you are greeted when you first arrive and when you leave is so good.    The house keeping department also deserve to be mentioned.Great service all around.
10,Do you know it’s sad when the best part of my stay was one of the room cleaners.Most of the restaurants closed in the hotel shark reef was closed as well. The bed with heart of the rock air conditioning at zero flow. $20 for a water in the mini bar. Long wait time to check in or get a question answered. Overall very unhappy with the way our trip went
50,The only complaint I have for this trip is when I booked the room The description said rooms are vacant for 24 hours to assure cleanliness. When I checked in although it was early (noon time) the front desk informed me that my room was not ready because it was still being cleaned. Other than that the rest of the stay was antastic!! Customer service was top notch!!
20,so due to covid I had to cancel my tropical vacation. I decided on a short trip to Las Vegas. When I read the reviews and what Mandalay Bay had to offer it was a no brainer It was the closest I would come to a tropical vacation this year. So will start with my main reason for choosing them. The Pool the beach the lazy river etc. And most of all the HEATED water. Well guess what? If you call water that is in the high 60 degrees heated you are out of your mind. Tons of people on the sandy beach. So much so you couldn't even see a beach. Nobody in the water because it was so cold it actually hurt! The whole reason I chose this resort and I couldn't swim or go in the lazy river. Now yes you can float on the lazy river and avoid the water but you can't avoid the ice cold waterfall. As for the hotel at 1:30 people in the room next to us decided to return to their room to continue their party. Loud music singing an yelling. We asked them be please tone it down and were called a few choice words. So we called security who then told us they would move us to a new room. So at 1:30 in the morning after being woke up out of a dead sleep we were suppose to get dressed and pack our room and leave. After we turned down the offer they said they would send security up the room It took a few more phone calls before that occurred. In the morning we did go to the front desk and they did refund their service hotel fee for one night and move us to an upgraded room on the 59th floor. Later that day we arrived at the room to find it was the exact same room. The upgrade was a vitamin c infusion on the shower head and an ionizer in the room. And a harder bed. They need to stop advertising they have heated pools because it is an out and out lie. If the hotel was suppose to be at 50% there was no reason to have someone in the room right next door to us.
20,"We were in Las Vegas for a soccer tournament. Our group decided to stay on the strip. For those travelling in groups like this note that there are many inconveniences to consider:  1. You cannot go to different floors (great for safety reasons but not great if your group is looking to gather together and bond).  2. Refrigerators were stocked from top to bottom with high-priced hotel bar items leaving ZERO room to place any leftovers or your own snacks inside.  3. Waters were NOT complimentary and they were charging $6 per bottle (!) . Come prepared with cases of your own water like the other ""pro's"" we observed in the lobby.  4. The coffee cups were shrink wrapped with the coffee pods inside so you had to pay for in-room coffee!! What ever happened to complimentary coffee Vegas?? It's literally the LEAST you could do. Sheesh.  5. The pool was FREEZING both days we went in NOT HEATED. Kids didn't stay long. What a waste of a great setting and opportunity to get the kids together outside.  6. We called down to the front desk to get an extra comforter around 7:30pm. The gal on the phone had the gall to tell me that housekeeping *May* or may not be able to accommodate the request because it was after hours. WHAT KIND OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THIS??  7. He rain in the shower backed-up whenever the bathtub was draining. The water bubbled up around your feet with smelly gray water. Yuck.    If you have young student athletes going to Vegas for tournaments stay off the strip. Even lower end chain hotels have better accommodations than this proved to be."
20,I will not recommend to stay in this resort. The staff are very unfriendly and unwilling to help to meet the request of their guests. The player's rewards desk are also unfriendly and rude. As it nice and convenient to check-in at your mobile to maintain social distancing you will be provided with a room with a bad location and unpleasant view. So I would not recommend that check in either. Overall my entire visit is unsatisfactory. I will not stay in this resort again.
50,Our family of 4 visited here and we loved our stay! The location is great being that it’s at the beginning of the strip. My only complaint is the Tram that runs from here to the Luxor/Excalibur only runs during the weekend. They need to have it run all week. The rooms are nice the beds are so comfy! Mobile check in was a breeze. Lots of family activities in and around the hotel. Definitely recommend for families and couples
30,Our Sister's Trip 2021 was great because we were able to see our family and visit various places in Las Vegas. However there was an abundance of smoking that was unexpected and overwhelming. The pool area was overcrowded and the room was not clean & sanitized as it should be. Checking in and out were smooth and easy and transactions as the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.
20,We stayed at Mandalay Bay and the original cost was ok but they up-charge for everything. They charge $50 to use the refrigerator they charge to use a chair at the pool they charge you whenever they can. The person who greeted us during checkout blew us off because we didn't have the right credit card.
30,I had specifically requested for the two bedroom suite on the 9th floor facing the beach where we stayed in 2017. The Suite assigned to us on 23rd floor was in bad shape. The other two rooms requested to be close by were in a different wing.
30,The continual reinforcement of mask wearing at the pool was out of control...you are at the pool OUTSIDE! Cleanliness not the best! Outrageous cost in little market. Service was not above and beyond by any means.
40,Front desk staff needs work. It’s hard to like a place in whole of front desk isn’t pleasant. Hanging up on someone and not returning that call was disrespectful. A call should have came back and it wasn’t.
30,Didn't love the location but it may have been better if the Tram or more of the escalators/walkways were functioning. Getting around got to be pretty tiring. There were a lot of dining and drinking options closed or limited which made us leave the property more than we normally would have. Huge plus for mobile check-in though.
20,The room was dirty and items not amenities were functional. The drapes would not close all the way allowing for too much sun light. The room had various items left behind from previous guest including trash and hair brush. No slippers and the towels had a smell.
20,Tried mobile check in twice. Thought I was checked in but was not. After a few hours went to desk and discovered I was never checked in. Reserved a king size bed but ended up with two queen handicap room. Had key card replaced three times. WiFi shotty so I could not use for key card room access. Not a good birthday experience.
50,This was my first post vaccination vacation and it was wonderful! The rooms were clean modern and spacious. Quiet during the night. The casino staff was helpful and friendly. I’d definitely stay again.
10,Don't be fooled by the low price online. Our room stunk like weed most of the time we were there. The hotel does not really enforce a drug free or smoking free stay. It's so obvious that other people are smoking weed in their rooms and breaking the law
30,Read all the negative reviews before our trip and honestly I feel like most of them were a huge exaggeration. Mandalay Bay was very average. The room was nice size and clean. Nice bathroom area. The walls were very thin and we heard the neighbors next to us who loved blasting music at all hours of the night. We ended up calling guest services and they sent security up right away and they quieted down. We were able to get access to the pool both days we were there without issue. We showed up at opening at 9 and still made the capacity limit. A lot of people leave by lunch time opening up spaces. They did have the mask police who could be super annoying. We were actively drinking and still told we needed to physically have our mask around our ears which I thought was stupid. The pools were super nice but freezing. Overall I’d probably stay again. Would be better without Covid restrictions.
30,The stay well wasn’t worth the extra money for the air purifier and air freshener . The location on the south end of the strip had us doing a lot of bus and Uber traveling. The hotel liked to charge for seemingly odd things like the refrigerator was not available for use without a charge of $50.
50,Celebrated my niece’s 21st Birthday in Vegas. Everything we asked for was provided. She had a great time! We will definitely be coming back to Las Vegas and absolutely plan on staying at Mandalay Bay.
10,The room I was give was in disarray when I entered. After laying down for bed after about 20 minutes it was clear to me as a physician that someone had died in this bed. The smell of rotting corpse was so very strong. I still cringe when writing this.
10,Horrible check in process avoid unless you want to wait around for 6 hours before you can check in after the official 3pm check in. Had to escalate 3 times before they put the necessary effort to make it right we wasted a full night because of this.
20,We stayed four nights. And it was two or three too many… The pool was absolutely freezing and nobody could enjoy it. It was literally between 68 and 72° which is COLD! For supposedly one of the nicest Hotels on the strip it had horrible dining options. And you’d get a better and healthier selection at a gas station than their gift shop in lobby.    With covid mask rules you must wear your mask anytime not actively eating drinking or SMOKING?! So there are smokers holding cigarettes everywhere they go (even in non smoking areas just to not have to mask up) and the place wreaked the whole time right from our room—- the smoke gets in YOUR mask so bring lots extra. You will be asked to cover your nose and mouth with a mask but if you’re smoking ...they’ll leave you alone..... insanity.    When talking to other guests who have been staying at other hotels on the strip it sounded like between the Mirage the Bellagio and the Venetian take it way more seriously and were just better options(less smoky). Maybe stay one night here for the pool if you can stand the temperature but otherwise stay somewhere else especially with kids...    Also avoid needing The concierge for anything. I approached want to try and book a spa appointment and she basically made me feel like I was bothering her- did bot respond to my greeting- and when i inquired she said I should just walk down to do it myself or call myself “but I guess I could do it for you too” was enough to have me just walk away. I’ve been in hotel management for seven years and I would’ve fired her on the spot for talking to any guest the way she treated me that day!    Sad I had great memories of this place!! Will be staying at the Bellagio next time. Or anywhere not smoking.
50,Mandalay Bay rooms are very comfortable! The kids loved the wave pool and lazy River. If I had to stay in the casino area in the future I would stay at The Mandalay Bay again. We were comfortable in our room and had easy access to the highway to get to the soccer fields.
40,I tell everyone that the pools at Mandalay Bay are best on the strip; especially love the lazy river pool which allows you top float around on a tube and really relax. The only negative is what I consider excessive nickel and dime charge of $25 for tube on top of the resort fee which should cover that in the first place.
10,"Was without a room until 6pm when checking is ""at 3"" was treated rudely and embarrassed. Never felt so unwelcome at a ""high end"" hotel in my whole life. I have stayed in Vegas MANY times and this was ba far one of the worst experiences I've had at a hotel. I expected way better."
40,Beautiful property very friendly staff great pool! They only downside is the location. The casino felt very clean good spacing to feel safe during COVID times. Hotel staff was very accommodating and helpful since it is a big hotel!
40,Hotel was great clean and accommodating. Rooms are spacious and that bathtub!!!! Only complaint would be things are limited or closed because they of Covid: the tram isn’t running pool situation is awful (wait list # of guest limits) and restaurants either aren’t open at all or close early. Our stay was still really good though I’ll definitely go back to mandalay. Suggestions: better pool waitlist system and different hours for moorea (like 12-9 or 1-10) give the adults something extra for paying to get in.
50,Located at the end of the strip but very beautiful place to be. Housekeeping was the best always came by to restock and check to see if anything was needed. Front desk staff was awesome. Well kept big rooms and deep soaked tubs.
50,Very clean rooms and casino Moorea Beach Club (tops-optional adults only) pools are warm food and drink service top notch. Casino cocktail staff very attentive. House of Blues food amazing and priced appropriately.
30,The rooms are very thin and you can hear other guests on the opposite side of your room. This was discomforting considering they had crying kids. This was distracting for me to complete homework in peace during my family trip. I was looking forward to utilizing the office space more than I had.
50,I really enjoyed having so many wall outlets available making it easier for every family member to plug in their device. We had a great view of the pool area. The bathroom was nice and spacious. Overall a great experience
30,Great amenities / but their M-Life availability was horrid. There wet bar was ridiculously priced. Difficult to reach concierge. The room was very nice and comfortable. The location on this trip was average The pool was open but the hot tub closed.
50,I stayed in am executive king suite. It was a very nice room but the view from the 5th floor was nothing special. The pool was crowded even mid week. It is an excellent pool area was just full. Tram not running made vegas exploration quite a hike every day. Overall excellent stay and facilities just at the far end of the strip so if you dont want to walk a bunch you might want to pick something more centrally located.
30,Was supposed to have 3 day comp. Would not comp Saturday only Sunday. Charged $275 for basically 1 night after taxes and resort fee. Other casinos have much better comps and as nice of rooms. For as much as we gambled would have expected better room rate for 1 night many restaurants closed COVID.
30,We have stayed here many times. This time there has been a noticeable decline in this resort. Bagged dirty laundry and trash was left in the hallways to the rooms for many hours through out the day and evening. Moldy shower and toilet in the room. No amenities in the room other than the grossly over priced mini bar. Marijuana smoking by people congregated at the main entry and Uber pick up entry did not present the best image and its tolerance seemed to attract a very seedy crowd. I understand it is legal and I have no problem with that however there are better places than the main entries to the resort.
50,I was having trouble with a slot machine. During a period of 25 minutes I contacted 4 employees  none helped me. Due to the lack of help I went up to the players club and was forwarded to employee Lorrie Koke. After telling her about the problem with the slot machine and how other employees did not help. She immediately took charge of the situation and solved the problem within minutes. Ms. Koke was polite knowledeable and professional. Prior to meeting Ms. Koke I was ready to leave Mandalay Bay and upon my next trip stay at another Casino. After meeting Lorrie Koke I have decided to return to Mandalay Bay in the future.
50,Really great stay at Mandalay Bay! Easy electronic check-in process. Clean and spacious room with very comfortable bed. Access to the pools and the design of the pools is excellent! I work in pool/spa equipment industry and see a lot of them. Pool water is very well maintained. We will be back!!
50,We loved our stay at Mandabay as we affectionately refer to it. I read some really tough reviews about the pool fiasco during spring break this year but we went in mid April and did not experience any of that especially during the week. We picked Mandabay for the pool cause I googled best pool in Vegas and it was number 1.  The staff is very friendly attentive and well trained. Some restaurants shows and attractions are closed or limited due to COVID which definitely detracts from the overall stay. Also the mask mandate is heavily enforced by everyone in Vegas so that is kinda a pain. We still had a blast. Loved the view from Mandabay. My wife and I turned our room chairs around so they faced out the window and we drank cold barley pops while we watched planes come and go. So relaxing. Loved loved the memory foam mattress. Slept like a rock and now I have to buy one. We especially enjoyed the food at the Border Grill and the Ri Ra Irish Pub. Breakfast special at the House of Blues was a good value. We are not gamblers but the casino wasn't too overly smoky like some of the other casinos we visited on Freemont Street. Live music can be found on weekends but during the week non existent. Only downside is the location is at the far south end of the strip so if you want to go anywere else you are gonna hike for awhile or cab it. Not much is close to the Mandabay aside from the airport. Mirage volcano only blows up on weekends. Bellagio fountains every night. My point is that during COVID season entertainment and dining options are scaled back. Still really glad we went. Would stay at the Mandabay again but probably not return to Vegas until the mask mandate is lifted. Most of the locals said that big changes are coming June 1st. Hope so.
10,"Unfortunate to write a bad review for a place we have stayed so may times in the past but its just become a hassle. We try to stay at Mandalay at least once a year but probably won't be back for awhile if ever. we stayed the second week Mandalay opened up from Covid lockdowns and went to Delano pool several days. The mask restrictions were intense but we could kind of understand as they didn't want any heat from the state. This week we returned and the staff was better but we were constantly told something by a different person and we were doing everything they said to do. Hard to relax with staff telling you something different every 10 minutes. We decided to leave when my wife and I went to the pool as we understood that if you were in the pool you didn't have to have a mask on or drinking. We chose a section of pool where there wasn't another person within at least 20ft and we had our drinks. We were sitting with out legs the pool and a member of the staff rudely demanded that we put on a mask. We said we are in the pool and We were drinking from our beverages. She said we have to be ""waist deep"" in the water. She was very rude about it and seemed a bit obtuse as we weren't anywhere near another person other than her who came to us. She could have been more tactful and these arbitrary rules are a bit ridiculous being that entire states are opened up and showing dropping numbers. Also not a prude but the hallways smell so strong of weed. All the time every time"
50,This has always been my favorite place to stay when in Vegas (don't tell Delano). :) The rooms are clean and updated the staff is friendly and the other guests are easy to be around and get along with.
50,Loved this hotel pool staff and restaurants.  Do t need to leave the hotel if you don’t need to.  Enjoyed everything about our stay and won good money too. Citizen and house of blues has great food and of course the beach pool was nice especially since we rented a beach daybed.
50,We had a great experience from check-in to check-out. The casino was very clean and consistently sanitized. We felt very safe and comfortable the entire time. We really enjoyed the pools. We will be back for sure!
10,Staff was okay on Arrival date but my penthouse suite did not have a light in the washroom are requested to be changed it was never change so I could not use that washroom secondly I asked to stay in my stay they said they was booked and sold out a VIP casino host Assisted me on getting another room add another M life property
50,I love this hotel. It’s always a fun and nice stay here. During my last visit there were dirt dust candy and a razor in between the baseboards of the bed. I called guest services about it and was given a different room. The next room was cool but housekeeping should definitely take a look and clean between the beds. Other than that the pool/beach is cool hotel is fabulous mattress is comfortable have a few great restaurants 24hr stores and other nice amenities. I will stay again.
50,The Mandalay was a clean and inviting facility. I enjoyed my room with a view and the overall appearance. The staff I encountered during my stay were all very helpful and friendly. I would stay at the Mandalay again due to a perfect experience.
40,Took the grandkids for a weekend getaway and specifically chose this resort for their pools. They had a ball!! Spent the entire day playing in the water. Great restaurants and attractions. Will definitely return.
30,The check in went smooth and the room had an amazing strip view from the 29th floor. Room was clean and tidy. The largest problem is a 20 dollar bottle of water 10 dollar soda and a mini bar that you need a small fortune to dip into. The mini bar took the place of a hotel refrigerator and there was no microwave to enjoy a late night snack
50,Checked in to a Penthouse Skyview Suite on Friday. Nice... even had it's own ice maker! Comfy bed with good pillows and lots of room. Dinner at Ri Ra Irish Pub Fish and chips were excellent mac n cheese also a hit. Fun but very noisy. Dinner at Lupo Saturday. OMG the Rigatoni Bolognese! We couldn't stop eating it! Wonderful spaghetti and meatballs too. Excellent service from Frank. Sunday dinner at StripSteak was fabulous. Jason was a great server and the food was excellent. Monday morning breakfast special at House of Blues was a great bargain. Can't wait to come back!
10,The resort is fine. Location is far away from where a lot of the action is. Rooms are average at best. A k cup of coffee is 10 dollars. Yikes. Had to call to get room cleaned each day. Not the stated covid policy. Resort fee is obnoxious. Pool area so full could not even use
30,Cheez its on the floor curly black hairs on the nightstand and dirty bathroom floors. The casino was quite enjoyable we just were a little taken back with the amount of eateries/buffets closed due to covid-19.
50,Although it's a little farther down the strip it's still easy to get other places. If you like a hotel that's not quite as crazy this is the place to be. The pool was amazing and there are tons of restaurants and shops nearby
30,Trash in front of the suite stinking for two days until I had to call to get it removed and no washcloths in my bedroom at time of check in. Had to call the next day to get some. Other than those two major issues the room was excellent
50,After experiencing COVID lockdown for so long a weekend getaway at Mandalay Bay was wonderful. The experience was restful rooms had plenty of space and so many restaurants and shops available without leaving the resort.
10,Planned this trip for 6 of us to stay together in the panoramic suite and upon check in was told that the room wasn’t available. They blamed me and said it was cause I didn’t check in on time. Which was not true. I checked in using their app and apparently that didn’t register. Even though I had screenshots of everything to show them I checked in along with emails they still had gave away my room. So the plans for the 6 of us to stay in a nice room was ruined.
50,Mandalay Bay is one of my favorite places to stay. The pool is amazing staff are friendly grounds were kept up. Few minor plumbing issues with clogged shower and sink but those were fixed right away. I will definitely stay over and over again.
20,This was my worst experience ever at this property they been dropping the ball over the last 2 years (not counting pandemic) but this one was the worse... my room was available instead they wanted to give me another room I didn't reserve or move me to the other property...
50,We had a great time. Very clean got a good deal for a 5 night get away. Some restaurants stores spa and trams were closed due to Covid. Can’t wait to go back when everything is opened up again. Room was nice comfy bed.
10,We booked Mandalay Bay solely for being able to use the pool. First off everything is really expensive we spent $70 on two drink at the Bikini Bar then we spent $90 for chicken fingers/fries and 2 canned beers. We found a section of chairs somewhat in the shade (hardly any of the chairs have shade and none have umbrellas) there was a group of 6 of us. We were around no one because we wanted to stay away from the crowd. We sat down to eat and drink and we were approached by a lady with long black hair in a suit. She came up and told us we had to keep our masks on while I’m in the mist of taking a drink of my beer my husband has a bunch of fries in his hand about to eat them and our friends were chewing what they just ate. I told the lady “we are eating you see I have my beer in my hand” she interrupts me and says “are you going to let me finish?” NOOOOO are you going to let ME finish the food and drinks we just spent over $150 on?!? RUDE!!! Mind you two girl are 7 chairs down from us wearing no masks the entire time taking pictures for the gram and NO ONE approached them and said anything to them about wearing a mask the entire time! But they surely harassed us since our group was minority. Absolutely the rudest disrespectful employees. I will NEVER spend my moment at this hotel ever again. And the wifi never worked yet we were charged a resort fee daily! Hair in the shower and in the sink upon checking in.
50,The people at Mandalay are always on point. I stayed many times and only problem I had was the key didn't work for my room and had to get them to redo my keys but they apologized and made up for it. I don't want to recommend everybody to Mandalay only cuz I would hate if the place was sold out and I had to go elsewhere. Mandalay is on point. It's my home when I come to Vegas.
30,We stayed at Mandalay Bay the second week of April. The rooms were clean and check it was easy. A lot of the restaurants were closed or closed very early. The food court was very far away from the main hotel.
50,We just got home from our stay at Mandalay Bay and had a lovely time. There was a hiccup with our room (we assumed because of covid) but the staff was incredible and made things right! They had masks for everyone and hand sanitizer at check in. They really went above and beyond. Next time we are in town we definitely will be staying here again!
50,Super Outstanding Service cleanliness safety Convenience attention professionalism. From the beginning that I arrived they helped with my luggage checkin was easy and clear. My luggage was taken up to my room very fast. The variety of restaurants inside the hotel had great tasting food and drinks
40,The Resort and Casino is very impressive and worth the stay to admire the visuals. The casino and restaurant dining was all good. The check-in however was slow and inefficient. It seems Vegas is still playing catch-up to the effects of COVID on the customer service side of things. The room was a nice layout and everything seemed clean but not exceptionally clean. There are hand sanitizing stations available but I did not see evidence of staff going above and beyond to sanitize high touch surfaces. This was not just Mandalay however that went for most resorts that we visited during our week long trip in Vegas.
10,Missing patch on the carpet. Broken shower know. Bad central air condition. Mold near the vent. No do not disturb sign anywhere. Keep in mind I go to Vegas all the time and by far the worst experience I had so far.
30,I won a small jackpot in a slot machine and went directly to a kiosk to cash it then proceeded directly to my room. Upon arrival there took the money out of my pocket and quickly noticed an irregularity in one of the $100 bills. Further look at it and I discovered it was counterfeit. I immediately called Security and initiated a case on it but now after what should have been impossible to do I am stuck (out) $ 100 fake bill issued by Mandalay Bay.
20,Didn't enjoy my stay. Hallway smelled of milldow and mold. Outlet box came out of wall. Blackout curtains wouldn't close. Faucet dripped all night. Rust came out of bathtub faucet. Was told I had a $75 food and drink comp the was told next night I could charge to my room.
30,The rooms were nice and price was decent but food prices are very high especially for soda or things in convenience store. Don't open mini-bar fridge unless you want to eat something and pay a lot we opened it to look and ended up getting charged for stuff we didn't even eat. Thankfully we got a tip that you needed to get to the pool early to get a spot since they are limiting capacity to 50%. I arrived before 8am and barely got in when it opened at 9am. We also were traveling with a dog and wanted to check on her in the room but once you left you lose your spot by the pool and couldn't come back in without getting back in a virtual que that was hours long so we had to just leave early. The wave pool is great and lazy river was fun for our daughter but they only allow 75 people in the lazy river at a time so the line took 30 minute just to get in later in the day.
40,I was very disappointed that we had to get to the pool to stand in line for 2hrs just to get in. Forget if you were to get there by 9 when it opened. You won’t get in. This was one of the main reasons we came to Vegas and specifically this hotel to relax by the pool in the warm sun.
40,I chose this property for my trip because it had all that I wanted for a relaxing stay and the location was close to the part of the strip that I wanted to explore. Even though I was there by myself I never felt unsafe while walking around the hotel and casino floor. Security regularly walked the floor and was always near by.
10,Worst travel experience ever. Bring your own food because nothing is open that doesn’t take reservations. There was no entertainment other than one band and the street performers. Good luck finding a pool chair during social distance is in effect. This place should be closed until restrictions are lifted because they charge you full price and provide nothing.
30,It was not worth the money however I loved the location. The showers had mildew in them ice machine weren’t working. The faculty amenities wasn’t clear. Wasn’t what I was expecting from the Mandalay.
50,29th Floor spectacular view of pools airport I-15 fwy came in very handy when making plans for what pool to use. We had 7 nights. Went to Daylight Pool 4 times Moorea once Wave pool/lazy river twice.    Booked 7 almost free nights on American Airlines freq flyer miles. Had to pay 42.70 per night resort fee. Managed to avoid these fees: parking minibar Keurig in room coffee admission fee to Moorea once (had 2 make other plans when they tried to charge us $30 pp paying it would be $40 pp the next day; Not sure what I did to avoid the $250 minimum spend at Daylight Beach pool but I did. Don't forget they add on 34% for tax and mandatory gratuity to all orders. A group of neighboring gals paid $60 for water when they ALSO had free water in those little paper cones from huge coolers hidden away with (vertical) astro turf. 2 B honest head honcho talking to the line up at 11 am told us about it !    I literally had to RUN AWAY from waitress at Foundation Room rooftop bar. At first doorman slipped ME the $100 minimum bombshell as HE BRISKLY WALKED AWAY FROM ME. Not sure why he told me as he had been talking to my friend the whole way up the elevator and into our seats. We were seated at opposite ends of a long long sofa with loud music in their VIP room.  I had 2 tell waitress that's a non-starter. She got it waived. I asked for a club soda. She asked for a credit card. I didn't explicitly answer her request but wanted to know the price. She said <$20. I wondered if the foundation room also had a +34% add on. I ran away abandoning my friend. He returned to the room. When I asked him what his bar tab was for 1 person he replied 'it was very dark & I really don't know.'    The pools were warm enough. They were great all around. Maid service cleanliness ease of parking all excellent. A shout out to Ms. Lupita working the back of the line at check in. w/o checking in she got with Ms. Chris at Concierge.  Ms. Chris got us in the Daylight pool (using Mr. Oliver at Daylight pool)    The TV was great; The entire grounds were spectacular. Everything was clean. The hotel wasn't understaffed (but the pools were stuck at just 50% capacity.) That was a problem. Read the other reviews for their details and experiences.
30,Friends get away to National Parks. Vegas was fly in and out. Coffee should be complementary in every hotel room. Prices for mini bar items were ridiculous. Wearing of masks was not inforced. Why do I have to write 200 character minimum for my review to be submitted?
30,The resort was great. I would recommend the only issue I had was I try to add an extra day due to flight cancellation so we called the front desk the moment we found out which was the day before we were told one price and that everything was good we were able to stay but the next day they try to kick us out So we had to go to the front desk and try to explain to them that we called and they told us we were fine but the person on the phone never notified anyone or added that to the system so we had to pay drastically more than what we were told.
50,Greatly satisfied. Early morning staff put in a lot of effort in maintaining their professional attitude with a lot of enthusiasm. Although it took a while to get phone response problem on the room was fix soonest
20,We never were able to get the music working then we call the front desk and they sent the maintenance man 40 mins later to no avail. The over experience was good not great as the Delano or Four Season
10,Entered a uncleanliness room through mobile check-in (photo’s available). We’ve stayed here and other MGM and always has been average or above satisfactory. This was disappointing especially with a new child and COVID concerns. We were initially dismissed from the guest service representatives and felt it was our fault to use their new and much promoted mobile check-in. We had to go the manager to address our issues. We were credited for resort fees and room service but wanted to hear that training or process improvements will be reviewed so this doesn’t happen again. Will not be staying at the MGM location again.
50,Even though this resort is at the far end of the strip it was well worth the walk. Large sized rooms with a great bathroom. Friendly staff and security was plentiful. Little disappointed that I had to wear a mask while sunbathing but that is what COVID caused not the resort. Plenty of food choices right in the resort itself so I didn't have to go far to get a bite to eat if I wasn't on the strip.
50,I was hesitant at first because I saw several bad reviews. Well idk what their problems were but we absolutely LOVED Mandalay Bay! It was so clean and well kept and the staff is absolutely amazing! The bed was super comfortable and I loved the bathtub in our suite!We can’t wait to go back!
40,I know no one is back up 100% from covid but having one coffee house open for the whole hotel is ridiculous. If you are going to make people wait one hour at least put free coffee in the room. Pool was cold too.
40,We has an amazing time. The cleanliness and comfort make it an amazing place to stay. Bring plenty of money! Coffee water things like that are expensive. I would recommend bringing your own and putting them on ice.
40,Hotel is nice and the pools are great. Housekeepers for the rooms are friendly and attentive but those who clean the common areas need to step up. Walls are thin as you can hear neighbors conversations. The fees are excessive(use of fridge mini bars rentals at pool etc... so be prepared) but the overall cost to stay there was reasonable. Disappointed that many restaurants and shows were not open.
40,After reading the negative reviews I was a little nervous as to how our stay was going to go. We just stayed Sunday to Wed and it was a great trip overall . We needed a late checkout so we opted to purchase the VIP arrival experience. For the 150.00 price it was well worth it for us. The Limo driver picked us up at the airport. No alcohol in limo only bottled water. With this package you bypass the front desk and get checked in in the VIP lounge. VIP staff made a great first impression. We were supposed to be greeted curbside but that got screwed up because our flight was very early so im not sure how it normally goes. Also there is no alcohol provided in the VIP lounge only water sodas juices. no food either . First up Pros: our 2 BR suite was fantastic very clean  faced the strip. we loved it . Other than 2 staff members that were just ok the staff was very friendly and welcoming. the casino floor was clean for most part beverage service was the usual for a casino. Drinks at the Rhythm and Riffs were excellent. The spa service was amazing. we had a facial and massage and both were worth the money to us. They have a mexican restaurant upstairs in the Shoppes area called Hussong's that was fabulous. The food was tasty and the server was friendly. Another nice feature that I haven't seen at the other casinos is that they have a walking path that circles the pool. The Cons: We were disappointed that there was not one food venue open late night other than Subway in I realize that things are not the same due to Covid but you can't expect people to play and gamble till the wee hours of the night and not offer food at 2or 3 am. Their marketplace was open but the only food that is available are cold sandwiches fruit cups  yogurt  things of that nature . Another disappointment was the pool area. we got in each day without a problem  but the beverage service is horrible. we waited for an hr and half for someone to come around and when they did we ordered 2 large pina coladas that cost us 61.00 before the tip. Needless to say that was the only time we ordered. they are enforcing masks which was very frustrating. I understand the pandemic but it is ridiculous that multiple people on their way to the pool areas can walk by me and potentially cough on me or people in the pool without masks can cough on each other  yet i'm sitting in my lounge chair not moving and social distancing  yet have to wear a mask. Be advised that they have staff on patrol and telling you to put your masks back on . I don't know if this is MGM's rule or Nevada's but it really put a damper on the pool experience. In fact the entire pool experience was very poor. The other area that was surprising to us that there were no disinfectant wipes anywhere on the casino floor other than by the washing station nor were there hand sanitizing stands scattered on the casino floor. The only ones that we saw were by the high limits area. They do provide hand sanitizer in your room but that doesn't help with the cleanliness of the machines. Obviously we aren't too concerned because we had Covid and are now fully vaccinated but it was still surprising that they didn't have wipes. There was a regular presence of housekeeping staff though. The food court options were horrible and you have to walk a mile to get to it . I got food from the Pan Asian venue and Johnny Rockets and they were both bad and i ended up throwing the food in the trash. Dinner at Lupo was ok. The food was very good but the service was not good and it took a long time to get our beverages and our food. We sat there for a while and the server never brought any bread which was very odd since we ordered chicken parm. The other disappointment was the limited bathrooms that they have. There are only 2 on the casino floor that we saw and then there is one in the high limits area which we found out about on the last night . You should not have to walk a mile to go to the bathroom when you are drinking and gambling. The last thing to mention because I had researched this. There is a liquor store directly across from MB. It was going to cost 150.00 for rum to be delivered to the room and it was 40.00 for a 750ml of Bacardi at the Essential shop near Lupo. If you go down to the Rideshare area you can literally walk across the street to the liquor store. we opted to bring our bottles on the flight because we didn't know how close the store was and what their cost would be but next time we will probably just go buy it there . Despite the cons we would stay here again because of the room and the friendliness .Hopefully when we return there will be more food venues and we wont be wearing masks.
50,Booked a suite for the family and it was great. The hotel is in a great location along the strip. Our room was clean and beds were comfortable. Plus no mass shootings during our stay which was a plus.
30,The room comes stocked but if you have ANYTHING in the fridge and the stocked items move at all...you get charged for products you didn't use. They have coffee cups on the counter. If the cups come off the sensors at all you get charged. Ridiculous! The front desk staff are NOT welcoming at ALL. Two workers out of about 6 front desk staff were friendly.
50,Excellent trip staff was awesome dealers and pit bosses were great. Can’t wait to plan another trip back to the Bay! Even though everything was open there was plenty to do and places to eat. Our room was clean and up to date.
50,Went in March before the NCAA tournament so Vegas wasn’t as open then as I understand it is now but Mandalay Bay was clean and had sufficient measures in place to make you feel safe about their COVID protocols. The staff was inviting and helpful. I really enjoy the restaurants and shops between Mandalay and Luxor when I want to get away from the tables and sports book especially the Irish pub. Very convenient. My only complaint about this trip would be that it was hard to get food after 8pm especially on the weeknight night but I’m sure that will change as Vegas is able to open up to closer to 100 percent.
30,Not sure if it’s the low rates due to Covid but the demographic has changed. Multiple people in heated arguments in the hallways along with pot smoking everywhere in the same halls.    Between that and the mask police around the pool...I think I’ll give the new “Circa” hotel a try.
10,The hotel is actually really nice and clean and we love the room. The main problem we have is that they don’t tell you about the mini bar refreshment charge. My husband and I bought our own drinks before we got to the hotel. Not knowing that the mini bar was already packed full of refreshments by the hotel. So we decided to take some of the stuff out the fridge so we can out our drinks in to cool them down. Was charged $165 for the refreshments that were removed yet never used. I’m not paying for that charge because the drinks were never used and are still in the fridge.
50,Another great MGM resort. Will be booking to stay here again this June. The casino floor is easy to navigate with a ton of different slot and table selections. The pool is absolutely amazing here too with a real sand beach wave pool and lazy river.
10,Have been to Las Vegas on a few occasion's never have I been so disappointed I understand the states has created many of the problems but having reserved two rooms on with strip views and close together and getting them on separate floors only to have them switched to same floor separate wings one with a stadium view and not being compensated was not a COVID or state created problem it is a poor management problem and I expected more for the price being charged.
40,The customer service at front desk or VIP service is excellent.  The spa customer service a bit rude. Overall room was really nice and spacious. Food at restaurants(Lupo. Citizen Strip Steak) are extremely good and tasty.
10,I was aware of the resort fees however I was not aware of the $200 deposit on top of the nightly room fee plus the resort fee be careful not to touch items in the room Fridge. I was charged $146 just for moving the bottles around...The teenage lifeguards don’t allow you to enjoy the pools beach river area. Too many rules. Not worth the money.
50,"Husband and I just finished up a six night stay. Yes it took 5 hours to get our room but what do you do? DROP YOUR BAGS OFF AT THE BELL DESK & ENJOY VEGAS.  We stayed in suite 61207 which was super clean spacious and the bed/pillows were super comfortable. We never touched the mini bar as the room came with an extra refrigerator that we put snacks/drinks that we purchased.    NOW ON TO THE POOL...we rented two pool chairs weeks in advance for the weekend and I would highly suggest this. You can bypass the line and it comes with bucket of ice and bottled water. The chair is yours for the day & you can come/go.  ON A WEEK DAY we walked right in at 1000 and found ""free"" chairs at the east lagoon pool. Again this day we walked right in. No issues with a line 🤷‍♀️ the pool area is amazing. I love it. But you better keep that mask on while sunbathing as the mask patrol is out in full force 😷    Bring your comfy shoes as this resort is at the end of the strip. This was fine for us and we like to walk and stop/explore at various casino/resorts.    Also we never had a problem finding places to eat and never made a reservation.    The casino has plenty to choose from and the slots paid. I had two hand pays in two days 💰🐔🎰.    We had a wonderful trip and would definitely stay here again and HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT 👍👍👍"
10,We waited on the tram on Sunday afternoon. We waited 30 minutes (along with about 20 other people). We finally went to the casino level and asked an older man in a suit (obviously one of the managers). He rudely said that they only ran on Fri and Sat. He said the escalators were off and roped off. The stairs were open and the elevator (which I used because I was in a wheel chair). All of the signs at the trams were on and seemed to be working. So we and about 20 other people were frustrated for 30 minutes and the Mandalay Bay manager seemed to think we were the stupid ones. (We said sorry for bothering him.) He said 'no problem'.
30,So-so. Ran into AC issues. Room above had a major water leak with it all  Leaking into our bathroom. Held on the phone for 15 minutes while the water was gushing through the ceiling and then had to run downstairs because the front desk wouldn’t pick up the phone . MB never offered compensation we had to ask for it.  4th floor ice machine was broken and they didn’t attempt to fix it. They had to send ice buckets up which would take about a hour. Your key is floor specific so you can’t get onto another floor to use their ice machine.
40,Quick check-in nice room with a view of the strip great restaurants. Wish they would let you store personal items in the fridge as we ended up leaving ALOT of leftovers to be tossed as we had no where to store them. (Storing personal items in the fridge would lead to a $50 cleaning fee!) There was also no way I was going to pay $10 for a bottle of water or 2 K-cups of coffee but I suppose that is why the Starbucks line is so long!    We opted not to go to the aquarium because it was $30pp and reviews said it took 30-45 minutes tops to see everything. Now that Spring Break was over we were able to get into the pool without any waiting or wait lists.    This hotel is at the very end of the strip. Be prepared for a lot of walking! There is a tram to Excalibur but it was not running this week.    I would stay here again but would stop and buy a cheap cooler for the room!
10,"Was there for 4 days and was denied entrance to pool first 3 days. Last day was only able to get in because had to go stand in line 3 ½ hours before the pool opened. I called front desk and politely ask for a refund for those 3 days. I was sharply denied my request because they said the resort fee does not include the pool and was referred to the hotel web-site that says:    ""The resort fee includes: Property-wide high-speed internet access (public spaces and in-room) unlimited local and toll-free calls airline boarding pass printing notary service and fitness center access for guests 18+""    This is so bogus; the pool is what makes the hotel a resort. Seeing about everybody has 5G and unlimited data the high-speed internet means nothing. Unlimited local and toll free calls....another joke everyone has a cell phone that they use. The only time the room phone is used is to call front desk when tv is not working correctly (which was every day on our stay) or maid service forgot to do something. The fitness center was closed so no benefit there either. Notary???? Really. And who prints their boarding pass anymore? The “Resort Fee” is just an under handed way to advertise a low room rate to attract customers I get it. But you will never get me again as I will never stay at Mandalay Bay or any MGM Resorts again and I will tell everyone I talk to about my experience."
10,Lack of needed staffing and monitoring of activities on this property were extremely lacking. You’ll get high on the huge amount of marijuana smoking going on in and out of the complex. There was never anyone to address concerns to.
30,We have stayed at Mandalay Bay for years this time it was very disappointing. Bags of Dirty laundry and trash lined the hallways to our room for our entire stay. Pool rules seemed to change from what they were announcing. Don't order food at pool go get it yourself we did not receive any change and food delivery slow and cold by the time we received it. Drinks full of ice maybe if your lucky 2 sips. Location was great as we were there to tour Raiders Stadium which is amazing. Overall compared to many previous stays this one was very disappointing.
20,I’ve stayed at the Mandalay Bay before and absolutely loved it. I was so disappointed this time. Pool was FREEZING couldn’t even get in it. Bathroom was dirty with hairs and hair dye from previous customer. Took 6 1/2 hours to get our room and they never texted or called like promised. Couldn’t get through to call people at the front desk. Finally got our room at 5:30pm after walking to the front desk. Was promised a $75 food and beverage credit that is not on my account. Super disappointed. Nobody seemed to care but just gave me the same robotic response of “we’ll escalate these issues to the right person”  Was not worth the money I’ll stay at another hotel next time
20,I do business in Vegas and I like some  gambling! Not a happy experience!!!!  The plexiglass barriers at the tables are an absolute overkill! Ridiculous!!!  Also limited restaurants available! So  why do I want to return to your property??
10,We had to wake up every morning at 6:00am and wait in line for 2 1/2 hours just to have a chance to get in the pool. Mandalay Bay is aware of this situation yet does not communicate this up front because they know people won’t book. We would not have gone to MB if we would have known.
50,Clean and friendly hotel. Staff was really nice and professional. Good selection of restaurants with great food. Best pool on the strip. Their parking garage is taller which was good because my 1 ton truck doesn't fit in most.
10,The location was about as far as you can be from the main strip. The cost is very high and there is a fee for everything you can think of. Everything is over priced (example: $20 for water bottle). The main attraction the pool is at limited capacity. The wait line to go into the pool starts at 4:30 in the AM and that doesn't guarantee you will get in. We had things stolen from our room while we were out and the hotel offered no help or compensation.    Finally -- Avoid this place. Motel 8 would have been a lot cheap and better.
40,Overall our trip was good. Room was great and loved the size. Only issues was questionable cleanliness since old shorts and wrappers left under the couch. Pool situation was frustrating since a wait list.
40,Overall I liked the Mandalay Bay. It was stressful and disappointing to have to stand in line for HOURS to use the pool. There should be a better system. The rooms were nice. I brought a cooler since you do not allow the use of the fridge and I would NEVER spend that much money for water soda or alcohol.
10,Had everything comped so we decided they cared only to arrive and be forced to move to Delano in a major downgraded room. Will not book with them again. They overbook and we got the short end..    As far as their room (as I got married there so we spent 10k+) wasn't worth the hassle.
40,It’s hard to give a good rating for anything on strip now with the covid restrictions. I also felt neglected by a lot of the wait staff in the casinos. The non-smoking section didn’t have a lot of games to choose from. The bathroom door needed some repairs.
50,During my time in Vegas I stayed at Mandalay Bay. This hotel is so beautiful. It’s so clean throughout the hotel. My room was super clean. The employees are so kind & helpful. Housekeeping is amazing. The customer service is top tier. I would definitely book this hotel again. I was sad to leave but I’ll be back.
10,I understand the hotel is doing everything it can to remain open and is bound by Nevada laws on certain points but the restrictions and more particularly the enforcement of those restrictions made it not worth the stay. We spent the whole time at the beach wondering what “rule” we were going to be told we were breaking next. You had to wear a mask on the beach at all times even if you were 100 feet from the next person and this was being policed incessantly by the staff. I think the COVID enforcement heightened the enforcement of all the other rules as my son was kicked out of the wave pool because he didn’t look tall enough even though he received a wristband proving he measured above the height requirement. Overall I understand health and safety concerns but this just was not worth it.
30,The TV never worked at all so anytime I wanted to go back to my room after doing any activities I could not watch anything I wanted I had to keep going onto my phone and use the Wi-Fi that was available the other problem was the rooms AC was terrible I never got cold it all made it terrible to sleep in every night almost went downtown and bought a fan
30,I stay at Mandalay Bay whenever I get a chance and the last two times have moved me in a direction of looking at different locations. It’s a gorgeous hotel and my first time had great room nice room and the property was beautiful. But last few times I noticed certain doors didn’t latch properly in rooms. This time our phone in room was working properly. Just a overall different experience from the first times I’ve been there.
30,The Resort quality and cleanliness was very good. However. There was limited to No access to the pool and this was a vacation in hot Vegas. They had no ideal how to accommodate guests so everyone could use the pool. Also food shops in resort closed very early which left you nothing to eat. Food  sunshine and swimming is why you go on vacations.
50,After walking through most of the hotels on the strip. I was confident with our decision to stay here. Overall clean. The highlight was definitely the pool spa experience. Worth being at the end of the strip as it was a little quieter and less crowded.
10,If you are planning a vacation that includes using the pool beware the hotel is over booking and there is a limit to have entry into the pool area that people start standing in line at 6 am trying to get in. You will need to have a cabana or rent chairs well in advance if you want to guarantee getting in (and have in and out privileges)
10,Hotel is not a great location due to it being at the southernmost point of the strip but we chose for our family for the pools. Room was outdated. Walls were paper thin. There was mold in the shower. Hotel is in desperate need of a refresh. Pool reservation system is awful. They are accepting 90-100% capacity in the hotel requiring you pay a resort fee but only allowing 50% capacity at the pool. It is not clear or communicated well how to work the system. We waited 4.5 hours on a weekday to get into the pool. Ridiculous! Spent 1 full day attempting to get into the pool on a 1 week vacation. Very disappointing. Pick a better resort. This doesn’t have the location or appeal anymore. Pass.
20,The room in itself was great. Housekeeping was good. However the check-in experience is why i will never return. after calling 5 times in 4 weeks to ensure that I had connecting rooms. Checking in at the airport on the MLIVE app at 11:00 am. I did not receive my room keys until 6.30 pm. The worst part i have been traveling with my family from 3:00 am EST the hotel occupancy the previous night was 43% yet it took over 6 hours just the get key.. NEVER AGAIN
50,Don’t know much else to say except everything was clean and nice liked playing the slot machines the food was good. Staff was helpful and very professional. I just wish the rail was running would of saved some walking.
30,"We chose Mandalay Bay for the pool. At no time were we made aware that you must wait in line 2-3 hours before the pool opened at 9AM to get on the ""wait list"" to get in the pool. Apparently there were no time limits once you were in so if you didn't camp out early in the am then no pool for your family. Extremely disappointed. will not return for this reason"
40,To go during COVID was stupid because the pool was impossible to get into. The staff was nice and the room was the best part. Will try again after the pool restrictions lessen the bath tub in the room was the best part.
30,I'm a Vegas veteran averaging 8-12 trip a year pre-covid. Mandalay has been a mainstay but it's just getting worse and worse. I remember back in the days there would be slippers and bath salts available in the room. Now you have to call to have them delivered and they don't even have them sometimes including bath gel. Now they provide crappy toiletries and tiny pucks of soap like a motel 6.    Pools are still nice and it's the reason I even consider staying here but prices are out of wack even for strip prices. Beers at $10 is $2 more than their closest competitors. Have been dropping MB out of my rotation and will continue to do so as new hotels open up with plenty of offers for gamblers.
30,Even though Mandalay Bay has excellent location and infrastructure the service is not the best. People smoking weed in the pool and inside the rooms makes it difficult to breathe and feel comfortable
20,Room was not clean when we arrived. Im talking urine and toilet paper sitting in toilet type of unclean. Im assuming its because our room was last down hallway next to a housekeeping room and they probably use that toilet and just forgot
30,Dirty room  Dirty cabana  Trash in hallways  This hotel was great 3 years ago and apparently that was the last time it was cleaned. Covid aside this property has not been kept up. We paid $500 for a dirty cabana with worn out furniture - never again.
50,All around beautiful and elegant place. It was clean had many amenities and restaurants. The staff were friendly and helpful. Had dinner on the roof top at the House of Blues Foundation Room. The service and food were excellent as well as the view of the strip.
50,Mandalay Bay is one of the cleanest and bright resorts I’ve stayed in. Everyone was so accommodating from front desk to service staff. The casino was clean. The suite was beautiful and the strip view was amazing. Would recommend 100 percent!

40,like the title says it's a great place but you need to leave for more restaurant selections and if you do eat there is kinda of pricy which I don't mind but need better quality. you don't pay $30 plus for mexican food sorry but just doesn't make since. Tacos were decent cubes of meat on a tortilla. Salsa for not spicy. But overall it's a great casino and will stay again. Just will have my own car to go to restaurants.
10,No 6 feet social distance or any CDC guidelines followed  No cleaning of the elevators  Multiple people in the elevators crowed  They charge for in-room coffee    Over priced for the service received    Runnnnnnnnnnn  Don’t waste your money  I’m so disappointed  No social distance in the casino
50,Took the family to enjoy the beach pool for my birthday. We reserved a Cabana and we had a blast! Service was awesome. We felt like roalty or something. Loved our time there. So much to do. Wave pool pool pool lazy river sand! Will definitely be returning.
50,Great resort with a lot to offer! Rent a day bed for a great afternoon in the sun at the wave pool! We dined at Ri Ra Citizen’s and Hussongs Cantina! Great food at each spot. Taxis were quickly available when Uber & Lyft where unavailable.
10,"I have just check in today (04/13/2021) for our 3days stay but I already know I won't coming back. Never in my life have I had a hotel try to charge me $50 for keeping my baby milk in the fridge. Now I have to go buy a cooler for my baby milk. And their coffee display tray and fridge have sensors so if you have a toddler like mine who loves to touch thing then be prepared. They charge you for touch the coffee cups and bottles. How are you supposed to be family friendly when I have to go buy duck tape to tape the fridge and hide their ""precious"" tray in the closet. Don't tell me it's because of Covid. Are you trying to tell me that you don't clean them out after each guest. So now if the guest touch them they have to pay extra so they can be clean???? I'll make sure to leave this review in as many pages as I can to let them know how gready this place is."
20,Be aware that you will most likely have to get up at 4 am to get in line for the pool opening at 9 am to get a spot at the pool. If you don’t get in you have to get on a wait list and have 30 mins to get to the pool or you lose your reservation. This means you have to hang around the hotel all day and HOPE to get in. We were there for 4 days and got to use the pool for 1 hour right before closing. So if you expect to use the pool go somewhere else.
30,Stayed here for the pool because we were traveling with kids. The pools were awesome BUT when we showed up a little after 9am (open time) the line for the pool literally went for a half mile. Ok maybe not quite that long but it was long enough that by the time we found the end of the line we decided to try our luck later in the day. We left grabbed breakfast went back to the pool about an hour later and the line was gone. However we still couldn't get in and had to sign up for the waitlist. So we signed up and waited for the text message to get into the pool. We ended up going to the titanic exhibit next door and grabbing a snack to eat. Timing worked out perfectly because we got the text that the pool was ready for us just after we left the titanic. This was probably 2 - 3 hours after we signed up for the waitlist. We made our way to the pool (you have 30 minutes after receiving the text) and got there around 2pm and stayed till it closed at 6. Be prepared for that during COVID.  Now for the room we expected it to be a bit nicer than it was. It was pretty basic not large but clean for the most part. There was some water on the desk when we arrived but no big deal. The bathroom toilet door didn't latch but that wasn't a huge deal either so we just dealt with it. The TV wasn't working when we arrived the first night but they got someone up to fix it while we went out to grab dinner. For the price paid I've stayed in MUCH nicer rooms. But like I said we stayed there for the pool...which was crowded but we found loungers without any trouble. Just be prepared to show up to the pool REALLY early or get on the waitlist and plan your day around that.
30,We noticed a huge shift in the overall clientele staying at the hotel and visiting the pool. We honestly didn’t feel safe and would not bring the children back. I understand that Vegas is much more adult focused but I felt like I was in a run down bad neighborhood rather than at a beautiful resort hotel.
50,My family had a great stay loved the beach pool the hotel beds were very comfortable my daughter 10 years old did not want to leave had a wonderful mini vacation staff was very friendly and welcoming most definitely will come back
10,The staff was very unfriendly. We came for spring break and couldn't even use the pool. We had to stand in a line for the 5 days we were there and never even got into the pool. That's why we stayed at the hotel.
40,We were very happy with this hotel. The only downfall was the pool/spa situation.  I understand that with Covid they are limiting things but they should have kept all the pools open since they would be limited capacity in each pool area. Instead only one pool was open so people were waiting in line outside on the ground starting at 6am for the pool to open at 9am.  It would have been nice to distribute people and have all of the pools open in order to accommodate more people the ability to enjoy the pool.
50,Covid restrictions are horrible but not their fault. Waitlist for pool on weekends is horrible and cabana prices are higher than they used to be. Overall a great place and our favorite place to stay. We'll wait until covid restrictions are over to return.
30,The tables at $25.00 a hand is to high even during the week I found myself going to other casino's to gamble maybe that's why nobody was there . The pillows were terrible you could not get the pool unless you got in line @ 7:30 in the morning you get good room rates but by the time they add the 39.00 resort fee and resort tax every night it's not that good of a deal!
30,This is a very mixed review. We were excited to stay at Mandalay Bay because it seemed perfect with kids thanks to the pool and beach.    The good - the rooms are comfortable and quiet with good AC comfortable beds and nice shower and bath. It’s a 60+ floor hotel but the elevator banks work well and we rarely waited for an elevator. There are lots of restaurant options and a good but expensive convenience store. The tram to Luxor and Excelsior is great and saved some walking and there’s a bus stop right across the street / in front of the hotel to go up the strip. There’s an Avis desk right in the hotel for convenient car rental. The pool/beach area is really fun...    Now the bad: it is almost impossible to get into the pool. People line up before 7 AM to get in when they open. We got on the wait list around 10 AM and then got the call to go in around 2:30 PM which was enough time but we wasted half the day waiting and they couldn’t even give us a prediction of how long the wait was. They really really need a better reservation system for the pool.    Our room had a huge whole in the bathroom wall where they had removed drywall to get to a leaky shower pipe. We didn’t notice till we had been in the room a few hours (crazily no one went into the toilet area for hours after checking in) and by then had unpacked and didn’t really want to move. They took a report and offered $75 in food/beverage credit. Later that night close to 11 PM they called and said we really had to change rooms. In retrospect I imagine the pipe hadn’t been fixed yet and they didn’t want us to shower there. It was late so they agreed we could move the next day and offered to waive the (ridiculous) resort fees for the first day. Our second room was fine on the same floor but with a view of the airport instead of the pool view we had the first night. When we checked out online it took several tries for me to get the final bill and we were charged the resort fees AND didn’t get the food credit. I still need to resolve that with them.    Finally our bank of elevators went out one night completely. We returned to the room to find the doors to the elevator bank closed and no sign or other indication. When we discovered they weren’t working from the bottom floor we went up a level to find a crowd of people by the elevators and a staff person scolding them for going through the closed doors. Someone else took us through a maze to service elevators and said that if we needed to come down to call guest services for an escort. I understand that elevators go out of service but they really needed a sign or to send us a text message saying what had happened and how to get in / out. We gave up and stayed in the room that night rather than deal with being escorted so I don’t know how long it lasted.    We will stay elsewhere next time.
10,DO NOT STAY HERE!! Covid restrictions are rediculous!! We flew here from Idaho to vacation stay and play in pool. Pool line was 2 hours to wait to get in still didn’t get in. Limited capacity due to Covid. When we booked we were not told about anything. When we checked in we were not told about not being able to go to pool unless making a reservation etc. Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Called and talked to guest services they could care less. Asked to talk to a supervisor or management they didn’t want to talk or help me!! Ice machines on all floors no ice available. No vending available. We come to Vegas at least twice a year and usually stay here but we will never stay at Mandalay Bay again. So many other better nicer cheaper options in Vegas!! I understand there is a pandemic (blown out of proportion virus) but getting correct information about your stay while here would’ve been helpful. PAID $1600.00 for 2 rooms for 3 nights plus resort fees!! NOT WORTH IT!!!! Stay somewhere else!!! Also refrigerator in room is weighted and if anything is moved lifted breathed on wrong and the sensor detects movement of what is in there you’ll be charged!! Ask for an itemized list of charges after your stay I guarantee you’ll find something there you didn’t do!! This hotel is a complete fraud!! I can’t believe how dishonest they are!! When you call to discuss your bill the customer service/guest service people on the phone are argumentative rude and not helpful. Management is just as bad. These people just take your money and don’t care about you or your stay! Trust me you can find much better at a lower price.
10,While the restrictions to operate the pool at half capacity is a state mandate. The Mandalay Bay website does not mention anything about pool restrictions. We picked this hotel specifically for the pool that we were unable to use.
30,I think the hotel is a beautiful one. The rooms however are starting to show their age. If they want to continue to be worth the $$$ resort fee they should make it worth it. There are a lot of choices in Vegas the will need an update to compete!
10,The hotel called our room knew my name said housekeeping had found something and were coming up to investigate.  I called back and customer service told me they didn't know who called our room. I called security and they treated me with disdain and contempt.  We really didn't feel comfortable leaving our room after that so we we basically felt trapped for the last part of our stay.  Our l next trip to Vegas we will nit be staying at the Mandalay Bay.
20,Cabañas booked out for weeks. Pool Is almost impossible to enter without waiting a minimum of 4 hrs. Pool is freezing cold. We rented the best penthouse and you’d think they’re would be extra perks to those paying for the penthouses. No perks! No valet
10,We were told prior to our arrival and then again at check in that as long as we got to the pool in the morning we would definitely get in. Out of our six nights day we only got to the pool once and that was because I got online at 6:00 a.m. 3 hours before the pool opened. People were saying that they were lining up as early as 4:30 a.m. Who wants to do that on vacation?? Once inside they make you buy a $30 tube to use the lazy river and that was another line that I had to stand on because despite having huge crowds they only had one person working. AC and fan in our room did not work I reported it four times wasn't until the last day we were there that someone came to fix it. I had to go to Walmart to buy two fans just so that we could sleep and of course I couldn't pack them in my luggage so that was more money wasted by leaving them behind. The TV never worked there were error message and no signal messages on the TV the entire time internet would connect and then immediately disconnect. An employee Adriana screamed in my face and called security over me asking for barbecue sauce to go with my $20 chicken fingers. And worst day 4 there my whole body started itching and I had a rash all over my arms and legs. Saw my doctor once I got home who told me it was the worst case of full body ringworm he'd ever seen. Told him I was just on vacation and he said I most likely got it from dirty sleeping linens or a dirty bathtub which I was soaking in the tub in the room every night because my feet were sore from walking around. I make covid nurse been on the front line of the pandemic working my butt off all year and this was to be my time to relax with my son and it was a complete disaster. Wish we never even went. I've traveled all over the world and by far these were the worst accommodations I've ever witnessed. I took pictures and video of everything so anyone that thinks that I'm lying or exaggerating can feel free to contact me.
40,Pool is very difficult to get into. Unless you want to wait in a line 2-3 hrs 6am to 9 am don’t plan on swimming or lounging around the pool. The pool policy needs revised maybe time limits or sign up something has to give.
10,Everything was messed up !! I didn’t like the room it stink the fridge was broke y’all charged me for touching something I didn’t even drink or eat I just didn’t like my stay and won’t be staying there again ever ! I’m mad I paid my money to this hotel the pool was booked all 4 days
10,Checked into the room and it had no toilet paper and was missing hand santitizer like the other rooms had. Pool wait list exceeded 4 hours and no one could give me an estimated time so had to wait in hotel room with kids. Window was not clean and had smurred stuff on it. The tram was not working and the website said nothing about that.
50,Great hotel beautiful and exceptionally clean rooms. Fun 🤩 casino great for couples but also families. We loved the comfortable beds and giant bathrooms. I highly recommend the strip view room. Beautiful lights at night and the overall hotel experience was fabulous.
10,This was the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in. First of all the maids were trying to come in really early everyday even though the sign was on the door. The vending machines were broke on our floor so we would have to buy their ridiculously overpriced waters in the room. When I wanted to go to the pool I went down and reserved a spot at ten in the morning and they did not get back to me til 5-6 pm. Overall it was a terrible hotel to stay at I will not be staying there ever again!
50,Had a great time this visit was able to see the new Terry Factor show and David Copperfield. We had a wonderful birthday dinner at Lupo. The tram was working one day Saturday which makes it so quick to the main strip
20,The excessive prices on everything was so bad that it was actually insulting ($10 for a soda via room service is insane). I felt nickeled and dimed over everything and I don't even know how they can justify the resort fee.    The way the capacity issues at the pool due to Covid-19 were handled was ridiculous. They had the capacity to put people on a waiting list via QR code so I don't know why they made people having to lineup since 6-7 a.m. and wait until 9 a.m. to figure out if you were able to make it into the pool or go on a waiting list? it makes no sense.    Also the fact that they didn't allow people to go back into the pool to say get something from their room was absolutely insane. And here you are trapped in there with overly priced tiny portioned food and $20 small bottles of sunscreen.    What ever profit this resort makes due to the over pricing in the short term it will lose in the long term by losing business constantly due to these terrible business practices.    I am also not the only one complaining. Look at your recent reviews online and tell me I'm wrong.    Terrible experience that amounted to nothing but an over priced hassle.
10,Took our granddaughter who loves to swim. We are Caesar's reward members but they don't have kid friendly pools. You have to get in line 7am to enter pool at 9. And once in you can't leave and re-enter. If you don't get in you get a QR code that notifies you when you able to enter. That was 2pm the first day and 4pm the second. Ridiculous. They should give wrist bands that allow you to enter in two 4 hour time periods. 9am-1pm and 2-6. Or if more guests then in 3 time slots 9-12/ 12-3 / 3-6. That way you get 3 hours and can re-enter. Everyone was complaining and stating they will never come back. Ther marketing staff is facing a huge PR disaster and should wake up. Also we had to wait 30 minutes to get a Starbucks as they shut down the 2nd Starbucks. Why? And in order to use your points you have to go to the MLife desk at checkout. One lady working so another 30 minute wait.Many of the restaurants were closed making for long lines to eat. Until the pandemic is over I suggest you stay away.
10,The use of the pool was unreasonable. The only way you can guarantee use of the pool was to get into line several hours before the pool opens to ensure you can get in. The virtual waitlist is a joke and gives you no idea of where you are on the list or whether there is a likelihood you will get in. I signed up for the virtual wait list at 10:55 a.m. hoping to get in by 4 to get 2 hours in the pool. NEVER HAPPENED I NEVER GOT OFF WAIT LIST. So if you are going with your family to use the pool be prepared to get in line and wait for hours to insure to get in.  All the restaurants were closed but house of blues. After 8 p.m. the hotel is a snooze fest. SOOOO BORING.  The trams do not work during the week. No were does it say that the trams are not working Monday through Thursday. It was not even working on Easter Sunday. Such a busy week TRAM should have been working
20,Paid $1500 for a party cabana for my kids and family. We were told we need to wear Masks at the cabana unless we had drink or food in our hand & if we were going to pool. We all followed this rule. However we were approached by a police officer and lady who worked there stating we were not following rules & this would be our final warning. When we were never given a 1st or 2nd warning. This was embarrassing & so uncalled for especially in front of our children. Our cabana was at the end and secluded from everything. They could have handled the situation and approach much differently.
50,Just a tad on the south end of the strip but connected to the Luxor and Excalibur. Tram was running on Fridays and Saturdays only but the walk wasn't bad through the hotels. It's slightly south of the main strip which was nice because its not crazy like the other hotels that are in the middle of everything. Very clean and accommodating. My only gripe is the pool. The wait time is roughly 2-3 hours but you can check in digitally with a QR code when the pool is at capacity which is pretty much always. Once there it's difficult to find chairs since towels are left after people leave and its so full of people. The water was FREEZING cold but everything was fun. Couldn't even access the lazy river there's a line for that just like everywhere in Vegas. More breakfast places need to be open in the mornings so the lines aren't 30-60 minutes long. There are literally about 4 or 5 closed Starbucks around the hotel with only one open at a time in the mornings. Overall awesome place!
30,we were surprised to find that you had to arrive at the pool 2 hours early at even getting a chance to enter the pool. we were put on a waiting list and didn't get in till noon. all of the chairs were filled.
30,Service - Nothing great nothing bad.  Cleanliness - There was a half-drank Pepsi in my fridge  Value - $200+ per night; not worth it  Location - Mandalay Bay is away from almost everything else.  Sleep Quality - Not really the hotel's fault. Kids screaming in the next room and running up and down the hallway.
30,We booked this hotel because I was told they had the best pool in Vegas and the Aquarium was a must see. We arrived to find out you needed reservations to the pool and the Aquarium was sold out. Needless to say I had a very unhappy family.
40,We had fun but too many restaurants and stores attractions closed or full on this end of town. Long lines on strip for Coke M&M stores. Shark reef booked even for staying guests of the hotel. Cabana rental a must and still long wait for lazy river pool. Those without had to stay in long line for hours to get into pool area. We appreciated the comped room very nice.
50,So fun! And welcoming and the beds are so comfy. All the staff were kind and took the time to help us wherever we needed. The house keepers were so patient and friendly and work very hard. We will be back!
30,The hotel is awesome. I understand it was during COVID-19 they had a lot of sanitizer out and kept the place clean. It’s located away for the center so it’s a far walk to places. A lot of the food court was not open the hours listed online so that was a bummer.when we walked to the other hotel their food court was open unlike here. I advise to personally check out because of the mini bar in the room. They try to hit up everyone for mini-bar use of $50.00. Make sure you check prices on all items on the TV station before using. The issue with the pool if you want to use the pool. Someone will have to go down at 7am and wait in-line. The pool area cuts off at 2500 guests so plan accordingly. Other than that had a great time and enjoyed it.
20,The room was great and staff was friendly but we were unable to use the pool. In order to get into the pool you had to get up at 5 am and get in line to wait there until the pool opens at 9am. The only way to guarantee a spot at the pool for the day was to reserve a cabana...not everyone can afford that. Without the pool it’s just another hotel room- which I could have booked for much much cheaper!
50,Mandalay Bay hotel and pool continue to be top notch in Las Vegas! Clean modern and just comfortable! The strip views from the hotel room is awesome!    The pools wave pool and lazy river are great for the whole family!
20,Pool was absolute chaos. Had to get in line at 6:30am and wait in line for 3 hours to get in pool or else it was full and could not use pool. Also not allowed to leave pool or else you lose your spot and cant get back in. Pool security were completely rude and harassing with mask rules. I wasnt there 5 minutes to be told if i dont have mask over my mouth and nose i would be thrown out along with my family. Then i was yelled at while i had a $16 drink in my hand that i had to put mask back up immediately after the drink was away from my mouth. Then i was actually in pool up to my knees and was told i need a mask on. I said i was in the pool and they said i wasnt in deep enough. Absolutely ridiculous. No valet parking and self parking was way too far. I told the front desk manager and they said they know all about the pool but did nothing about it.
20,The pool is at 50 percent capacity so people begin lining up at 5 a.m. to get in. On a Thursday we lined up at 7 a.m. and were able to get in when the pool opened at 9 a.m. but not early enough to get two lounge chairs. My wife got a chair and I got the sand. They could implement a system to mitigate this but choose not to -- I suspect because it drives demand for people to reserve cabanas at higher and higher prices
10,Waste of a trip. Face coverings have no purpose what a joke. A stupid wait time to get into the pool was 5 hours. So extremely ridiculous. No attractions were available or shows. Majority of the shops were closed. WAY-OVER PRICED FOR WHAT YOU GET. Not worth a 1 rating because zero not accepted.
40,"Family spring break vacation. Best pool in Las Vegas with the wave pool lazy river and multiple smaller pools. However the crowds are growing. To have a better experience (and not line up to get into the pool an hour before it opens) rent a Cabana. It had its own separate check in line and we were escorted to our cabana.  Service was good drinks were ok (came in clear plastic fast food containers) food was good and it comes with two inner tubes. You can bring your own if you want. We did not use the Lazy River because there was a wait.    DO NOT get the Media Suite - unless you're going to party with a group. The TVs did not work properly and instead of couches in the ""media suite"" there was a conference room table and chairs. Lots of wasted space in the suite.    Overall Las Vegas has a lot of to offer for families. However currently you are going to wear a mask inside and outside on the Strip.    If you play table games most strip motels have a $15 minimum to play. The Casino floor is noisy and table games are limited to 3 persons per table and no extra tables were opened to allow more to play.    Las Vegas - treat it like Disneyland - lots to do you won't see it all and you should make reservations early otherwise it will be booked the day you want to do something."
30,Overall not a bad experience. Still watching my bank account to see if I am getting my safety deposit refund back. We didn't use any of the amenities because it was so packed. It was a little far from the strip but the walk wasn't too bad.
50,Had a great stay! Very clean love the pillows no complaints! Did have small issue the staff was great at solving immediately. Great food amazing bar Prohibition 1923 fatah and fun bartenders! Awesome trip for us.
50,The mobile check in through M Life was quick and easy. I paid a little extra for the VIP Arrival Experience and it was well worth it. Especially since there is some difficulty getting Lyft and Uber rides from the airport. All the staff were friendly and helpful. The room was spacious clean and beds were comfortable. Plus we had a great view of the pools below. The casino resort and property were all well kept and clean. I really enjoyed my stay and will stay at Mandalay again.
30,Upon check in the young woman was slightly irate and did not go in to detail about anything. I asked about the pool as I heard the friendly gentleman telling the gentleman next to me. The food options were not very selective and the food court/ bar staff all seemed unhappy which I can understand working at such a busy place. The pool was super packed but the rooms are beautiful and everything is very clean!
20,We went there with 15 other guest for our wedding. The wedding itself and the reception at Citizens was FABULOUS. Basically everything else went wrong. During check in our room wasn’t ready and they mislead how they would notify us when ready. The elevator didn’t work for at least two days. We didn’t get part of our room service and when we called the in room dining sent us somewhere else after being on hold for 25 mins and that person said they were supposed to help us. Danny made that right. You can’t use the pool unless you go to the pool 2 hours before it opens. The list goes on.
10,The Mandalay Bay lowered prices to get customers but due to COVID restrictions they can't accommodate anyone using anything. Pool is closed by 9AM or you can pay $500 to sit in a daybed with pool access.
40,The attention to details and customer service has dropped. The staff is still very friendly but that only goes so far. Asking for room issues to get fixed fell on deaf ears. Food errors at the pool were consistent. Pool is not heated. Libertine Social has great food but the price suggests Coat and Tie atmosphere and service.
10,We stayed at Mandalay Bay for four nights beginning on March 17th 2021. The person that checked us in was very rude. We could not understand him or hear him at all and when we asked for a map of the hotel and basic directions he simply pointed to a QR code to access that information. I didn’t have the app so we were completely clueless we attempted to ask more questions and he completely ignored us and went to the next person. When we received our bill after our stay we found that the same rude check in person had deceitfully charged us for upgrades we did not agree to!!! I have contacted Customer Service three times to have the charges removed from the bill and the first two times they stood behind their staff 100% indicating there were notes we agreed to the up charge which we DID NOT! I have never dealt with a company where the customer is always wrong! Throughout our stay almost every person in this hotel could have cared less if they helped us or not! We will NEVER stay here again!
50,The staff at Mandalay Bay were phenomenal and the room and pool was amazing! We were definitely pleased with every aspect of our stay! We recommend downloading popslots app to get rewards before you go!
30,First (and last) time staying at this property. It's fine if you don't want to leave the hotel and only want to gamble and are okay eating at the food court. I however was looking for at the very least pool time and good food. Unfortunately the resort sold 100% of their rooms while keeping the pools at 50% capacity and keeping the majority of their restaurants shut down. So I ended up in line at 6am every morning in hopes of being admitted into the pool complex before they got to capacity. It's also so far from the busy part of the strip that it's necessary to take a taxi most places. That will improve once the tram starts running again but I like to walk so this property is just not for me.
50,This is my second time tooting the horn of Mandalay Bay. I am very pleased with customer service the amenities are great. The pool area has no other competition . The MGMBET and Sports Book are easy to access.
30,Extra fees for everything in the room even the refrigerator. Charged to make a cup of coffee in the room. Will not recommend due to a la cart charges in the room!!!! Not economical. Charged $50 per day to use the fridge in the room. Horrible
50,I highly recommend staying at Mandalay. It’s just far enough to keep the weekend craziness away from the lobby of your hotel. The room was great(elite king) casino was great and not ridiculously overwhelming with cigarette smoke and the grounds are absolutely beautiful
40,Visit April 2021 a lot of things still not open. Mandalay was nice but too far from central strip over priced amenities. The pool was impossible to get in to. Stopped trying after the first day there.
10,My family came because Mandalay Bay had a wave pools and lazy lagoon. They opened the pools 9am.... the first day we went at 9 AM and we were not let in because they were at full capacity....we didn’t get called in until almost 5 hours later so we were only able to enjoy the pool for three hours. Second night I decided to go there at 7 AM in the morning. Got to the front of the line they were full capacity again!!! we didn’t get called in until four hours later so we were only able to enjoy the pool for again 3 to 4 hours. We spent half of our day just waiting for them to Texted us the first night they never did So I had to talk to the front desk and then finally they let us in only because I called.  We had a problem with our shower it was not working. The water would fluctuate hot and cold about 15 times while you were showering. Called maintenance never showed up. Also I came in with a boot on my foot because of an injury so I thought that the tram would be open but it was NOT!!! I wanted To can go to the next casino but that was not possible. The tram was closed the entire time we were there so I was forced to stay at the Mandalay Bay not able to enjoy the rest of the casinos. I asked front desk if they were going to open the tram at any time because I wanted to go to the next casino they told me nonto go get an Uber or walk there. Yikes!!!
50,Everything you need is here. High end shopping and restaurants to an affordable food court and slots. Plus the ambiance is second to none. Every time I come to Vegas I stay here because I know I am getting quality for my money.
30,Had to wait on hold for 30-45 minutes before guest services picked up. Hotel is 90% capacity but pool is 50% so you have to be in line 3 hours prior to the pool opening in order to get in. Masks are required while sitting in chairs and out of the water but those in the water can be shoulder to shoulder with no mask. No fridge in room and was going to be charged 35/night for it. Very disappointed
50,This was our first time staying here and we will definitely be coming back. It was very clean rooms were clean and beds were comfy. Lots of places to eat. Great casino. We plan to bring our kids next time. Very kid friendly.
10,Hotel is not accommodating to guests with handicaps. My daughter has cerebral palsy and we couldn't get a chair or an umbrella. Non hotel guests bought all the chairs and cabanas. They got into the pool and didn't have to wait. While I paid to stay there and had to start lining up for the pool at 5am.
50,Were in for our daughters wedding. Room was very nice and comfortable. The hotel seemed to be smoke free which was fantastic and hope they will keep it that way. Did not use the pool but have heard its the best on the strip.
10,Problems beginning to end. We had issues getting key cards to work. Majority of restaurants weren’t open. We had to walk next door to Luxor where they had all their restaurants open! The pool situation was awful we chose Mandalay because of the beach but the line was 6-8 hours long everyday and we never got to experience it: we walked next door to Luxor and used there nice pool no issues no wait. Also we got charged $50 plus $10 each for sodas out of the room fridge that we didn’t touch or drink. I called daily to get them to check the fridge to show them we had not drank them. Still not resolved and we checked out yesterday after 4 nights there. Don’t stay at Mandalay.. go next door to Luxor where you can use the pool and have places to eat!
50,For taking a trip during a pandemic we were not too sure what to expect out of a resort in regards to safety of guests and staff. Mandalay Bay provided an amazing experience even with the protocols and regulations put in place. They did an excellent job at providing a safe atmosphere that still allowed guests to fully enjoy their stay at the resort. Mandalay Bay is perfect for all people whether it be a couple family or friends. We love the large open casino floor that makes social distancing very possible and does not feel like people are all over you unlike some of the other casinos on the strip. It’s a great place to be and we highly recommend staying at Mandalay Bay for your Vegas trip.
30,No pool access or you will have to line up at 6:00 AM to see if you will be let in. Once you are in you can’t leave. Pool opens at 9:30 so 3 1/2 hour wait and there will be 200-300 people at that time already waiting. You will not be able to reserve a spot for later in the day or if you are able you will be called 5 hours later near closing time.    Also most restaurants and bars are closed. Uber or lift takes a good 20-30 minutes and that is if they don’t cancel on you.    Overall a real headache to visit during covid times.
20,I stayed for 1 night hoping to experience the pool. Only to find out that you need a reservation to get into the pool area. The reservation start when they reached the 25% capacity which is fast. They expect you wait around all day in hope’s to get your toes wet. If your staying 1 night you are screwed. It will never happen. There was a line to get in at 7 am the day I checked out.
50,We just had to get away. Last year was rough on everyone and we definitely needed a break. The Resort is beautiful the weather was beautiful and the rooms are always clean and well equipped. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly and go out of there way to take care of needs and concerns. Mandalay Bay is an excellent choice and we will stay there again for sure....:)
40,Hotel was clean and beautiful reasonably priced. Lots of food options in the food court. Shark reef was overpriced and very far away from the main lobby. The reason we stayed in this hotel was for the beach and everyday it waitlisted in 30 mins and took 3+ hrs to get a text back. Kids were bored to tears and we couldn’t go far in case we were called. If you don’t show up in 30 mins you lose your spot.
10,Terrible!! DO NOT stay here!!! I went with kids to enjoy the pool and it was impossible to do so. We were in line when they open at 9am and stood for over an hour. Then they told us to put our name on a waitlist that took over 5 hours... so frustrating. No chairs dirty rude staff... will never go back!!!!
30,Vegas is not the place to visit in 2021. All shows are cancelled. The hotels are about half staffed. Customer service is really bad. Front desk staff are not very intelligent. Wife had a walker and they put us in a room opposite of the elevators. Had to rent a scooter.
40,Over all stay was wonderful. The only thing I didn’t like was following up (after waiting about 2 hours on the status of my room) was being told “just because Check-in is at 3 pm doesn't mean your room was going to be ready”. I didn't get keys to my room till around 6pm
20,"Pool wait times were ridiculous guests waiting on line since 530am to get in at 9am. Staff was very un organized. Rooms were cleaned and smelled as they were properly cleaned and disinfected. Front desk double charged me the incidental fees because of a ""known glitch in their system"". Instead of being properly checked in for our entire trip we were checked out and had to go downstairs to recheck in wasting valuable time waiting in long lines again."
40,Had a great stay at the Mandalay Bay. Had an issue with the digital key not being issues and front desk staff as well as people on the phone where super helpful and polite. Rooms were clean and very roomy. The only issue we had was we never made it to the pool as people started lining up at 7am for a 9am opening. Lucky we are not big pool people and my son is older so this wasn’t the main focus. It just would have been nice to go down if we wanted to. Cabana and gazebo rentals are majorly inflated for this week which was ridiculous and many went un-rented. I feel the resort fee should be discounted if you can’t access the pool. The only other item was the hotel was out of extra pillows which meant a few crappy nights of sleep. Other than that nice hotel and free in room internet made for a pleasant stay.
50,Great resort clean hotel room I felt safe on the property however if you're planning to go swimming in the pool during COVID get in line around 7 a.m. or you will not get in. The pool has a capacity max of 700 and the line starts forming around 06:00 hours.
50,Pool rooms and casino all easy access. Friendly staff and a lot of places to eat. Nice clean rooms. Big Windows from ceiling to floor. Showers are nice walk in glass doors . Nice big clean restrooms everywhere.
50,Keep the comps coming and I will keep coming Thank you  would like to see a 5 day comp hopefully next time you will have the ice machines working would like to see the cafe and buffet open next time.
10,willmnot be back. I reserved a 1450sq foot room for my kids and I the room literally fell apart around us. booked there for the pool even after making sure three times the pool was open could not get anywhere near it......unless you plan on spending your trip in line from 6 am on for the pool or sitting in your room waiting on maintenance stay somewhere else. maintenance staff was very kind........nicest thing I have to say
10,The location is not great being at the far end of the strip. Let's be honest we stay here because of the pool. But when limited pool capacity means waiting in line 3 hours before opening or not getting in at all why are we here? The restaurants that were good but not enough were open to again meet the demand. Besides the aquarium there really is nothing else to do here. We'll stay somewhere more central that is better equipped to handle crowds.
10,long lines for pool would not recommend as only good thing is pool and which is not guaranteed!! To get into the pool you need to wait in line from 6 am (pool open at 9) !! hotel should be providing reservation for pool entry at the time of booking so guests knows of they want to book without pool avaiblity.
30,Was only there for 3 days this time brought the kids for the first time ever! Kids were super excited about going to the pool since we had a great view from our room of the pool area! Change into our pool clothes just to go down and to be turned away saying there was a 3 1/2 hr wait to get in! Got put on waiting list only to never be notified of our time to get in! Called down and the lady told me we need to get down to the pool at 5:30-6am just to make sure we get in and the pool doesn’t open until 9am WOW! So next morning we did just that! Waited around in line for 3 hrs to get in. Once we got in we were obviously hungry so waited in line to get food we bought the $18 dollar cheese burgers which were Disgusting the bread was stiff almost hard and the beef patties were super dry! Took them back to explain and exchange for fresh burgers only to be handed back the same quality again! This day was a bust already! Kids went to play in the pool for a few hrs because we weren’t about to leave after we just stood in line for 3hrs. After we left the pool we tried to find something else kid friendly to do! So we said hey let’s go to the aquarium since the lady at check-in said we could get in free because I was platinum! Well we change clothes go down to the aquarium only to find out it’s completely booked for 5 days! Wtf!!! At this moment this trip just keeps getting worse!! Well let’s go to dinner I said so we went to house of blues sat down and ordered! Kids both got the $25 dollar fried chicken and mashed potatoes! What a waste of money!! The chicken came out over fried and dry with honey pored on top kids wouldn’t even eat it! We just charged it to the room since I had some credit! I would have never paid if it was my own money! Had to leave to hotel just to find something else decent to eat! After that we just stayed away from the hotel and tried to enjoy the rest of our time in Vegas!
10,I planned to enjoy the pool a few days while I was in Las Vegas but there were so many people that it made it impossible to get in. You had to go down to the pool area early in the morning to get on the waiting list! I stayed up late so I didn't wake up early :( I think there should be a time limit people can be in the pool because it is not fair for adults with no children that go to Vegas and stay up late to miss out on the pool. Also I did not like the fact that I would get charged $50 just for opening the fridge! I do not plan on visiting Vegas again.
10,Went this month. Hotel was busy but they don’t have a lot of things open that should be. Like a lot of reataurants that should be open are just randomly closed? Also suite upgrade was very dated and not working properly. Would not recommend.
10,Dusty dirty room. Dirty towels in corner when we checked in. Dust covering your $20 bottle of water. $50 per day charge to use the mini fridge?? Dated LCD. Beverage machine offers credit card use but freaks out and freezes after the machine times out trying to authorize transaction and fails (it's clearly being blocked from the internet by your user terms and agreement page needs a firewall exception added) but to make it worse after it freezes it wont take change or cash for 1+ hours. So no juice for you! Lmao.. Slot machines are insanely greedy. Bet more win less? Wtf.. I have always won $50 for every $100 I bet. Until now. And you lower the payout on a sliding scale as I bet higher.. no tram. Restaurants open as they please regardless of schedule posted on the website (starbucks.. 4/6 or 4/7 2021). Holy dirty rooms not being vacuumed. If they're not being vacuumed literally the easiest job of housekeeping why would I ever believe they're being cleaned or sanitized in any way?.. and the $20 bottle of water COVERED in dust... you guys block elevator floors with rfid cards. But a baby could access the liquor in the mini bar the $22 bottle of liquor with the $1.65 tax. Yeah. A baby accessed it.. of course you immediately charged me for it. I mean immediately! The second it was rocket forward. You guys seen me coming. .But why would anyone recommend this as a good option ever? Stay somewhere that cares about guests
20,"The room: several issues  1. Bathroom TV didn't work upon arrival  2. 2nd day: One bed made by the maids the rest left untouched  3. 3rd day: No beds made no towels provided had to wait an hour for towels to be delivered at 11 pm. No maid service  4. 3rd day: Bathroom lost all the power.  5. Big trash bags were sitting everywhere outside the rooms. I have a picture if you would like to see it.    6. 4th day: One one bed made in the room rest left untouched    The pool:  1. Hotel sold more rooms than what the public spaces can accommodate. The line for the pool in the morning went from the POOL DOORS all the way around to the entrance to the CONVENTION CENTER.  2. Guests not able to use the facility due to overcrowding    The restaurants:  1. Again more rooms sold than what the restaurants and other public spaces can support with the limited opening capacity. My family had to PAY to Uber to other locations for all meals since we were not able to get a reservation on-premises.  2. Only one coffee shop opened at the time. The lines were ridiculous.    The managers:  1. The first manager I spoke to about the room cleaning bathroom power issues and pool options was nothing short of rude. Her comments were verbatim:  ""I cannot open the restaurant just for you""  ""I cannot open the pool just for you""  ""What do you want me to do? You are getting upset with anything I say.""  ""When I go on vacation I plan in advance to be adequately prepared. I make sure my family is taken care of"" (I am assuming this indicates that I did not take care of my family?)  ""You can call Uber Eats and other delivery services and you can also use Uber to go elsewhere""  2. The second manager I spoke to after the hotel totally cancelled the cleaning service without letting the guest know was understanding and curteous. Perhaps the one I spoke to first could use additional training.      I understand the limitations that the pandemic brought up for all of us. However the re-opening was handled very poorly by Mandalay Bay. It was disappointing for a hotel of this reputation to allow for this to happen. Very disappointing and embarrassing for Mandalay Bay. It makes it really difficult to recommend anyone to stay at your hotel.  Wishing you all the best in the future."
20,The service was CRAP.  The slots was mostly CRAP.  The accommodation was CRAP.  The room was CRAP.  The Birthday Gift is CRAP.  The best part is that the Toilet Flushes Really Well. The room has a fridge but you can’t store any of your belongings in there... so again that’s CRAP.
10,service was terrible and no help after complaint made deposit is ridiculous and maid service horrible they said would be back to clean room and never went back. pool too cold for little kids we scheduled our family vacation and were very dissatisfied.
30,Getting into the pool was ridiculous. There was at least a 5 hour wait each day and people were camped out at 6 am to get in. There should be some kind of rotation so that more people are able to enjoy the pool especially with limited capacity. Elevators went down one night and we had to walk down 26 flights of stairs nearly making is late for a show. Overall not a great stay.
10,The hotel room was not the one we had made a reservation for and had also called about the room. There were dirty towels in the room and no housekeeping. I understand it being COVID but we had been to other hotels and the housekeeping was just fine
30,Great place but the service at the pool was very slow. Over 90 minutes just to place an order for multiple days in a row. Didn’t help that the elevators weren’t working on our last night and we were trapped on our floor. However overall it was a nice place nice rooms pleasant staff and a quiet area of the strip.
20,It’s not as great as you think! First of all its crowded they weren’t controlling the crowd at the pool area second of all never ever forget anything ones u go to the pool area esp ur atm or else you won’t get in again without being on the waiting list. I forgot to bring my cards so I ask the staff if I could get it coz I need to purchase foods for my kids from the food court but staff told me I have to wait again if I go out. Wow that’s pathetic!!!! Just to get my ATM from my hotel room? Really? More that 2000 people on the wait list and more than 4 hrs waiting. U will end up wasting your day. They don’t provide their trash bags. Bring your own plastic bags. Make sure u call guest services during certain hours nobody will pick up the phone esp at night time:-( well as I was expecting guest services should be 24hrs right? I m not staying in this hotel again!
50,Me and my GF went down right before March Madness and had a great time. The crowds were still light so getting around town via Lyft was fairly easy. The Casino is nice and the room we stayed in was like a Suite and it was veeerrrryyy nice. Room service was prompt. The front desk was helpful and informative. The hotel itself sits off the strip but its really not that big of a deal. A quick 5 min right puts you right back into the mix of things.
10,How do you charge a resort fee when you can’t even get into the pool and nothing was open . We had holes in our sheets and springs coming through the mattress .lied to about shark reef ticket times and then told sorry you were misinformed . We left the night before check out . What a horrible hotel
40,A little far from the strip for us and it was really hard to get into the pool. Friendly staff very clean casino and rooms… Was a good experience but will try elsewhere next time. If you like to be away from the strip this is for you. A lot of kids at the pool long waits at the lazy river. That is good because the lazy river isn’t overcrowded but you have to wait a long time to get in it because of social distancing
30,"Hotel was Fine lack of signage from the elevator to the hotel lobby ended up taking the long way which as a disabled veteran was frustrating and painful.  Charged quite a high ""Resort Fee"" for no resort facilities at least Dick Turpin wore a mask when he robbed you that was just insane to do that.  Can't comment more as previously stated - everything was closed except the slots and some tables so the resort fee was a fee to play the cash operated slots?"
50,I love The Mandalay Bay. It is such a classy hotel. The staff is the greatest so polite and helpful that makes you stay wonderful. All the amenities are top notch in my books. I especially love the summertime with all the beach parties in the pool area.
20,Room issues customer service issues not very clean staff not very friendly. 1st room had plum Room issues customer service issues not very clean staff not very friendly plumbing issues. Shower wasn’t draining and backing up into tub. Hallway and tash didn’t seem to get cleaned very often
20,overall I was disappointed with the mgm/mlife experience. There wasn't enough staff to keep guests from waiting in lines restaurants were not open or booked up my wife didn't receive her freeplay. We also found out the week we were to arrive that our reservation had been moved to the Delano. A very nice room  but not where we wanted to stay. Also the pool was closed which I understand why but no communication. I doubt we will return to the strip we had more fun at freemont street and spent a third of the money !
20,Most of hotel was really clean but our room area was really dirty also hard to sleep with green neon lights shining through our room even with darkened shades closed. Went to pool as soon as they opened at 9 and were turned away because they were at capacity. I understand it’s COVD time but they were really rude about it and it seemed as if they were trying to rent out cabanas instead of letting people just go hang out. How do you have room for people buying cabanas and not for people who are not when you say it’s first come first serve. We came just for the pool and it made our smaller kids cry very rude and unprofessional workers handling the pool area. We wanted a quick getaway for spring break and to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Other staff members however were very kind more so than other hotels we’ve stayed at.
50,We had fun and satisfaction in our stay at Mandalay Bay Resort. Highly Recommended. We are looking forward for another visit in the future. We will definitely stay there a bit longer. Our trip was short but satisfied with our stay.
50,Awsome Customer Service All Around! Facility beautiful and access to neighbor hotels added to the convenience. Room very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Lobby area clean and staff very helpful. We definitely will return soon with our boys.Thank you
10,I would not recommend this hotel. They have horrible customer service and pool wait times are horrendous. Called front desk three separate times and days and issue was never addressed. Pool wait times were up to 4+ hours on somedays.
20,They took my deposit. Said I ate and drunk out the bar when I didn't. I went too the machine and spent $3 a piece on Gatorade and drinks. I took pics of the fridge when I got there and afterwards. When I checked out.i was told I were charged for things. I told them I didn't take anything and I had pics of how it was when I got there. He said I didn't have to show and my money should be back on my card when I make it home
10,Slow service trash bags littered hall way broke ice maker dirty bathroom floor poor customer service. Several shops stores customer service close early short staffed table games limit three per table not enough tables open. Very disheartening.... don’t think I’ll be going back for a while....at least not to Mandalay Bay
50,My sixteen year old son and I stayed a week to celebrate my remission from cancer. Our room was on the 26th floor with a view of the pool and airport. Room was very comfortable with great beds tub in the bathroom and was clean.    Cons: Digital key app does not work in the elevators but will be great when that is fixed. Hallways smelled like weed most of the time. This seems to be a Vegas-wide problem so I’m not sure what the solution is. Only other con is the pool line takes like an hour.    Would definitely stay again!
20,We stayed here with the sole purpose of being able to visit the pool and enjoying the gaming. We intended on never leaving the hotel. Couldn’t get into the pool any day that we were there. There were also a lot of kids there and this was definitely taking up a lot of space. They need to come up with a better plan to allow guests the chance to visit the pool. We had to leave and go to a different property. Will never return.
40,I thoroughly enjoyed my complimentary suite! It was spacious and clean. The view was amazing... I can say I was disappointed at the amount of children throughout the casino... It made my gambling experience not as pleasant as before... Kids do NOT belong on the casino floor near machines...
10,I was so EXCITED to stay here but that quickly faded. First I do understand it's COVID and there are restrictions however this hotel is a complete mess. Good luck getting a reservation for any kind of meal - half of the restaurants are closed and the hours are hit or miss. Even Starbucks is iffy. I was there Monday through Friday and was able to get a drink Monday night but couldn't seem to find an open Starbucks the rest of the week no matter what day or time I went. Some of the restaurants and bars never opened. In comparison other Casino/Hotels that had their bars and restaurants open the entire time but with limited capacity. Now let's talk about the pool which opened from 930-6pm. If you didn't get in line at 7am you didn't get in. You then needed to get on a waitlist - which was also a joke because you had to try to find one of their people walking around to scan a QR code to get on the waitlist - then you would get a text (randomly hours later) giving you 30 minutes to get to the pool with your room key in order to get in - which had no available chairs the lazy river had no tubes but you could buy them and inflate them yourself with an air tube - but only if you also brought either payment or your ID because you cannot charge anything to your room without your ID (even though you can charge a $100+ meal to your room at the casino without an ID) you can then wait in line at the lazy river to enter again no drinks or food without that ID (which you take the chance of being lost or stolen while you are in the water (then good luck boarding your plane ride home - and there is no sign to tell you this or anyone else to tell you you need this and there is no reentry one you enter the pool). On top of all of this they have the nerve to charge you a resort fee per day - really for what? I will never return to this hotel again. I would discourage anyone from staying here. There is nothing that makes this place worth it - location sucks as it is far away from everything else and as you can see there is no other reason to stay here. On top of all of that the WiFi works about 50% of the time - so not great for a business trip when I'm trying to get work done (and I'm also in an online class so that was impossible to post any work) as well as losing my TV channels 25% of the time. I really can't think of many positives about this place.
50,This hotel is great because the pools and very clean and the pool staff was so great. The best part of our trip was hanging out at the pool drinking our specialty drinks. Would definitely stay here again.
20,Unfortunately everything was closed with availability of meals even limited. Getting into the pool area even to look was impossible the whole reason we booked this hotel was particularly for pool area which I literally never got to even sneak a peak due to volume capacity even at opening. The line of people to get in was nearly a half mile long and we just wanted to even just see what it looked like but unfortunately could not even be granted that. A pure disappointment to say the least we will never recommend this hotel to anyone and will discourage for anyone to book here.
30,Dust everywhere in the room. Principal mirror of the entrance was dusty.  Nobody told us about of reservation for the pool I stayed there especially for it.  Players card service assistant was very friendly.
30,Our room was dirty. Like it was quickly cleaned but they didn’t care very much. Hair all over the shower and bathroom floors. Hair clumps in the sheets. The windows were dirty. It was just about impossible to get into the pool. If you got on the waitlist at 9:30am you were lucky to get in by 3:30pm.
20,I have been waiting to stay at Mandalay Bay for years and finally got the chance to! Sadly it was not what I expected. I was looking forward to spending more time at the pool but unfortunately that wasn't in the cards with the long wait time. There are plenty of reviews about the pool so I will skip that. My biggest complaint was that the hotel did not feel very safe with COVID happening. SO many people walking around without masks even in packed elevators. They have security guards with masks to hand out yet they were whole families and parties with no masks walking right past the security guards and they were too busy on their phones to say anything to them. When we went to other nearby hotels it was not an issue at all there so it seems that Mandalay Bay is really the exception here.    The room was spacious and the bed was really comfortable. The AC did not work that well and the windows were VERY dirty. The shower handles were very strange and hot water wasn't great coming out of the shower. The bathtub and bed were the best part of the room.    One of the evenings we stayed the elevator on our floor did not work so we just stayed in the for the night after we got all dressed up to go gamble and drink. We did not feel confident that the hotel would fix it in a timely manner and didn't want to risk walking up 26 floors. Speaking of walking be prepared to walk very far from your car to the rooms if you are driving. The parking garage is clear across the hotel from the elevators to the rooms which wasn't too much of an issue for us but I could see this causing issues for folks with limited mobility or easily tired.    Overall we booked this hotel to give my fiance his first trip to Vegas and to celebrate our new engagement. Unfortunately Mandalay Bay completely missed the mark on giving us a good experience and I doubt we would stay here again.
10,The hotel floors smelled like an active Cheech & Chong movie. The lines for the restaurants are extremely long and the shops and underwhelming. You can use the digital key but you have to find the kiosk (which wasn’t clearly marked) to print the key in order to use it in the elevator. Attempting to find people to help or employees to direct where to go and for where were few and far between. Since COVID has been around it seems people have used this and the push for technology to skimp and place no importance or value on actual customer service or having a human being available to assist. I found the food and all the amenities within the hotel extremely over priced and I wish I would have stayed somewhere else. The walls are paper thin and you can hear EVERYTHING to include all the drunk stumbling people walking up and down the halls.
30,I wouldn’t recommend staying here with friends. If you are coming for a family vacation this hotel is suitable but for partying and coming with friends I wouldn’t recommend. Anybody can basically charge anything to your room. I never was refunded for a soda I never charged to my room although they said I would be refunded. $10 for that soda btw.
10,The options you have that pay for via amenity fee are extremely minimal if not unavailable!! You must wake up at 6am and sit in line until the pool opens at 9am in order to have a chance to get into the pool area.... not even in the water!! Harley any places to dine either.
40,The resort is a beautiful hotel. The rooms are spacious with a deep bath and separate shower. You can request an extra refridge so that you can keep your personal items cold. The casino was great. Some of the restaurants were open and very good.
50,Property was beautiful. The casino had a lot of space so it didn't feel crowded. Rooms were comfortable. Toilet room needs better ventilation. Tram runs from here to Excalibur so it saves a lot of walking!!
40,Hotel was clean and staff was friendly and helpful. Only downfall was accessing the pools. You had to be up and at the pool line at 6am to get a spot for the pool. Overall trip was great. Will definitely return!
10,Well if you want to use the pool you need to be in a line outside at 6am. The pool doesn’t even open until 9am. Otherwise you may be lucky enough to get on the wait list and be called 3-4 hours later. But since there is no set time you can’t do much else with your time because you’re on standby for the pool. There is no valet so you have to park yourself and walked all the way across the casino to the room elevators each time you’d like to use your vehicle. My bathroom floor and tub were in very dire need of a mopping and scrubbing. There are no lounges open to sit and have a drink late night.
10,I’m sorry to say but the pool situation is Ridiculous. It you could stand in line for hours and not get in the pool area at all. My wire would get in line at 5:45am any morning to ensure that my grandson had the opportunity to get in the pool at 9:00am.    This could all be avoided if they offered wristbands for three hours lights at check-in 9:00am to noon noon to 3:00and 3:00 to 6:00pm.
10,I was a guest at Mandalay Bay April 1 – 6 2021. I was there for a family wedding and stayed in a one bedroom penthouse sky view suite. The suite was nice and very spacious and comfortable. I also appreciated the little pouches of masks and hand sanitizer.    The safe did not work. I had to wait in my room for quite a while for the first tech to show up. He could not fix it and so we had to wait for another person to come to complete the job. They were both very friendly and apologetic but the process did hold us up.    There were no slippers as indicated by Andrea Montano in an email prior to my arrival: Robes and slippers are available in every room and you can request more if needed as well as turndown service for no extra price.    I called housekeeping and they were brought to my room.    Ms. Montano also told me that there was not a personal refrigerator in the suite: Please note that stocked mini-bars are provided but all items are on sensors and your account will be automatically charged upon removal. Empty mini refrigerators are available upon request at check-in (based on availability) for $40/night. Keurig coffeemakers are available in the rooms with a charge of $4 per disposable coffee kit. Complementary mini fridges (no freezers) will be provided to our guests for medical reasons only. These can be requested upon check in as well.    I brought a cooler with me as we had other wedding guests visiting in the suite however there was in fact a personal refrigerator in the suite. Had I known this I would not have taken the trouble to bring the cooler.    The lights went out in the bathroom. I called Guest Services and they instructed me as to how to reset the fuse. This happened to me twice.    The light on the make-up mirror in the bathroom did not work.    The TV in the wet bar area did not work.    There was no tablet and pen in the room so I had to go buy an overpriced pen.    We couldn’t get into the pool area as it was full every time we tried.    I inquired in advance about turndown service. Ms. Montano replied: Robes and slippers are available in every room and you can request more if needed as well as turndown service for no extra price.    The first night I called Housekeeping and Guest Services multiple times to request turndown and was put on hold each time. The second night I called earlier and was able to submit my request (approx.. 3:40 p.m.) . It took a total of three calls and the maid showed up at 9:25 p.m. She did nothing. Did not even turn down the bed. The fourth night I made the same request and the maid that came simply turned on the aquarium channel in the living room and bedroom. She did not turn down the bed.  When I stay at Aria turndown consists of turning down the bed filling the ice bucket putting slippers next to the bed replenish shampoo etc. putting water and chocolates on the nightstand. I was confused that turndown service at Mandalay Bay seems to consist of nothing.  I received one vanity kit the first day which consisted of one face pad and a few q-tips. I hope no one expected that this would last me 6 days.    There was a child screaming and shouting in the next room sometimes beginning at 3:30 a.m. This child was not crying. It was throwing full blown temper tantrums. After a couple of days I lost my patience and attempted to call Guest Services multiple times but never got through.  Despite the beautiful suite my experience was not enjoyable and I don’t plan to return.
40,We got a room looking over a roof and they changed us without much problem to a view of the pool. Thanks Mandalay bay!!    We were excited for the pool. Here is the scoop.  People line up early. I'm not sure how early. We arrived 45 min early and there were around 700 people ahead of us. Some were sleeping on towels. I know!!! Crazy.    The pool had a wait list app that you can scan at the top of the stairs leading to the pool. When you get on it they will text you and give you 30 minutes to get there.    The list starts when the pool is at capacity.  One day we waited 30 minutes. One day we waited 5 hours. By waited I mean we went and did other stuff.    So the day we got in early the pool water is freezing. Like terrible. On day 2 everyone voted to swim in the afternoon because of this.    The lazy river had a 30 minute line too.    Food at the pool is crazy expensive. We snuck our own in (sorry !!)    You can bring your own tubes for the lazy river. In years past they made you buy (not rent) their tunes.    The casino and hotel are at about 20% capacity. Which makes you wonder why is the pool so full?  The luxor guests use it. Delano hotel guests use it.....still.....at its reduced capacity it is extremely full. I was actually sort of glad they limit occupancy.
20,If you are coming to use the pool plan on getting up by 630 -7 to get in line for 2 hours... to wait to open then stand in line again to be let in- only at 50% capacity now can’t imagine what -100 looks like
10,"1st time at Mandalay and it was horrible. Checked in at noon placed on 4 HOUR waiting list for pool. We waited by going to shark exhibit - $82 for 3 people and it took us 15 mins to get through ""14"" aquariums which several were connected so it was more like 9 or 10 exhibits. Lunch was 3 slices of cheese pizza 1 beer and 1 Gatorade $42. We finally get our pool text that we are allowed to get in at 4:35pm in which we have to be prepared to drop everything change clothes and all of our party must be present at pool within 30 mins. So we waited over 4 hours to get in a pool that we were held on hostage standby yet by the time you get down there its nearly 5pm and OH YEAH THEY CLOSE AT 6PM!!!! So my son had 1 hour at the pool which turned out to be enough since it smelled of raw sewage in the lazy river. There was debris floating everywhere dirty towels all over the place trash not cleaned up just disgusting."
20,The hotel is beautiful however the service right now is not good. You have to wait in line hours before the pool opens at 9am to attempt to get a spot. Families were lining up as early as 5am to get waitlisted. I lined up waited then was placed on a waitlist for another 3 hours. Most restaurants inside the hotel are closed. The housekeeping staff is overwhelmed one day the trash and towels say in the hallway for hours after the housekeepers sat them out in the halls after they cleaned the rooms. My 3rd stay and the worst
40,Hotel was clean and covid-19 prec are carefully executed. However the pool entry was an issue. I waited 4 hrs to get in another day their waitlist was closed by 10:00am not a good thing when you want to enjoy a day at the pool. My room needed light bulbs change i requested 3 times nobody came to replace them. This have nothing to do with the hotel but i have to wake-up everyday during my stay to the smell for marijuana smh. The smell in the hallway was disgusting in the mornings because of that. Maybe a lil monitoring will be excellent. Aside from that i was ok with my stay at Mandalay Bay.
20,The resort is still closed basically. Hardly any restaurants are open compared to the other casinos we visited. If your going be prepared to get to the pool at like 7am cause you won’t get in. We we were disappointed in the restaurants not being open.
10,We were so excited to stay here! Traveling with two teenagers stayed for 5 days solely for the swimming pools we couldn’t get in even once. Spoke to a hotel representative and he told me “that is not true you can get in the pool if you get in line at 6 AM”. Are you kidding me?? We met several people that waited in line for over 2 hours and still didn’t get in. Had I known in advance we would have booked a more centrally located hotel on the strip for half the price with a pool we could use.  Room was nice/clean but no at towels at check in.  Casino under staffed not enough table games open dirty ash trays on slot machines. Although the dealers and employees they did have were very nice.  Extremely long lines at restaurants/food court and all closed early. Ate at Citizen on the last day. Waited so long on a missing item everyone else had finished their meal rest of that meal was cold. They offered a $7.00 credit on over a $100.00 lunch.  Extremely long wait on Uber/Lyft. Again if we had known we could not use the swimming pools we would have stayed at a different location where we didn’t need an Uber to leave this side of the strip every day.  Save your money and book somewhere else.
30,The hotel itself was absolutely perfect its just alot of walking from the parking garage to the elevator and then to your room. The hotel feels very safe you have to have a room to get on the elevator.
30,Terrible food court! The only place open late was SUBWAY which took forever! Not staffed properly and had to wait nearly 40 minutes JUST to order!! Horrible! I wish we would’ve stayed elsewhere because of this.
10,This was our wedding trip & honeymoon! From rude employees dated rooms. Restaurants closed resort fees being charged for a resort you can’t even access. Outrageous prices for food. To waiting 40 people deep in line at a Starbucks( there are 3 property) only 1 open. 4 to 6 hour wait to possibly go to beach area. Elevators were broke in our section had to use a service elevator which made room even further. Guest services ha ha atleast 20 to 30 minutes to get help on phone. Then was charged for a pepsi & other drinks we don’t even drink this crap. Just all around bad experience here. Will stay someplace a hell of alot better next time!
50,Literally didn’t need to leave the hotel for anything. Food & entertainment for the whole family. The staff were perfect. Great food and very clean all over. Only issue was the waiting list for the pool really didn’t have a limit on how long families could be in so others could get in
10,I should’ve listen to the reviews as the strip is very disappointing. Ping the daily charge for amenities yet none are offered to me as we cannot get into the pool all week. Unless you like to gamble and pay $30 for an omelette go somewhere else. I’m life hotels are great but I will never stay at Mandalay Bay again.
10,my husband and I flew here from South Carolina to meet up with my daughter and two grandchildren from Washington state. The reason we chose this hotel was because the pools were the drawing power for our vacation. We could not get into the pool until 4:30 in the afternoon because of the maximum capacity. The pools closed at six with no extension on that time. We had to get on the waitlist each day and were not guaranteed any pool time. The resort fee is astronomical for not being able to use the resort! our room was cared for nicely however my daughters room across the hall didn't get cleaned for two days. we understand that Las Vegas has had a horrible year but you would expect because of that horrible year Las Vegas would be doing everything in their power to lure people back in. With the customer service of our hotel Mandalay Bay I would not recommend anyone come to Las Vegas right now. The place is still closed down and it is impossible to get a reservation to a restaurant or get into a pool. Don't come with your kids. Or if you do Decide to come to Las Vegas for a family vacation go to Circus Circus which is totally geared towards kids and a blast. We paid good money to go have fun there as there was nothing at Mandalay Bay. What a total disappointment and we will never come here again
40,I have no complaints. Hotel room was cleaned daily and Guest services was prompt. Mask were wore in the hotel casino and pool. I do think a new plan is needed for the pool because a line formed at 7am and wrapped around the pool areas. Rent a chair day bed if you can. To guarantee entry.
20,Booked this hotel for the family trip because of the pool facilities. Not able to get into pool without waking up at 5AM and sitting on the ground outside until it opened at 9AM.  Tried booking cabana or chairs but they were sold out.    Price of food/drinks absurd!    Not the level of service or amenities you’d expect staying at a resort.
20,We checked in on a Monday and had to get on a 4 hour waitlist to enjoy the pool amenities for an hour and a half. The pools was the reason why we chose this hotel. Second day we explored the city in the morning came back in the early afternoon to go to the pools and were told they were at capacity and we could not get on a waitlist due to the waitlist being full as well. Third day we woke up early and got down there right when the pool opened stood in a massive Covid super spreader line for 1 hour only to be told the pool was at capacity and to get on a waitlist. They send you a text when they will allow you in and you only have 15 minutes to get down there or they give your spot away effectively making you a hostage in your room so you don’t miss your pool time. It is highway robbery to charge “resort fees” of $40 a day when you are denied access to the resort amenities you are being charged for. We asked if they could waive the resort fees for the day that we couldn’t get into the pool or at least do something to make up for it and were told we had to pay the fees regardless if they provided us access to the pool. Nothing else was offered. Terrible customer service. Will we not be staying here again.
20,The rooms are unclean and find garbage on the floor; hairs stick on the wall of shower room. Very noisy at night because of abnormal compressor; take over two hours to wait fir the pool. It is terrible and ridiculous for 4 star hotel.
10,"Came with my family to have a fun relaxing ""resort"" experience and was very very disappointed. I dont recommend anyone come in the near future good luck even getting in to the pool area the line to even get on the list which you need to be there at the crack of dawn is a few hours just to get on the list otherwise it's no use coming later to try and get in the pool its ridiculous the hotel needs to do something about this for the guests atleast!"
10,I have stayed at Mandalay Bay twice in the last three weeks. I will never stay at this hotel again. I don't have high standards and petty things don't bother me like some other posts but I felt like I needed to write a review. I recently checked in on Wednesday and was informed the room I reserved (2 Queen) is unavailable because the hotel was oversold. So I was offered a Roll Away bed - unacceptable for the two of us. That was only the beginning. The television in the room worked half of the time. Channels would just go black and I would get an error message. They might come back on hours later. I had maintenance to the room but it took them 4 hours to get there and by that time the channels were working again. So he couldn't help me. That evening television wasn't working again. We had the same issue in a different room the week before. The room has a fridge but it is stocked with way overpriced drinks and snacks ($10 for a Pepsi can). So the fridge was useless and we had medication that needed refrigeration. The day we checked in - I went to the M-Life counter and got my voucher for buy 1 get 1 free vouchers for the Shark Reef. We went down the the Shark Reef and was informed they were sold out for the next 3 days. They only allow 2 comp tickets every half hour. So we wasted our time and were not able to visit. The worst part of our trip (besides losing a bunch of money) was the pool/beach. The pool was open from 9:30-6:00. We went down to the pool around 11 am and was told the pools were at full capacity and we needed to join the virtual line. We went back to the pool around 2pm hoping to get in for an hour before we had to leave for our dinner reservations. The employee at the pool said they were still letting people in that checked in at 9:30am. Ummm what??? So apparently if you weren't in line by 8am there's a good chance you might not get into the pool for the day. We finally got a text saying we could enter the pool at 4:45pm. The pool closes at 6 and it's not like you can get to the pool in 5 minutes. We had already started getting ready for dinner and never got a chance to enjoy the pool - which is the only reason we booked this hotel. Very disappointing...  We also stayed at Planet Hollywood during this trip and we had no issues and it seemed like middle of the strip seems to be more of the happening place to be. Mandalay only had a handful of tables open whereas Flamingo Harrahs Paris and Planet Hollywood seemed to have all of their table games operational. One last issue was how long it takes to get cab. There seems to be a shortage of cabs because there are no Uber or Lyft drivers working (they are making more on unemployment). So the cab line is really long and cabs are scarce. Overall very disappointing stay and like I stated before - I will never stay at this hotel again. There are too many other hotels in a much better location on the Strip.
20,Went above and beyond trying to help us with the pool and making our family vacation a success! 💯 of the reason staying at the resort was for your pool and our kids to have blast at your pools finding out going to the pool was a challenge killed the whole experience!
20,I booked via the website and then found a better deal on Last Minute Travel and the hotel would not match the rate. Definitely check third party rates as they are often lower and do not trust that the hotel will match it. Their policy says they will plus 10 percent but they actually won’t. Super disappointing. We haven’t even stayed yet and I have a bad taste in my mouth. We usually stay at the Wynn/Encore or Cosmo and will probably not return here just from this experience.
30,They encourage to use app but app not helpful when my room was not ready. Check in is at 4pm and I was checking in at 5:30 and room still not ready. Hotel is far from strip and the tram was N/A bc of covid. SO be prepared to walk. Positive hotel is very clean and quiet.
10,"Had the worst hotel experience of our lives last week... it was as if it was a bad soft opening at a brand new hotel - clogged sink when we checked in and never got anyone to service house cleaner ran out of towels and took old ones so had nothing but a couple hands towels for showering 2 of the days (eventually found house cleaner in hall with towels but she wouldn't give us any because she ""needed them"" for her rooms) TV stopped working mid-trip and ""at your service"" never picked up regardless of what time we called. And to top it all off we came for the pool but never got in despite waiting in line AND doing the virtual ""wait list"" every day. I'm sure it's tough ramping up for an onslaught of spring break guests during covid but level of service should still be better than this?"
10,So we stayed at this hotel for five days. Not only did the elevators break and myself and my best friend who are both pregnant “seven months pregnant” we are required to walk down 22 flights of stairs in order to make our dinner reservations But the staff seemed extremely irritated that they had to answer questions about the situation.    During our five days stay we were unable to get into the free pool due to a two hour line that you had to stand in just to get on a waitlist to see if you can get in the pool that day. The hotel price gouges on the adult only pool They require you to rent a cabana or daybed which is $400-$650 for the low end adults only pool. The high-end adults only pool was $1200 and up for a day. Absolutely ridiculous.    Another issue we had is again being pregnant I need an extra pillow for the bed I called down and ask for an extra pillow and they told me that there were no extra pillows in the entire resort and that I would not be able to receive one.    I have never had this bad of an experience at a hotel before and I guarantee we will not be returning.
40,Many things are a challenge during the pandemic. Shark Experience sold out every day we were there. Waited in line for the pool for 45 minutes only to be put on a wait-list for another 90 minute wait. Need to research & plan ahead.
10,We were there with our family and said most everything was open when I was booking the stay but that was not the case. We stayed at this property specifically because of the pool for my kids to swim but what they don't tell you is you need be there at 6:00 am to get in line to get in by 9:00. We weren't able to swim even once due to the long lines and hours of wait time but they didn't mention that at all when I booked or when I inquired about it at check-in. Plus everyone on the casino floor seemed bothered if you needed something. Worst service I ever experienced in Vegas and I've been there at least 20 times.
40,We had a great time. Getting into the pool was pretty frustrating every day but overall we had a great time. Also a lot of the restaurants were still closed which was a little disappointing. Try the Border Grill by the Convention Center. It’s delicious!
40,Very nice hotel with a great pool. The location was fairly good for getting around to the other MGM hotels near by. The food in the restaurants was good but way overpriced. The one thing we disliked about Mandalay Bay was that the food court wasn't in a convenient location it was far away from main casino and hotel rooms.
40,Good - pool park / decor / cleanliness / exclusive family atmosphere / quiet    Bad - food selection / food price / pool prices on everything / location on strip    My 4 yo had a great time at the water park so that made the trip but probably will return to the four corners on the next vegas vacation
30,The wait for the pool was at least three hours unless you got in line an hour before the pool opened. There were not any seats available in the pool area even though it was at limited capacity. The toilet in my room was leaking and it took maintenance several days to fix the issue. I notified the front desk staff three days in a row before it was fixed. The entire bank of elevators serving floors 16-30 went out requiring long waits to get on the service elevators. The restaurants required very long waits for seating and service. I have stayed at Mandalay Bay several times over the years and was never disappointed but this stay has me reconsidering ever staying there again.
20,Bathroom was dirty hard to find service from staff can’t use fridge in room dining options/venues were closed or wait lines were outrageous. I paid a Resort fee for a resort I didn’t get to use. It was also very difficult to navigate with no maps direction. It really just seemed like a Zoo in there with no form of direction.
10,Do NOT stay here until they have a better system for the pool. You cannot get into the pool unless you like up at 6:30 am. This is such a disappointment for families who booked their spring break with their kids to use the pool here to swim.
40,But this time around I was disappointed. All I wanted to do was sit my the pool w a drink my  Hands only to be told it was at capacity by 9am and that Sunday was already sold out. Hopefully a better system can be put in to play.
10,This is a first for us. We’ve never felt necessary to leave a negative review after staying in Vegas but after this trip we felt it was needed. Hopefully others won’t fall into the trap of booking here. We’ve stayed all over the strip and decided to book MB after speaking to them before booking regarding access to their activities on site. Once we checked in though it was a completely different story. The pools and clubs were closed or impossible to access. Staff and management were rude and condescending to guests (poor family in front of us in line flew here just for their kids to play in the wave pool and after 5 days they never got to even see it). Rooms were dirty overcrowded lobby guests openly smoking weed in the casino and common areas without worry from security long lines to restaurants and price gouging in the rooms for coffee and snacks. Spoke with some guests at other resorts down the strip that had completely different experience last at the resorts they were staying at. Clearly a lot of others shared our experiences as we read the reviews prior to adding ours. This is no joke or “being a Karen”. It’s really as bad as what we all experienced.
40,Nice place.Good food at restaurants but room service food was cold. Pool fees were high and pool was very crowded even with limited attendance. Hours too short pool should have been opened longer. Tram was running off and on which was a bummer. Shops were ok.
10,Room was in disrepair and hotel staff non existent. Check in line was 2 hours long. Room ac broken sinks clogged no amenities open. But still charging that resort fee. Fully booked the hotel but don’t have the staff to cover it.
50,Me and my girls spent 5 wonderful days at Mandalay Bay.Due to Covid a few restrictions were in place that made the wait time longer than usual. Luckily we reserved Shark reef before we arrive as well as a few other attractions. The wait for the pool was very long but we had the opportunity to go to Daylight Beach club which was awesome. The staff was very friendly. Overall this was a great trip and the hotel compensated for any inconveniences.
10,Given a dirty room down graded to a king so our kids had to stay with a friend in our second room then the TV malfunctioned so nothing to watch when in the room. 20 minute wait for guest services and 5 hour wait for the pool. Do not stay here.
50,It's always a pleasure to visit Mandalay Bay. We love the shopping and restaurant options even if the hours are very limited due to COVID. We always come back here because of the wave pool and lazy river. The pool area was very organized and well staffed even if the wait time is long. The staff are always courteous professional and friendly. We always feel welcomed and appreciated. We can't wait to come back.
20,We rented a media suite the TV in media room never functioned properly movies were buffering. Guest toilet wouldn’t flush One of the three A/C units was humming loudly one of the 5 pre packaged coffee cups was opened and used then placed back on the rack without room attendant noticing. Light bulb was out in Master bath above mirror. When discussed with hotel Representative upon check out it truly seemed as if she didn’t care :-(
50,Something about all that gold in the desert really pops. Resort was very clean and the food was amazing. Room was big beautiful and the bathroom was no exception. Would definitely come back for another trip soon. Try the Border Grill Tara was awesome
30,Need cleaning staff to be more accommodating and speak English please. I checked in on my mobile and that was great. Requested for extra towels on my check in but didn't get any. Spotted a cleaning lady across my room and asked for towels she said sorry I don't clean your room. Not sure if she understood me since she is chatting with somebody in Spanish. Ice machine was broken and room service staff said they will send us ice 15-30 minutes. Never happened.
10,Just know with Covid there are massive restrictions to the use of pool but none on room capacity. So you can have a full hotel but only 50% capacity at pool. Ridiculous. Staff was rude. Made a request to 5 different staff and it never happened. They “fake type” into your room notes.
20,Getting into the pool is a debacle. It was the primary reason for the stay at this hotel over others. For what you pay for a room you barely get your values worth due to limited entry and some serious flaws to get early entry.  The pool is nice but the hurdles to get in weren’t worth the hassle.
10,Bad customer service dirty rooms restrooms not working properly and super slippery floors (my daughter had a concussion due to a fall) I honestly saw a lot of people making complains. Check in was a long process. Pool wait was 4-5hrs. Pool managers are horrible.If you want to have a great time do not stay here. I have never written a review here BUT I feel it’s necessary to speak the truth and avoid someone else a bad vacation.
20,Wait for the pool was hours long. If you’re planning on using the pool and don’t want to get up at 6:30 to get in line for the 9am opening wait until COVID is over.    The casino folks were awesome but that didn’t make up for the poor handling of the limited pool capacity.
50,Great time. Nice rooms. Clean. Friendly staff. Awesome vibe. Definitely plan on returning. Recommend this hotel. Checked in online which sped up the process. It's nice to getaway and be in a nice relaxing hotel.
20,Staff need to inform the guess what to do in case the elevator is not working. Give alternative way to go in their prospective room. We never get informed. We just use the stairs going down. My kids are hungry
20,I was unable to use the pool I was put on a waiting list and never called back.  Second day we had to line up by 6:30 am to be able to get in at 9:00 when they open.  Instead of coming here to relax as expected it was a hassle for me and my family.  The Managers at the pool were very rude and unable to handle the situation they created due to the lack of organization
10,We paid for early check in at 10:00 but were refused at time of arrival. We then left our bags at the bell desk and went to the pool but were refused access due to limited occupancy. Waited in the lobby for 4 hours. All the restaurants and shark reef exhibit were completely booked so there was nothing to do during our stay. Staff  seemed over worked. Completely worthless on all levels.
30,Not what you expect Nice hotel or somehow you walk around asking other guess where things are and what time restaurants are open Forget about the pool it was overbooked we didn’t even get to get in three days that we were stayed
30,Didn't explain that there was a security fee that caused financial problems and I still haven't been reimbursed. Also there was a broken shower handle. The location of the hotel is at the end of the strip so if you branch out there are alot of unsavory characters. But the bartenders were very polite.
50,We came for the pool. For covid restrictions you have to get there before it opens or you may not have a chance all day to get it. Most were kind about asking to wear a mask when not at the pool. One employee a boss woman wearing a suit jacket and skirt was snippy about asking us as i was drinking water... other than that the rest ask very politely and kindly.
30,First day there we tried to go to the pool which we were put on a waiting list after waiting 2 hours in line. Next day we woke up at 6 to get in line to wait till they open at 9. We were very happy to to be able to get in and very disappointed when all rental tubes were SOLD OUT. We went to lazy river just to swim without a tube which to our surprise we had to wait in another line to get in. Overall stay was very dissatisfaction. We got to our room and there were no trash bags in bins and no do not disturb sign which yes wasn’t a big deal but after waiting in line just to wait in another line to swim was very disappointing.
20,If you book this to use the pool plan on getting up early standing in line no later than 7 o’clock in hopes you make it in for a 9 o’clock opening. If you don’t you will need to find something to do for 3-4 hours. I’m not sure what the resort fee covered when the amenities weren’t available.
50,Clean room comfortable beds and spacious tub.    Be mindful that if you’re using the MGM Resorts app to use the bluetooth digital key it may not work when you get on the elevator but it will work when you’re at your room. Get your keys printed as a precaution.
30,I will not stay here again during the pandemic you're paying a resort fee for amenities you don't get to utilize and the elevators are not socially distanced and a few of them were malfunctioning. The rideshare location was not easily found. I normally love this pool but this location is not ideal
10,Rooms weren’t ready. Booked a double queen got a king with a springy roll away bed for the first night. Mold in shower. Advertising pool is open but you have to make reservations. We were there for 5 days 4 nights and my kids were only able to go to the pool one day and for 1 hour. Pathetic.
20,"Every year our family goes on an adult only vacation. This year due to Covid we had to stay in Country so what better place then Vegas! Our top priority was the pool. We did our research and landed on MB because of their beach pool and lazy river. Well we never got through the gates. Not once. It was ""at capacity"" the whole time we were there. If I could have cancelled the rest of my days at MB we all would have. We ended up going to the Luxor pool but I could have stayed home for that experience. MGMs pool was also ""at capacity"". Just know unless your willing to go line up at 5am you will not get to enjoy the MB pool. Rooms were nice and comfortable. Room keys on your phone are a great idea but real world use is another story. No matter what you did or needed there was a line. Long long lines. Coffee long line breakfast long line water long line the list goes on. You can make coffee in your room or drink a bottled water but that opens up your mini bar tab. I think that starts at $50. If you buy water or soda at a store and put it in your mini fridge $50 bucks. Lol... Oh and if you want room service so you dont have to stand in line for over an hour to be seated somewhere $100 minimum. So now you know before you go... Its a nice hotel and a good place if all you want to do is gamble."
20,Charged for every little detail huge lines unable to get in the pool unless you start standing in line at 7:00am no room in mini fridge- charged if you use the fridge far from the Strip you don’t get to use 7 pools- only 3- and only two of them are “pools”- very misleading.
10,Had the same experience as the recent comments. Called before booking and was assured no issues accessing the pool only to get here and being told there’s little to no chance of getting in the pool or pool clubs. We were offered a cabana at $720 a day though... Also was told they were going to open the buffet by the time of our visit to limited capacity. Checked in no buffet. Half the restaurants were closed and the ones that were open were under staffed and very expensive. Casino was half empty and never or heard the cheers and laughter of winning big. Overall just a terrible experience for a first time.
40,Do not open the refrigerator and do not drink the coffee! Although you may have a refrigerator in your room you are charged for every day you open it. It is NOT for your personal use. The front desk confirmed this once we got there. If you want coffee bring your own k-cups and coffee cups. You will be charged if you use what’s in the room. Luckily we discovered this on Trip Advisor before we left for our trip. If we had known before we booked our rooms we would’ve stayed somewhere else. The rooms were nice. The staff not overly friendly. A lot of the restaurants were closed. It’s been a few days and we still haven’t gotten a copy of our bill. That scares me a little. Aside from the resort fees be aware of the deposit. We stayed 5 nights and the deposit was more than the total cost of the room for those nights....outrageous! We still have no idea what they’ve charged us!!
20,The photos online look great. That’s about as far is it goes! The casino is nice. The rooms are decent. The view is awesome! If you are planning for a nice day at the pool or a great restaurant in the evening go somewhere else!! We waited in line for an hour before the pool opened (based on the suggestion from other guests). We were able to get in only to find that the only seats open were by a pool that was closed!
10,We stayed with another family in anticipation of using the wave pool. We bought tubes and got in line just after 10am. We were quoted a two hour wait snd told we would only have 15 mins to return when our resi was called so we stayed on the property. After two hours and not hearing anything we checked in again and were told they didn’t know when there would be avail. We didn’t get a reservation until 3:30pm 5 hours later. There were families staying there all day. When we complained we were brushed off and they claimed it was COVID’s fault. This was a management issue. Families should have been limited to two hours! We tried to go to the aquarium as a back up plan but that was also booked days in advanced. We had 6 disappointed bored kids. If we were quoted 5 hours from the get go then at least we could have left and had fun while waiting. The pool is a hot mess and was handled so poorly. Staff was rude and dismissive. We also tried to call security when the people next door were partying late but couldn’t get through to anyone on our phone so we had to get dressed snd walk down to the lobby. Will not be staying here again.
40,22 years after its grand opening Mandalay Bay remains a great resort. The only disappointing aspect was it was chilly out--a little too early in the season to make proper use of the beach and lazy river complex. It's a truly beautiful breathtaking hotel. Guests without cars should remember Mandalay Bay is at the far southern end of the Las Vegas Strip. All the action at the Strip and Tropicana Avenue is a bus/taxi ride tram ride or very long walk north. The tram between Mandalay Bay and Excalibur is currently closed for the virus.    Tourists considering Las Vegas should postpone their plans until Las Vegas is truly open for business. Very few shows are functioning. None of the trams on the Strip or the Las Vegas Monorail are operational. Masks are required everywhere indoors.
20,The Mandala Bay is still one of the more family friendly casino hotels in Vegas. But compared to when I stayed here many years ago the hotel is now very dated compared to the others and the rooms are still the same old room and haven't kept up with the times. One thing to keep in mind if you are booking a family with kids for the pool. They are limiting the people who can get in so either book a cabana weeks ahead or you have to line up before the pool opens to be able to get in.
50,Mandalay Bay has great restaurants. It is a resort you never have to leave. Covid as greatly changed the experience but during this trying time Mandalay Bay does quite well with the restrictions. A very nice stay!
20,This was our first time staying at the Mandalay Bay and we probably won't be back. The hotel is pretty but it was completely understaffed. Most of the restaurants aren't open and the lines at those that were open were very very long. We had to go off property to eat. Very long lines to get to the elevator to your room. The room had maintenance issues and it took many calls and a lot of time to get it resolved. Also had no towels at all in the room. You have to pay to use the little kurig machine in the room. You had to get in line to use the pool by 6:30 AM or you won't get in (pool doesn't even open until 9:00 AM). If you do get in there are no chairs available and a long line to get in the lazy river. We ended up leaving without even using the pool after a 3 hour wait because there was no place to sit. Very disappointing. They need a much better system. Since it was understaffed everyone who works there is cranky. And the guests are all cranky due to the lack of service. Not a great experience.
20,This hotel was understaffed and many of the restaurants were not opened causing huge lines at the ones that were open. There was a 2-3 hour line to get into the pool and no chairs available. We had maintenance problems with our room that took three calls and two visits to the front desk to resolve. This hotel is too expensive for this kind of hassle. Get your act together Mandalay Bay.
20,You must reserve a cabana to practically have pool access or wake up at 6 am to line up in a crazy line that doesn’t guarantee you access to the pool. You basically pay just to stay in the room but your access to the pools is not guaranteed.
20,The hotel looks very ambitious and fundamental. The hall and reception area is the best with stone-marble and expensive decorations. The hotel is very big and has own oceanarium conference hall and 3 swimming pool own casino and various restaurants also gum and spa. One big swimming pool was amazing with natural waves and sandy. I was settled on 56 floors with an awesome view of mountains and the airport. I saw how airplanes land off and land on-it was very romantic. The king-size bed was comfortable and cozy. The bathroom was very huge with a separate bath and shower.    · Despite the hotel looks impressive I don't like the service on this hotel. I would say- no service at this hotel and the owner need to think about all guests and improve their service. I celebrated my birthday and expected more. There no was no dishes and glasses in the room. The kettle has no vessel and we cant use them. I used my own garbage pocket because of the servent economy them. We stayed 5 days and sometimes the servant miss the clean. The gym was closed all time. I was wondering when the big swimming pool was closed all week and works only on the week-end. This was a reason why was a crowd in another small swimming pool and was a queue. there were no clear rules for wearing masks. the staff constantly approached and bothered to wear masks as some were without masks by the pool or who bought a weekly pavilion. It was very annoying. It was not resting but constant nerves. I lay with my wife apart from the people and we were constantly annoyed. I have a birthday but did not receive compliments or some little presents from the hotel.
30,The check in process was poor. The pool staff was not the best. One of the saving graces was the pool manager. Fortunately she intervened and was able to resolve the issue (the lifeguards were unfriendly towards my children).
10,We booked this hotel for the pool because we brought teens and thought we could spend time at the pool. Every morning there was a line to get in the pool. Pool was “at capacity“ by 10 or 11 o’clock and they opened at 9. The only time we got into the pool was by standing in line for two hours before it opened to be able to swim. Couldn’t even get a seat. I understand there are many things new and different because of Covid but they need to get a better system. Rooms are very noisy plenty of broken things in our room.(Iron TV kept saying this channel is unavailable so we had no TV noisy water pipes and couldn’t get the fridge opened) We asked for adjoining rooms when we made our reservations. People on the phone said that needs to be done in person at check-in. Well at check-in of course they told us opposite..that needed to be done when we booked the room. So of course we did not get our adjoining rooms.  Again because of Covid plenty of the restaurants were close so the ones that were open the lines were astronomically long. We ended up leaving the premises 99% of the time to find food elsewhere. We went mainly for the “beach entrance” pool. Take my advice and go somewhere else Were you can actually get into the pool.
30,Other than the resort grounds and our suite which were both amazing the rest were disappointing from the overpriced drinks at the pool ($32 miami vice which was horrible) and ($120 for 3 items and a bucket of water bottles at the poolside grill). Shopped at the market on site for room snacks $70 and went to Walgreens the next day and got the same things plus more for $34. Some restaurants closed for business. Virtual wait list for resturants and pool (getting a lounge chair at pool or getting on the lazy river was almost impossible). Hopefully when Covid restrictions loosen up.............some of this will change!
50,Mandalay is a gorgeous hotel. The rooms are Exceptional and nothing less than perfect. Beds are comfortable bathrooms and rooms spacious. Every amenity we needed.  However with covid the pool is at 50% capacity and people are getting up very early to stand in line. We were put on a waiting list and called back 4.5 hours later. We quickly ran back and changed in the bathroom so we couldn’t miss our time slot. But the unfun didn’t end there we all have serious chemical burns from the pool that worsened throughout the evening. Our kids were crying that evening as we applied hydrocortisone and cream to them. - and yes we bathed them after swimming with soap and water and this still happened. Photos included. Awful that they’re adding so much chemical/bleach to the water. Ugh.
10,Absolutely the most rude and disrespectful staff. Waited in line for over 2 hours to access pool and get on a waitlist. The text never came and I was told “sorry for the bad luck” unacceptable. Stayed for 3 days and never got to access the pool due to their faulty text system. I will never stay here again.
40,The wave pool was a super wait ruined my expectations. Would like to have had pool time it’s beautiful abs yet hotel is very nice very accommodating too my people during COVID unfortunately I appreciate credit so that I could go back and maybe not so busy next time
50,Beautiful rooms. Comfortable beds. Clean. Very pleasant staff. Accommodated us with a slightly late check out. Casino was fun and very clean. Overall great experience. I highly recommend it! You won’t regret it.
10,We rented a large suite at Mandalay Bay for 3 days to end a southwest vacation where we also saw the Grand Canyon and Sedona. The day we got there we were told we could not use the pools because they were full. No concessions were made even though we had rented a big suite had services planned in the spa and sitters booked to go out (read: we were spending a lot of money at the hotel and expected better treatment). Instead I had to get up at 7am to wait in line fit 2 hours to use the pool. When we talked to the manager they offered no solutions and were very rude and condescending.  Other issues:  The massage was mediocre at best.  There was never ice in any of the ice machines.  The room was fine thankfully - it was the only thing that was as expected.
10,This hotel is at the very end of the strip. Many restaurants and venues were closed. Wait times at restaurants that were open were usually very long. Our mini bar was full of expired items and half empty bottles. The pools were basically unusable unless you get there first thing in the morning. If you are going to stay here wait until things are more open and then book a different hotel
30,Great place for families. Rooms and bathrooms are nice and large. Closet space is more than adequate. Dresser drawer space is lacking. The pool and beach is nice but the rules for young/small children make it not family friendly. Poolside service is also very slow.
10,We had issues with check in  room service and staffs were not professional. The manager even showed the bad attitude to the customer. Can’t believe how could the hotel change that much . The worst thing is the pool was always fully booked and my boys never got change to play
10,We chose Mandalay Bay because of the wonderful pools they have which are literally impossible to get into it unless you’re willing to get up two hours before the pool opens and wait in line and then when you finally get a spot at the pool you’re not allowed to leave or if you leave you can be put on a five hour waiting list to get back in! You’re not allowed to use the mini fridge in your room for your own personal items like leftovers which is ridiculous and if you do they charge $50 $50 to use the refrigerator! There is no complementary coffee anywhere in the hotel which is pretty much standard in the United States Holiday Inn etc.! If you pick up a coffee cup in your room or move anything in the minibar you can charge for it! It is quite a distance off the strip! Our air conditioning in a room did not work very well they did come to try and fix it it was better but still subpar!
10,I had sheets on one of my beds and called upon arrival to get them changed. Was told they would be changed and they never were on Wednesday. Called 3 times on Wednesday and was told on the last call that no one was there to change the sheets. Unacceptable when I called 5 hours earlier initially and was told that it would be taken care of. Called first thing Thursday and said that the sheets would be taken care of first thing left room and returned around 3 and it still wasn’t changed 2 housekeepers stated they were about to take care of the room and they never did. Called again and still nothing. Called around 5am Friday morning to find out my requests were cancelled 😡. Ridiculous. Room finally got serviced on Friday unacceptable. I don’t care if my rooms were comp rooms I still deserve a good room and good service. Was told resort fees would be taken care of but 2 nights without sleeping comfortably or being able to enjoy my room is unacceptable. A manager never followed up to ensure if things were taken care of. This is the worst service I have received out of the several visits to Vegas
20,"Wait till restrictions are lifted. The pool area is restricted access and you have to actually go down to pool area and scan a QR code to get on a waiting list to MAYBE get in. It is so ridiculous that there would be a line of hundreds of people who got the approved text allowance at 6am waiting 3 hours for the gates to pool to open. Kids under 48"" not allowed in wave pool or lazy river."
30,Check in experience was not smooth. We had a reservation and were directed back and forth an overall 4 times between the four seasons Mandalay Bay and the Delano. In addition charging for a cup of coffee in the room is really really classless.
30,I stayed 4 nights at this resort to explore the Las Vegas area and see the sights. I can see the airport and the pool from my room. The room itself is very comfortable and large but there is no microwave the fridge is full of items to purchase (no room for leftovers) and I could hear the pipes from rooms around me. The resort is clean and comfortable. Being at the end of the Strip it is a walk to the other resorts. It's is also a walk to your car in the parking garage. The Starbucks opening at 6am is nice. I booked a Costco package with a free rental car so I was able to see the Hoover dam Summerlin and Henderson. My wife and I found several great restaurants a few blocks away. Overall it was a relaxing stay.
50,Over all stay was enjoyable. Would come again. It was extremely busy. But what can we expect it was spring break. Room was clean upon arrival. Make sure u add yourself to the wait list for pool as soon as possible. I think because of pandemic they were limiting amount that entered the pool. Was only able to swim one day out of the 4 days we stayed.
20,"Opened the minibar fridge but did not TOUCH anything. Got three $10 charges for using one $10 double coffee which isnt even IN the minibar fridge. They are on top of the counter so maybe ""technically"" they are considered part of the mini-bar. Just lucky we didnt get charged for the soap or toilet paper too since by their logic those might also be considered part of the mini-bar."
40,Very nice stay. The Covid rules had a big impact on the pool and bars. Mask had to be used at the pool. 50 % capacity at the pool. Staff seemed in short supply. Lines were long at Starbucks and the pools
10,when we checked in there were three they had 3 people checking in a line of about 60 people it took way too long. We also waited for two hours for toilet paper. Ridiculous. on the casino floor you cannot find a worker and the waitresses were a few far inbetween. All the restaurants closed very early. Needless to say we did all our purchases and food consumption outside of the hotel. not to mention the pool that was poorly staffed and you needed an appointment to go swimming did not make sense. we were there five days and didn’t get one chance to go swimming which was the whole purpose of staying at the Mandalay Bay. I wouldn’t recommend this place to my worst enemy will not be visiting any MGM grand resort hotels because if this is how they run this casino then I can’t imagine the other ones. Step your game up MGM because you’re definitely dropping the ball. and I don’t wanna hear any excuses about spring break or a Covid understaffing you should’ve been prepared.
20,Went for what was supposed to be a nice weekend at a resort. Pool opens at 9 lines start at 7am. By the time it opens at 9 it has already reached max Covid capacity. Waitlist. 6.5 hrs later text saying it’s your turn. By then the pool is almost closed and the sun is going down. No advanced warning when booking. No ability to schedule times so everyone can use the facility. Lack of transparency and disregard for the guest experience is astounding and a travesty to a reputation that was previously stellar. Also just a weird thing in the new COVID world. Talked to zero staff members the whole time I was there. Check in and out on the app. Scan everything for info. Super convenient and clean but once again detracts from the experience.
30,Be careful on this property! Pool is a nightmare getting anything from guest services takes hours. It was a 4 day vacation we got to go in the pool one time! I had to wait 3 hours before opening. Only cleaned our room one time. Had to call for clean towels snd toilet paper!
40,Check in was super easy on the app. The elevators always had a huge line. The room view was less than ideal. The libertine social restaurant was EXCELLENT. The room was clean and very nice. The fridge was well stocked.
10,Reserved a room with 2 queen beds and a room with 2 queen beds were not available at check-in. I HAD TO SLEEP ON A ROLL-A-WAY BED FOR 2 NIGHTS!!!    I tried to check in at midnight and there was a line of 50 people trying to check in with only 3 staff working the desk. Come on! Take care of the people who want to staff at your resort!!!
20,Reserved 5 nights 6 days at the Executive King stay well suite.    Mobile check in was ok. Digital keys don’t work well in the elevator. Long Lines. Hotel seems short staffed. So extra long wait times to call Guest services concierge or even bell desk.    Housekeeping didn’t clean well. I’ve stayed at Mandalay before and this time it’s worse. The soaking tub was dirty and had scum in the side.    The upgraded fee I paid for the room was not worth it cause simple wall outlets were loose. Bedside Lamp outlets were the same.    Asking for extra amenities .... it’s like an interrogation. Why ? Is it not in the room? How many of what ?    I was supposed to have the special vitamin c vial in the shower as part of the Stay well brand. That was missing. I let them know since the first day. Nothing happened. Someone came up next day to see and promised to fix it. Nothing. On the 5th day I called MLife to report they had front desk call and they sent engineer to fix. Engineer came to look and said parts are missing he will be back.    He came back to tell me they have no parts. He will note the account. He told me to key front desk know. I went there and they seemed confused why I am reporting this.    I asked to speak to a manager. He was too busy. I was told I will be given a free stay offer via email from a separate department. I’m still waiting for that email.
20,Service is terrible. No valet. Check in a nightmare. 1.5 hour in check in line. Mobile key check in didn’t work. Restaurants closed or only open until 7-8 at night. Pool basically inaccessible unless you want to get in line at 6:00am. Joke.
50,Returned to Vegas in years to visit my older sister that lives there. We decided to stay at Mandalay Bay because we always had a fun and problem free visit. I was impressed in the hotel’s procedures and made you feel very safe there. Although there were some venues closed you were still able to make a selection. I only see the hotel just getting more to their normal (high expectations) in the coming months.
30,Although the hotel itself was BEAUTIFUL. they have some of the most disgusting guests I’ve ever come in contact with !! It’s so unfortunate that i have to leave a review like this but i can’t express enough how disturbing it was for us to stay here
10,We have stayed at other MLife properties several times but Mandalay Bay was horrible!!  Several bad things happened...  1) Bad experience started with check-in taking over an hour and a half (mobile check-in wasn't working).  2) Then the illegal bait and switch occurred we were told that the room we booked was not available but for $50 more we could upgrade. After refusing to pay more money I was offered a King Bed with a roll away bed.  3) After waiting for over an hour for our bed to be delivered we called and were told they did NOT have any beds. (Not sure if they just expected my son to sleep on the floor). Finally they were able to 'magically locate' a bed once my husband demanded a room change.  4) In the morning we waited in line for the pool (we were told to be there at 9:00 when it opened we found out that people starting lining up at 6:30am) - after finally getting up to the check-in we were told it would be a 3 hour wait - it took over 4 hours to get in  -- I understand COVID restrictions but why charge resort fees if you can't use any amenities  5) OTHER Problems - 30 people deep lines to use the elevators (sometimes a 20 minute wait) - NO room service (we never had enough towels since we were given a king room with 3 people - called for more towels and they never came- we never had our room cleaned) - no refrigerators - paper thin walls - pot smell everywhere (even on our hotel floor) - not sure if our room had been cleaned before we entered we have pictures of huge stains on the duvet
50,This was our first time staying at this hotel and it was really nice. We loved the view and the tube. It was a really nice hotel. The pool was not a welcoming experience very chaotic. The tub in the room are very enjoyable options in lieu of the pool and hot tub being closed. The layout of the hotel can be a little confusing but once you get it can become a breeze.
40,Restaurant and some pool limitations were frustrating but overall a good experience. The smell of cannabis was EVERYWHERE indoors and at the pool. Not sure how to control this but such a turnoff for public.
30,Not as family friendly as they let on. My children couldn't even stand on the walkway off of the casino floor. I was told to leave them unattended if I wanted to play.. All the while there were three other children literally on the casino floor with their parents. My children felt as if they were specifically singled out. Wasted money on this trip to sit in a room unless we left to the other hotel/casinos. Very disappointing.
50,The hotel was very clean and nice I have stayed at newer hotels that didn't seem as nice. The one issue I had was slow elevators that stopped at every floor which newer systems do not do. I would recommend this hotel.
10,Ok so I booked two rooms for my kids my husband and I a total of 5. Usually we get connecting rooms. I checked in via mobile app which I thought would be faster. It was actually more of a hassle since it only lets you check In to only one room. I got an email before we arrived stating our room was ready which I thought was great because we arrived shortly after I received that email. I went to get my keys and that’s when I found out that I was only checked in to one room. When we got the second room it was on another floor. I politely asked if something could be done since I didn’t want my kids on the 5th floor when we were on the 8 th floor. They said the best they could do was get me a second room on the same floor but it would not be connected because they were sold out. Ok fine. Then she proceeds to tell me that o should feel lucky that I’m being allowed to check in early since check in isn’t until 3 and it was only 1. I told her I didn’t ask to check in early I was simply going by the email I got saying our room was ready. We get to our room and the keys don’t work so back down we go. When we finally get settled in we go down to relax by the pool only to find a crowd of people waiting to get in. The pool was full and we had to be put on a waitlist. The wait was 3 hours long. We didn’t get until 430 and the pool closed at 6. I was advised to get online the next morning around 8am to make sure I got a spot when the pool opened at 9. I got to the pool at 730 am and there were already hundreds of people in line. Thankfully we made it in but there were no chairs available for any of our things. We had to scramble with other guests to find chairs to put together. It was a chaotic stay for what was supposed to be a relaxing stay. I like this hotel. And I love their pools so good for kids. But it was just crazy.
50,Family friendly and clean. Rooms were spacious. Pool was amazing. Best on strip. Gas station across street has snacks for room at regular pricing. Walking distance to Las Vegas sign. Great views in any direction.
20,I am currently at the Mandalay Bay Las Vegas with my six year old daughter for spring break. We planned to spend our four day trip enjoying this location. However we have been unable to access the pool or aquarium.    We were told this morning that the pool reached capacity at 9:30 am. I joined the virtual waiting list and received confirmation at 9:34 am. It is now after 6 pm the pool is closed and we have not yet received a text to access the facility.    When we were notified that the pool was at capacity I attempted to purchase tickets to the aquarium today. The aquarium tickets were sold out yesterday when we arrived so I tried today. They are also sold out for today Friday and Saturday.    Had I known in advance that we would not be able to enjoy the facilities at this resort we would have stayed mid-strip which is where we have had to spend the last two days anyway. I did not bring my daughter on vacation to have to tell her “no” to everything that she wants to do here. What exactly do the resort fees cover when you cannot enjoy the resort?    Update: Friday 4:39 pm. Joined the pool waitlist this morning at 10 am. Still no text. Headed home tomorrow. Highly disappointed.
40,Beautiful property and well maintained. Great mobile app/digital key experience. What’s not great is if you ever need anything for the room (like enough towels for the number of guests on your reservation) good luck getting anyone to ever answer your calls.
20,We've stayed Mandalay a number of times over the past 20 years and have always enjoyed it. Not this time. The hotel was so totally unstaffed and overbooked it over-shadowed the entire experience. If you want to use the pool book a cabana now. Fortunately we knew this ahead of time and did so. Lazy river? IF you even get in to the pool its a 35-40 minute wait.    The staff tried so hard to do their best but they were totally overwhelmed. We waited 3 hours for the bedding to make up the sofa bed.    So disappointed. Not sure we will go back.
10,Worst resort in vegas! We tried for 2 days to get into the pool and it was at capacity by 9:15 am. They have a wait list with a 4 hour wait only to get a text saying sorry not today. No restaurants or bars open..even starbucks is closed by 2. The rooms are dirty and mobile check in is a joke. Room was not ready even at 4 pm. Housekeeping ran out of clean towels and upon arrival we had 5 policemen get in our elevator gloved up heading to the floor before ours. Want a drink in the casino? Be prepared to pay $20 for a cocktail and to top it all off the WIFI was down.
10,From check in to issues to the room to cold room service this was a terrible experience. It was almost impossible to get anyone on the phone. Woke me up at 2 am banging on my door to fix the broken tv
10,We visit Mandalay Bay around 4 times per year for staycations and this visit was by far the worse! I paid top dollar to stay on a Tuesday night primarily because my 5 kids wanted to have a pool day. Huge mistake! I paid for a beautiful cabana. My son was having sooo much fun with other kids at the wave pool for it to be quickly shut down 15 minutes later for the remainder of the day. The line for the river was hours long. He tried to put his foot in the pool while he waited for his brother and sister and was yelled at by a life guard. All spas are closed and only 1 pool was heated and I don’t think we were supposed to be in it (Delano pool). I followed the directions of the cabana host and we kept our masks on when we weren’t actively eating or drinking. No person was anywhere near us (10-12 feet away) so this didn’t make sense to me but we complied. That was until 4 security guards started watching us and somehow the rules quickly changed and our family was targeted. My husband needed a mask on between sips of his drink and bites of food. We couldn’t cover our heads with a towel. It had to be a medical mask provided by MB. It had to be worn as we walked to the pool 15 feet away from us. None of the other cabana guests were treated like this. Super disappointment! Don’t spend your money here!!
50,Everything was very nice. Rooms were immaculate and clean. Staff very friendly! Mobile check in and check out was very user friendly and easy. Overall our trip was perfect. We had a great time and enjoyed ourselves.
50,Mandalay Bay had nice appointed rooms and we had a fantastic view of the strip. It was difficult to get down to the middle of the strip however because the tram wasn't working for the majority of our stay. The cabana by the pool was amazing and the staff went above and beyond there to make our experience memorable! Would definitely stay again at Mandalay Bay!
30,"Overall the property was fine but the ability to sleep was another issue. The adjoining room was up all night being loud the phone in the room didn't work to call someone about it and if you are facing the airport it's going to be quite loud.    The wave pool closed most of the day so spending a lot of money on a Cabana was not a very good value.    But my biggest gripe is hotels that charge ""Resort Fees"". In this case it is basically for use of their Wifi...which you don't even need to be a guest of the hotel to use anyways. WOULD YOU STOP HAVING MISLEADING FEES PLEASE.    On the good side the ability to get from your room to the pool is very easy unlike some other hotels. Parking was plentiful and the food was good but the lines long."
20,Room is nice. The view If at higher floors is nice.  No fridge at the room. If youbwant to put your food at the mini bar you wi be charged $50 per night.  Any call to the hotel requires about half an hour on hold.  Hotel is way overbooked there is a line for everything including access to the elevator to get to your room.  There is a long line to access the pool. You can be in line for a while then be told that pool is overcapacity. You will have to come back later in the day.  Individual workers at the facility are for the most part professional and polite.  I would not book with this gigantic company mgm any more...
50,This place is very clean and always smells good. The staff is very helpful friendly and knowledgeable. Strip steak is one of the best steak houses on the strip. I forsure will stay at Mandalay Bay when I'm in vegas!
50,Outstanding customer service they go above and beyond. Strongly recommend the family friendly pool area food was excellent don't forget to have breakfast at the house of blues the waiters are amazing
10,Nothing went well from check-in to pool experience and other amenities. Many things still not open. Long lines and waits for everything. Things were still at 50% which I understand but we were misinformed as to what would be available to us.
50,Great experience for my friends that I was entertaining. We ate at house of blues and the food was phenomenal. Our suite was perfectly positioned facing the strip. The staff was wonderful and helped fix the tiny issue we find upon check in.
30,The rooms are nice but the smell of marijuana is in the halls parking lot and stairwell next to our room was bad especially for the kids. The check in lines where really long with only a few people working the front desk. I booked for the wave pool which is cool but no waves  more of a wating pool.
50,Was very nice but a little crowded from a volleyball tournament but overall very nice but expensive. Great location pools were awesome staff very friendly and helpful restaurants were excellent and best of all I didn’t loose the house on games. Shark reef was super cool very educational for my kids good vibes. Very clean not like the Excalibur
50,This place is amazing clean friendly staff. This place has great food options. Easy parking! Tram down to the strip. Check in is a breeze as well sign up for mobile check in you won’t regret it!!!!
10,We wanted 2 queen beds we got a king. Roll away bed was not a queen or comfortable like I was told it be. They were suppose to move our room the next day while we were out and didn’t. I had to go to the desk and resend them to move us. The 75 food credit was only for pool restaurant. All the other restaurants list were closed. Waited 2 hours to get in the pool. Only to have the wave pool closed all day and waited an hour to get into the lazy river. There were no aquarium tickets available for 2 days we were there. Will not stay there again.
10,"The keys to the rooms do not work. They must be used to get up the elevator and they seldom work. That means a lot of time spent in the check in line to get new keys every time we wanted in our room. The check in counter is very understaffed. We were with 4 other couples. Each couple spent part of their vacation in line for keys at some point in the three day vacation.    ""Suite"" was run down. Carpet is so old it is no longer tight on the floor. Wavy and loose similar to a mid range Best Western.    Location is normally OK because they have the tram to get you closer to the heart of the strip however they hide behind covid and leave that shut down.."
10,Drove 6 hours with my children to vacation for a couple nights only to arrive and be told there were no rooms with dual queens available and no upgrades available and only one roll out bed would fit in the room they could give us.    After that basically everything was a bust. The Aquarium was sold out. The lines to find that out were hours long. The phone wait for concierge was hours long as well. The pool was overcroweded and if you didn't get on the wait list at 8am you weren't getting in that day at all. None of this was announced on the website I broke every promise I made to my kids for fun things we were going to do. Right down to the movie that I rented them in the room - it didn't work! It froze and glitched and no one could be reached on the phone for service. Even the vending machine in my hallway was sold out of sodas.    At least the ice worked. This used to be our favorite place to stay.
20,This place is just ok. They definitely don’t care care of their players like some other casinos like Venetian for example. I went to the pool last Thursday there was supposedly a waiting list it’s now been a week I’m still waiting for them to text me availability to go in. My friends and our kids were already in. And they never called me to go in. If you gamble and like comps don’t go here the machines don’t pay AND they don’t comp for time/money spent it a joke. And the rooms aren’t anything special. I won’t step foot back in there (this was my 3rd visit and same experience every time)
30,Ok so COVID messed everything up naturally. I commend them and every other hotel for trying to get back on their feet. 70% of the property is open (dissapointed to see Noodle closed as well )I think. BE ADVISED if you have kids and you need an emergency meal from the food court or something places close early and fast at about 7-8pm. This is all contrary to the marketing which I beleive is missleading. You need reservations for everything and if you want to go to the pool (which is probably the main attraction) you need to be there an hour ahead waiting in line. Once we figured out how to navigate things around the hotel we had a much better time. Do not rely on the front desk to tell you these things as they don't know either. I don't even mind that things are starting to recover but accurate communication is key right now and you aren't going to get it from the staff.
10,Checked in 3/29/2021. TV not working called guest services waited for 20 minutes no one answered. Opened the minibar in the room there was a container with food that didn’t belong to us. Music was loud out the hallway.
40,Easy in and out without waiting in a long line at check in. Nice hotel. Large comfortable room with nice bathroom. Casino as expected. Connects to Luxor. Did not get to the pools but they looked very nice. Easy transport in and out with good signage.
50,From first pulling up to checking out the entire stay was very professional and family oriented. The front door greeting and luggage carriers were extremely helpful. All the staff through the three days were very helpful and friendly. My kids had a blast!
40,This hotel is one of the best on the strip. It’s a magnificent property. The check in and check out process was one of the worst I’ve had. Insufficiency staffed and slow. Check in took every bit of 90 minutes
10,I checked in on Sunday and there was a huge clump of Jaír on the shower wall. I figured it was a slip from housekeeping The next day after we came back from our tour the hair was still there. I called front desk and no one showed up. The next day room was “cleaned” and no one cleaned the hair. So basically in 4 days the room was never cleaned they just made the bed. Also the sink was making a popping noise.
50,Perfect spot to just kick back and relax. It is away from all the hustle and bustle so it's very quiet especially for our first time being in Las Vegas. Food is great even though Covid was still around so most places weren't open to full hours. It's a lot of walking so make sure to pack comfortable shoes.
40,Cleanliness of the room not tgat good When I got into room... floor lamp switch was too dirty that I couldnt touch. Undeeneeth the nightstand glassy top collected lots of reddish color dirt or dustone of the pillow coveres had black stain.
30,Don't stay here if you can't handle constant cigarette smoke! It is even noticeable in the non-smoking rooms.  The front desk check in and housekeeping did a wonderful job. The beds were very comfortable! The room was spacious and the bathroom was large with a shower and a large tub.
20,Didn't clean our room serviced the entire trip..(3 days) and clean or fresh towels kids next door were terribly loud and screaming allllll night. Rude staff when asked for towels on our last day which took like 4 hours to come...smh beautiful scenery but terrible stay.
20,Room was very dusty upon arrival.. Like no one had been in there for a couple weeks.. Made my allergies act up a bit..Hair was in the tub.. Drain plug wasn’t even attached..Trash was still in the bin from the last guest.. And one sink wouldn’t drain if the water was even running halfway..    TV wasn’t working when we got there.. When we let the front desk know about TV (that was the first thing we noticed because we wanted to check the info for restaurants on the menu) they let us know there were no other rooms but they were able to fix the TV.. (To be clear I just let them know about the TV and they let me know there weren’t any rooms I didn’t request that haha).. BUT since we knew there weren’t any rooms we didn’t let them know of other issues since our trip was short anyway..    Made us a little uncomfortable with their cleanliness standards.. Even walked by a room and heard a housekeeper say “Don’t clean just make the bed” so I’m hoping it wasn’t a room that was just checked out of...    Usually we love staying here but not sure we will anymore..
30,For those of you wondering about the covid restrictions at the pool here is the info you need. You need to get in line outside of the pool area before 9am to secure a spot at the pool - even on a weekday. There are hundreds of people in this line but we all made it into the pool area. There will be a waitlist by around 10am where you will be called in 1-2 hours and then be allowed to enter. Once in the pool area the facilities are nice with LOTS of kids - mostly very young but a few teens also. Unless you are walking directly to and from the pool you must wear a mask - even and especially while sunbathing. They have very forceful even rude guys walking around making you put a mask on while seated outdoors with your own party and socially distanced from others. Don’t try to use logic or science to reason this out - they will enforce it no matter what. Also if you need to leave the pool area for ANY reason for ANY amount of time you will have to get on the waitlist and rejoin your party at the pool after waiting hours.    Other than that the rooms are small but pretty nice the WiFi does have terrible issues the casino doesn’t wreak of smoke when you walk through (awesome!) it’s on the VERY south end of the strip and the tram doesn’t run during the week so be prepared to drive or walk a ton to get anywhere and the staff has been pleasant except for the pool mask enforcers.
10,WORST vegas experience in my life! I am a PLATINUM MLIFE member and have stayed at multiple MLIFE hotels and other top rated hotels and Mandalay Bay was the worst one I have ever stayed at! The rooms were DIRTY and improperly cleaned upon arrival only to be told my Front Desk Management that there is NO OTHER ROOM AVAILABLE. To my complete disgust I had no choice but to wait until the next day to get housekeeping because they again had NO OTHER ROOM AVAILABLE to move me to. I got stuck in the same dirty room the whole time. The food restaurants were like fast food and nothing to write home about. The complete stay was a complete waste of time and your casino was by far the worst and seemed like all your machines are rigged to loose. I hope they shut down Mandalay bay forever. You call front desk and wait for over 45 minutes and no one answers. Long lines everywhere you go. No masks anywhere on premises. Not one slot machine was wiped down the hours I was playing. No social distancing what so ever. And booked to the max. I will be forwarding my complaint to various other departments. I will never stay and tell everyone about the horrible experience at Mandalay bay.
20,$46 dollars a night. Nothing is free not the water or the coffee in the room. The fridge provided in the room don't bother its a mini bar full of over priced stuff not useful. Remote bathroom light fixture and ice bucket dirty. The ironing board small  loose not stable. Expired food condiments from room service. Bring disinfectant wipes to clean the room. One positive the view of the pools from my room
50,To be fair the room was amazing but there were issues when we first got there. We stayed in one of the 2 bdrm suites. Upon first inspection of the room it seemed house keeping didn’t finish the room before it was checked out to us. the tv in the room on the left didn’t work and maintenance had to come fix it blinds in the room on the right didn’t work properly stripped glitter on the bathroom floor all drinking glasses were missing from the bar the bathrooms were missing multiple towels and both bathtubs still needed to be cleaned also. However when we called the front desk these issues (except the blinds) were promptly addressed within 2 hrs. After that the room was fantastic! I just stayed in the casino until it was finished.
40,We went to the “beach” all day. Masks required. No drinks in wave pool.    WAY too many people not socially distanced.    Our sink and pipes were VERY loud in an otherwise super quiet experience in our room. There’s only one trash can in the sink/tub area. The toilet has a door no trash can. The sleeping area doesn’t have a trash can either.
50,The bathtub was HUGE.. I was super excited to see that it was just like in the pics.. it’s kinda confusing to find the hotel lobby if you are coming from self parking.. but overall we loved every minute of our stay at the Mandalay Bay!
20,This hotel is terrible to stay in! The front desk is impossible to get to either by phone or in person unless you have atleast 30 mins to wait! The place is so crowded all the time! The casino floor is right next to the lobby and elevators so there is cigarette smoke everywhere! Not pleasant to walk through at all. We HAVE to walk through casino to get to convention center from the hotel rooms. Most annoying layout!
50,Highly recommend Mandalay Bay resort! They has the highest quality in Customer Service clean spacious rooms and many options for entertainment. The pools are fantastic too! The atmosphere feels like you might be visiting the Bahamas~
20,"My husband 3 kids and I stayed at Mandalay Bay for 3 nights in March. The casino restaurants and pool are all supposed to be at 50% capacity right now due to COVID restrictions. It was obvious that the hotel had booked far more than 50% occupancy the weekend we were there and as a result paying guests could not get access to the restaurants casino table games or pool area because they were over crowded and understaffed. We had 2 adjoining rooms on the 13th floor. The first night of our stay we noticed that the toilet in one of the rooms would not flush properly about every second time we used it. This happened continuously throughout our stay and maintenance came 3 times to fix the problem. We asked for different rooms but were refused and the maintenance man told me that this is a common issue due to the poor quality toilets throughout the resort. The second night when we called the front desk we were told there was a 4 hour wait for maintenance because there were so many problems throughout the resort. We were offered a $50 restaurant credit. The pool had long lines outside the gates every day of our stay with paying guests who were not able to use the pool facilities because they were over capacity. Why would the resort allow more people to book rooms than were allowed to use the amenities? Luckily we were willing to pay hundreds of dollars extra to reserve chairs at the pool so that we could ensure our kids would be able to swim during their spring break vacation. Not everyone would be able or willing to do that nor should they have to when they are already paying to stay at a ""luxury"" resort. Let's talk masks. We knew the requirements going in and were happy to abide by them. However a little common sense goes a long way. When I'm sitting outside in a beach chair with no one within 20 feet of me in any direction drinking a beverage I don't think it warrants the ""mask police"" hovering over me waiting for me to finish taking a sip just so they could shout at me to put my mask up between drinks. It was a bit excessive. The casino was a bust. The dealers and pit bosses were rude or had no personality there were far too few tables open compared to the number of people standing around on the casino floor looking for a spot to play at and ultimately it was just not an inviting atmosphere. I will happily bring my business back to Venetian and Palazzo for future stays."
30,Food o welt expensive. Rooms are great. Elevator area always crowded. Drink ladies barely come around. Machines don’t pay out well. Staff very friendly and willing to help. Lazy river not as big as pics on internet.
50,Clean well kept hotel on the Vegas Strip with a large pool area lazy river and adults only pool. The rooms were clean with comfortable beds and gorgeous views of the Vegas strip. With many restaurants on site you won't go wrong choosing Mandalay Bay for your Vegas vacation.
10,Basically said it in the title. Rooms were dirty tons of residue in the bathroom trash on the floor undescribable red stain on the tub pink stain on carpet allergy inducing cable never worked but fun casino and pool and good places to eat. Pricey for location on the strip.
20,Stayed on hold forever trying to get in touch with the front desk and to order room service. The view was awful as well. The fourth floor. I only saw the top of another portion of the hotel. My view was air-conditioning units and etc. Staff would not switch my room.
20,Please see list of problems we had. I don't want to list all the problems again. Some other problems were long waits tobeat at resteraunts and many resteraunts were not open. Valetnparkingbwas provided by other hotel on the strip. You should have provided atleast a caddy to carry luggage if valet not available.
50,Mandalay Bay always delivers a great experience. We have been coming to Mandalay Bay for the past 20 years always introducing new friends to this amazing resort. The hotel and accomodations are always phenomenal the resort is always clean the staff super friendly  the restaurants are amazing - and once the pools open - thats when the fun begins!  Love the pools and the beaches the shark reef the lazy river the wave pool and all of the restaurants on the beach.  The spanning resort also has a Shark Reef Aquarium a total must see once here so much to see here - LOVE THIS RESORT !
50,Check in was quick and easy with a friendly attendant who was very helpful and seemed to genuinely care about my experience. The hotel was clean with plenty of evidence of Covid procedures. Additionally the checkout was so simple (all I did was drop my key in the silver box)!  Employees were helpful all around from check in to the little store to the security people who helped get a taxi. Bravo!
30,Our room had not been properly cleaned. There was a used bottle top on the floor of the hotel room. The lotion on the counter was from a previous occupant the glass on the counter had dried toothpaste on it and the tub was dirty with what looked like powder makeup.  The check in process was a breeze and staff were very friendly.
40,Many facilities are only just opening so they are short staffed. Things are not running smoothly but they are trying their best and still maintain a positive attitude. For instance we tried to bypass the long lines at Starbucks by ordering coffee at Seabreeze Cafe. It took them multiple trips back and forth to the kitchen to get our coffee check creamer and coffee sleeve. On top of it all they charge a lot for a cup of regular brewed coffee.
20,Upon arrival the front desk personnel had major attitude problems. I spoke to them on 3 occasions Once at check in upon arrival to let them know that our $1500k suite was dirty & then to get blankets
50,Beautiful relaxing lots to do!  Cleanliness. Lots of restaurants shops fine dining grab/go in-hotel attractions and an amazing water oasis!!!!! 9-10 different types of swimming pools!!! All hotel staffers are pleasant welcoming and helpful. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Security is strict! And that’s a good thing!!!
30,I stayed at the Delano in November and it was a glorious experience. I stayed at Mandalay in March and let’s just say I should have spent the extra $20 per night for the Delano again.    Simply put they had more people than staff to deal with them. Between March madness st Patrick’s day and a high school volleyball tournament they couldn’t keep up.    Took 2 days one call to the front desk two visits to said desk one visit to VIP check-in (I’m not vip) to get a simple room maintenance request done (took 5 minutes).    As for COVID stuff no temperature checks at entrances no plexiglass barriers in bathrooms the hotel seemed downright dirty some days.
40,Love this hotel and the room was beautiful with a view of the strip. The only thing is our room would smell like pot from time to time not sure if the people next to us were smoking. I would still stay here.
40,Loved the rooms. Very comfortable and clean and up to date. Staff was great. Everyone I encountered wad pleasant and helpful. But even cheap hotels provide FREE coffee and sometimes bottled water. Maybe it's a Vegas thing. Overall it was a great experience.
20,Our room was not great. We upgraded to a king suit and the room was dated and did not look like the pictures. When we got in there was a dirty towel left behind from the cleaning crew and the mirror in the bathroom was broken (not the glass but the metal part). When we called nothing was really done about us checking into a dirty room. The lighting in the room was insanely poor and we only had one garbage can. Now the garbage can thing sounds dumb but if you’re a woman you know you’d at least like one in the bathroom as well. No dice. There is a machine on the door where you place your key card to get in-our front plate was broken off of ours and on the floor when we checked in. My boyfriend has to fix it so we could get into our room. I would not recommend Mandalay Bay personally
40,The room was clean with a great view and the bed was nice and firm. No aching back! Love the tub for soaking. Wish he pool had longer hours but we understand due to the pandemic. All safety protocols were being followed.
50,Was very family friendly. The pool was amazing. My kids really enjoyed the pool. Only issue on Monday morning had to take a cold shower. that was the only big issue. But it was a great hotel. I would recommend it.
20,Want a lounge chair at the pool? Pay up or fight for a back row seat. Restaurant reservations? Not during COVID. All restaurants booked unable to feed hotel guests! And don’t even try to stash your water in mini bar! Just moving a bottle is $50. Rather pay more for less nickel & dime tactics.
40,Beautiful hotel to stay! Nice pool and rooms are spacious and beautiful. Bathroom is one of the biggest bathrooms I’ve seen in a hotel! You pay for using the fridge everyday it’s $30/dollars. You pay for any waters coffee you use my bathtub didn’t work and when I calle guest services they were so busy it wouldn’t be fixed until the next day. My television also kept freezing and not working. Their satellite company was having issues with the cables inside the rooms. Was very disappointed to pay so much for a high end hotel and couldn’t watch television or enjoy the bathtub.
50,We were so impressed with the helpful staff. From dinner reservations to things to do they were helpful. The room was super clean. It was honestly spotless. Kids enjoyed the beach wave pool and lazy river. The cabanas were ok nothing note worthy. The only done side was the southern location on the strip but you know that going in.
40,As a budget traveller I was missing a refrigerator (they charge you $50 if you utilize the little space in the mini bar). Staff was friendly and helpful. Due to covid there are capacity limits on the number of people in the pool zone. We waited 2 hours. They text you but you can't wander too far otherwise you'll lose your spot.    While I love Mandalay Bay's pool area if I were to stay on the strip again I would choose a property that is more central. It's a long way to the other end.
10,Waited six hours for a room after doing 24 hour check in prior. Was told they had no control over when rooms would be ready and after requesting adjoining rooms or same slot at most we were offesrwd 27th and 52nd with no strip view and no option for reimbursement. Room service only came once at 11:30pm for a whole week.
20,Go through costco vacation. I did not. Pricing is very dubious. $50 food credit is a joke. House of blues breakfast is bad. Beach side food is non-sense. Be prudent. Lots of billing errors. That I am still fighting.
40,"One night in an average room was approximately $450. The rooms were great with awesome bathrooms. Very clean and helpful staff. The wave park was also a lot of fun for the kids but the ""mask police"" got a little annoying when outdoors. Only downside was the higher cost. For this reason I'll experience another resort next time.    Two pina coladas were $60. Two nachos and two coronas were $47.    The last time I was in Vegas was in the 80's when a room cost $14 and a buffet was $1.99. This trip was an eye-opener!"
20,Unless smoking drinking or have food literally sticking out of your mouth constantly you’re harassed to have mask on.    Terrible WiFi- constantly losing connection. Couldn’t even watch tv or news. :(((
10,our safe was not working. They said it would be fixed the next day. They showed up at 10:30pm and woke up my children and insisted it had to be done then. My next day was ruined with tired children. It was very unprofessional and ruined a whole day of our trip for spring break.
50,Every one was nice and friendly  great food and great choices to pick from  and great machines also.  Really looking forward to coming back soon again. keep up the wonderful work and keep on improving more.
50,Clean and spacious rooms. Down side many of the shops and restaurants were closed and or opened late/closed early. It was hard to find something to eat later at night. I know this was due to COVID but it was still an inconvenience.
30,Cleanliness is important esp during this pandemic(Covid) much to my surprise  I noted a dirt ring in the bathtub of my hotel room disconcerning staff member : George who said it was a stain I hope he don’t clean any rooms but I guess I will try again maybe?who can chance it these days.
50,All around a fantastic visit. Everything met or exceeded our expectations! Right from the start with online check in and room keys sent to your phone had a very enjoyable stay. Went to House of Blues for breakfast one morning and the service was outstanding! Would definitely recommend staying here.
10,I come to Vegas often. I usually stay on the strip. Very few services open at this hotel so almost impossible to get food at this hotel. And they are at the end of the strip and far from other options. Hour wait if you want to get coffee at Starbucks and over 30 minutes at the only other open coffee shop. Charged $10 for the crappy room coffee that every other hotels provides for free and more choices. No hot water our last morning there for 5 hours even though guest services kept telling me there was after waiting 20-30 minutes to talk to them each time. I had to eventually take a Luke warm shower before heading to airport. And... took valet over 20 minutes to bring our bags no one in front of us but the three men who came 10 minutes after us were waited in by two valets and got their bags in a few minutes. We still did not have our bags after they left. There is no point staying on the strip and paying those prices to be treated that poorly. Will not stay in the strip again after years of staying on the strip. This hotel has really gone down using the pandemic to cram us in and provide zero services.
10,While on our first vacation in over a year due to covid we were grossly disappointed with the Mandalay Bay. Woke up to no hot water which caused problems for our special needs son. We also had to be moved rooms because our air conditioning was broken and the room was over 80 degrees.
20,I've stayed at all of the MGM locations in Vegas this was our first time at Mandalay Bay. We had a comped two bedroom suite which was great. Dated decor and furniture but we like the nostalgic feel anyways and it was free. That being said they do NOT offer free coffee in the hotel rooms. You now have to buy the cup and coffee if you want to use their coffee maker. $6 dollars for a cup of hotel room basic coffee. The hotel is clean but most things were closed during the week but not necessarily due to covid. A lot of stuff is open Thursday through Sunday. There must have been 7 Starbucks inside but only ONE was open during our 4 day stay so expect a 30 min wait (during the week) for your morning coffee. Or do a short drive to Dutch Bros coffee (worth the drive). We came to Vegas for my sons 5th birthday and rented a cabana which was nice but to our surprise the lazy river is not heated. This ruined our day because my son is not tall enough for the wave pool (which was luke warm at best). All of the hot tubs are closed because it violates social distancing (what a joke). Cabana staff was excellent. The Mlife booth only has one line (no line for Gold+ card holders) so that was kind of disappointing. Overall nice clean hotel. Roulette tables have a stupid box above the 0/00 making the odds even worse if you like roulette don't play at Mandalay Bay. Poor selection of slots in general I found myself walking a short distance to the Luxor which has somewhat better slot options.
40,The hotel was nice but but elevator area on our floor had an overflowing garbage can and food on the floor. The water was turned off on our 2nd full day there so it was a cold shower or none at all. It is a nice looking hotel but not sure we would stay again. The shark reef aquarium was the same price as our one in Newport Oregon but ours is way better. Loved the VR experience however that was amazing!
30,Garbage left in the hallway too long and it smelled. Lobby beach and casino were great! Not a lot was open but the places that were had great food. I liked that people could bring their dogs .......
30,Tram wasn't working not a good location unless you can walk long distances.we like to stay on Fremont Street is a lot better if you don't want to walk forever. On hold forever when you call to ask for anything from guest services.
50,Enjoyed the entire stay very clean very nice rooms & view. Only complaint I have is about Guest Services I ordered room service for breakfast & the staff was very rude and impatient. That was the only issue other than being short on staff at the time of check in! Overall it was an amazing stay we loved the amenities & our room the boys enjoyed it! Thanks again Mandalay Bay we will see you again!
50,Had a fantastic stay at Mandalay Bay. Check in was a breeze room clean & quiet staff very nice. Pool area is amazing! Only downfall is people that leave their garbage and towels out in pool area and expect staff to clean up.
10,The service was terrible. I had booked my reservation online on March 24 2 days prior to my stay. I had confirmation emails confirmation on the website and much more all ready when we got to the check in. Once we got there their system was broken and couldn’t find our reservation. We stood there for an hour arguing going through 3 different managers. They finally charged us for 3 nights again and on top of all of that they gave us a horrible floor the 8th out 60 something floors. We drove 7 hours from Los Angeles and were all tired and the check in system couldn’t even compensate with that. Overall horrible experience should’ve gotten zero stars do not recommend this place. I’d rather spend money somewhere else.
50,My husband and I weren’t sure what to expect with this stay since the world is still dealing with COVID. Glad to say that we were pleasantly surprised. The resort has a laid back atmosphere and wasn’t as crowded as the other resorts on the strip which made us feel safe and at ease. The resort doesn’t seem to attract the party crowds as much as families which was fine for us.
50,Although nothing is perfect Mandalay Bay worked really hard to make me believe otherwise. There are minor things that could have been better but I definitely give them 5stars and I would love to stay there again.
40,We had a wonderful stay at the Mandalay Bay. Felt safe and protected from virus as much as could be expected in a huge resort. Our only complaint was the smell of marijuana in the hallways. It was overwhelming at times and disgusting.
50,Everything was great! Room was comfortable. Gosh those pillows! Border grill was amazing! Best food of the trip! Make sure to research hours of operations for stores/restaurants. It was hard finding open places.
50,I had an amazing visit to Mandalay Bay!! I stayed in a penthouse sky view suite and it was spectacular!! Super clean very comfortable and great view of the strip!! Mandalay Bay is definitely one of my favorite places to visit in Las Vegas!! Can’t wait to visit again.
10,I fell in the shower get injured and there asking me if my husband hurts me. They tried to get me to sign something so I wouldn't sue for 3 free nights and 100 food beverage. You can't eat there for less than 200 feeding a family of 4. Either way I felt insulted and embarrassed by them. I would say to try somewhere else they are not on your side at all
20,Rude guests that partied from 10pm - 4a called security to shut them up for the first two nights. Walls are paper thin. Moved on the 3rd night they put me by the elevator so lots of noise and traffic again. Beds were uncomfortable woke up with a sore back and pillows so fluffy that my neck had the most painful kink in it.
20,Staff and hotel have a long way to go before reopening to capacity. The pandemic has definitely enticed staff to be less diligent with work responsibilities. The ambience felt as if staff has gotten lazy
30,No water Floors 20 and above. Assigned a room on 8th Floor that wasn't made up. No bedding etc. This was at 3:30 half hour after check-in time. Elevators packed. No social distancing. For a fairly expensive hotel these things should never happen. Do not think I will stay here again or recommend to others
20,We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. 4 guests total. Room was not thoroughly cleaned from previous guests. Found a 40 oz beer can in floor stubble and soap scum in tub Even a small amount of gold garland left hanging above entrance to 2nd bedroom. Expected better cleaning practices in a pandemic. The room had six fresh towels upon arrival. Even after multiple requests during our 4 night stay we only received 3 clean towels once. The phones in the room did not work the entire stay.
10,At 12am i called the front desk to ask to move to different room because our neighbor room is smoking weed and its a connecting room to us my 3 year old son and wife can smell it very strongwe were not moved u til 2.5 hours. The whole hotel seems like a smoking pot and no control!!!
30,Found old m&m in the room. When we got in late from traveling Thursday night we went down to the bar at 11pm and was ignored until 11:20pm then was told the bar was closer after watching the bartenders serve someone next to us and at the end of the bar. Pam at island bar was rude and condescending when called out about how she ignored us and should have told us the bar was closed as soon as we sat down.
10,Hotel had no valet. All the restaurants close at 9 pm! No cups in the room and was charged for water. Got the app so I could go straight to our room then the security guard at the entrance told us the key on the app doesn’t work. So we went to express checkout they were only two people in front of us and it took 20 minutes.
10,Had to move rooms a few times because things didn't work properly. The TV was broken all the way off the wall water pressure in the bathroom was extremely low broken vanity mirror in another bathroom and the whole towel rack fell on my friends foot. The hotel doesn't have ice machines on every floor but you also don't have key card access to any floor other than your own so we were told that we needed to take the stairs from the 62nd floor to the 59th floor (which was the closest floor to us with ice).
40,This Resort is nice and clean.    Our room was beautiful and had a nice view over the pools. They even provide a packet with hand sanitizer and a mask which I was impressed by.    It was easy to find your way around and there is a tram that you can take from Mandalay to Excalibur to save some time as well as your feet. Watch for days and times though because it does close after certain times.    The only thing they could have improved upon was checkin. We got an email saying the room was ready and had to go wait in line to get cards. I wouldn’t have thought anything about this until we stayed at The Park and you actually take that email to a desk to make your own room cards which was much faster.    At this point in time patience is definitely needed in Vegas as EVERYONE appears to be understaffed (especially Lyft/Uber)
20,Nice place with nice rooms but.. You will be charged to use coffee maker and refrigerator in the room  if you place baby bottle or coke in refrigerator will be $50 a day ; if you open coffee cups will be charged.
50,We had a great time and a wonderful experience! Great rooms food staff and accommodations .A little out of the way without the tram running but we just took ubers. Love the pool area! Can’t wait to go back!
30,Nothing about the hotel wowed me. The room wasnt clean when we arrived I have a pixie cut and there were long strands of hair in the room especially the bathroom which is alarming considering it's Covid and cleanlyness should be a priority I called guest Services but was on hold For a considerable amount of time and I didn’t want to change rooms because they allowed us to do an early check in and I didn’t want to ruffle any feathers. So I cleaned it with lysol wipes and spray that I carry because of Covid. There was no microwave available anywhere in the hotel. They charge you $50 to store any food items in the refrigerator. Restaurants just ok. Poor service especially in the Citizen. There was a line almost all the time at hotels Starbucks because they are seemingly understaffed.Just an all over mediocre experience.
40,Great resort for families. Friendly and helpful staff. Easy check in and out. Dripping water made sleeping a bit challenging for the light sleeper of the family. Notified maintenance to check into it. Aquarium on site was smaller than a stand a lone one but did not disappoint.
50,Wonderful experience great pools and overall beautiful hotel. The cleanliness of the hotel was exceptional. The service of staff was of high quality. The bell desk was quick and even walked my luggage out to the ride share pick up location. Check in and out was quick through the MGM app.
30,Hotel Room was average at best and the view was rooftop HVAC Units inquired with Front Desk about the room and was told they agreed with our opinion and would relocate to a higher floor room with a better view but they never followed thru on the commitment
30,We had issues with the water not being hot as well as the toilet not working the situation took hours to be resolved and thought a hotel like this would of done a faster and would of communicated that they came across issues
10,Definitely my worst stay at any resort or hotel upon arrival my room was no longer available. They were down to their last rooms only thing available was a downgraded room. Check in line was about an hour food was mediocre and staff wasn’t helpful at all. Check in agent told we had access to the saunas and whirlpools in the spa; come to find out that it’s been closed since beginning of Covid. So much miscommunication among staff I would never stay here again. If you’re okay with mediocre places then go for it.
10,Today there was a troubling and concerning incident in our room. Out of nowhere the fire alarm started to go off. My partner went out into the hall to see if it was the whole building or floor and to see what exactly was going on. He spoke with one of the housekeepers on our floor and she informed him that it was something specific to our room and that “this has happened in the past with this room.” She called her supervisor as I called front desk to find out as well what was going on. And on the phone I was told by front desk that it was also room specific and it was if the alarm system detected any type of smoke in the room. Moments later several gentlemen from security and engineering came barging up into the room. What seemed to be to their surprise the room didn’t and doesn’t smell of smoke (cigarette or any other type) and after looking around they radioed to their dispatch to reset the system in the room. Right before the “main gentleman” (Im assuming an engineering supervisor) left we asked why did it go off when clearly we weren’t smoking. He responded with (and this is how I heard it said) “It could be from being gay.” Both my partner and I responded with “from what?” He then replied “From Ben Gay...the sensor can pick up the scent of it.” My partner then picked up the muscle rub cream and told him “we have this generic stuff.” Which my partner had just put on hours before the alarm. Now Im the type of person that if someone is going to make what seems to be an outrageous claim that a muscle rub product can set off a smoke alarm I’m going to google and look into it. As of writing this email I’ve found nothing of the sort. So now the only thing I can come to is the engineering (supervisor or employee) tried to make a very off handed and frankly offensive joke about mine and my partner’s sexual orientation. To me that seems more likely the reason for his comment to reference being gay = flaming = smoke = alarm going off. Because if a scent could set off the alarm I would think then a “charcoaled steak” or “smoked chicken” would before muscle rub cream would. I very sincerely HOPE I’m wrong on this but unless I come across something showing that the smell (a scent) can set off a SMOKE (a visual) alarm this is the conclusion I have to go with. And right now I sit in between the emotions of pure anger from an offensive and homophobic remark and confusion on a scent setting off a smoke alarm.
30,Staff was very focused on wearing a mask however the casino was so smokey you could hardly breathe. Hot tubs most restaurants and shops not open but prices and resort fees are full price I would try another resort ext time!
50,Our kids enjoyed themselves. We had a great time and the rooms were amazing. We will be returning for another vacation w our family. Polite service an clean rooms. The casino and restaurants were also beautiful
50,So easy to check in and out. We had one unexpected charge show up but called down guest services and immediately recognized it was an error and removed the charge. Loved our room and view of the strip. Super clean and beds were comfortable. My husband loves the smell of the casino. Definitely not in the middle of strip but with many transportation options easy to get to the center of everything
10,Tub was half full of stagnant water that wouldn’t drain through our entire stay. Friends room on different floor had shower that wouldn’t drain had to shut off water during showers so not standing in it. Pool was at capacity every day couldn’t get in but one day when we stood in line for 45 minutes at 9am. (And most weren't guests) Husband couldn’t sit at a bar or go into sports betting area without a 100 dollar coverage charge because of March madness.. even tho much we are paying a resort fee? Had to watch the Excalibur so we didn’t have to sit in our room to watch the game. Cocktail waitresses few and far between! Good luck with that. All in all - awful stay.
20,I sent the review in many other boxes. Please read those as I don’t want to repetitive type everything I already wrote. We will be filing an official police report against the security at this hotel and am DISGUSTED with how our rights as citizens and human beings were completely disregarded. My boyfriend was physically injured by 4 of the 6 men that showed up to our room. It was absolutely insane. I’ve never experienced anything like it and I work for the federal government so that’s saying a lot.
20,This past weekend during March Madness; Mandalay Bay charged its paying guess more than $100 just to enter any of the bar lounges at the hotel. This was absent paying for drinks. What a rip off of consumers needs to get out after this past year.
30,It used to be one of my top hotels to stay in. Short staff was an issue. Calling guest services was always a wait time. Room thermostat out of my control. I had to call guest service every time to change temp.
50,The view from my room was amazing. Location of hotel was perfect. Friendly staff and lots of options for dining on grounds. The design of the building is magnificent and large tubs are the best after a long day of walking Las Vegas boulevard.
10,Understaffed. Negligent Management. Filthy pool area. Terrible Customer Service.  Did not sleep at all on the first night due to being placed in an adjoining room with a family that got up early. I could hear everything through the door and could even see the shadows of them walking past the adjoining door. Management was rude and refused to even speak with us. We changed rooms and they DOWNGRADED us. We left a day early because we were there for the pool and that was a disaster. Police everywhere telling everyone to put on their masks and it was dirty piles of wet towels cans in sand. Only got to sit out there an hour anyway because of the switching rooms debacle. Disputing charges with credit card company and never going back.
50,Our family of 7 (2 adults 5 kids ages 11 and under) had a great experience. The food was excellent. The kids had a great time using the lazy river and wave pool. All staff were friendly and helpful. We will be back!
50,Great Hotel .views are amazing. Staff (hotel ) is very helpful. Restaurants are great...would go again .a bit far from the best part of the Strip( walking distance).but easy parking makes it a bit easier on you since you have to drive.
50,Great stay at the fabulous Mandalay Bay Hotel. The pools were open but the wave pool wasn’t—understandably so. A little disappointing but not enough to change our perception of the hotel’s accommodations.
30,"Penthouse Suite was nice - Although we requested to be next to our friends that we booked with since it was for a birthday however they did not honor this and we asked numerous times even 6 months earlier when booked. Everything in the room is extra - even a cup of coffee will cost you $10. The food at House of Blues was not great. It was cold and took a long time to get even at only 50% capacity. Not sure what the benefit of having a ""Host"" was because we booked our own shows dinner reservations and sat on hold for long periods of time to get answers to all our questions about rooms reservations and comps. Overall the casino is clean and staff was friendly."
40,I had never previously been to Vegas and or used and of the Mlife rewards or programs. The staff and Mandalay Bay made it easy and effortless to stay there and the resort is great. Had a little issue with my water temperature but I’m sure that’s not a normal thing.
30,It's beautiful and clean but the resort fees get you nothing and the mini bar instead of a mini fridge is terrible behavior. That should be information told up front before even booking but there's no information. Don't even open the fridge or you'll be charged. Plus it's too far away from everything else.
10,The check in experience is horrid- lines galore and the staff isn’t very friendly. The remote and TV didn’t work and it was reset and again didn’t work. The bellman picked on a guest who he thought had cut the line even after several people told him that he hadn’t. He wasn’t very polite overall.
40,Beautiful rooms with great location if u like not to be in center of strip. The restaurants that are open are excellent and the check-in and check-out were easy and quick if you have the mlife app it is even quicker. Would stay there next time.
40,We chose this resort for the pool since we were traveling with kids. It was super full and the water was cold. Had to wait for 45 minutes for and order at the pool snack bar. The beds are good and the room is ok. I would rather stay at Aria.
40,The room should have been a bit cleaner. There was hair on the floor in the bathroom and the shower. Other than that the staff was very nice and helpful. We loved the floor to ceiling window and the view!
20,Locked out of my room. Elevators sometimes worked. Algae in bathroom Marijuana smoke in hallways. Aquarium was expensive for what it was and being a guest.Overall just ok for a rated good hotel. Need to clean and check hallway areas more often. Room service was good.
10,Extreemly Bad service from  bell captain wait times room service wait times and receiving cold meals extreemly long wait times and unanswered phone calls to guest services room service and bell captain. Very inconvenient parking and lack of Tesla electric car charging facility when we were informed that there WAS in fact Tesla charging on premises BEFORE making out reservations.
10,This hotel is too far from the strip walking. It does offer tram but it is not always working. It was entirely to many kids there to be Vegas. The TVs are out of date only basic cable and the movies are old and charge 11.99 a movie for 24 hrs. No waters in vending machines and they charge 10.00 a bottle in the mini bar and please don’t touch any item in it not even to read because they charge if any item is moved even if it’s placed back in the original spot unopened. No shuttle or transportation from the airport.
10,No valet during our stay. Made it difficult to leave leave room to self parking since I was traveling with an 8 year old that didn't enjoy walking through the casino to get to our car. The room we booked wasn't available and it was passed the cancelation time since we booked through m life. There is nothing special about this hotel or its rooms.
20,I booked 4 night stay on mandalay bay after checking on their website that they have opened up their pool. But that was a lie. The wave pool and lazy river were closed all the 4 days of my stay. The kids were disappointed. The normal pool were way overcrowded. If you need a chair then you need to be there by 9:30 am. after that time all the chairs are gone and the only option is to rent out expensive cabana if you want to have a seat. The water was too cold more like 60 degrees. It was by no means heated to 75 degree as their website claims.
50,This resort still feels fresh and new. The staff is very helpful and the facilities were top notch and very clean. I felt very safe during covid but I was let down at the amount of the property that was still closed.
50,We enjoyed the fact that it was on the end of the strip quiet and has the shark exhibit as well as a really good pool and lazy river. There were several other children around so we felt very comfortable on a family trip.
50,The front desk managers are all very kind and friendly. Do to an emergency I found myself asking for late check out and extending my stay. They were able to help every time and accommodate me. Truly the best.
50,We had such an amazing experience. Every restaurant shop and activity were perfect. We loved having some distance from the strip and had everything we needed right on property. Amazing beach great rooms and the BEST staff.
50,The resort was absolutely beautiful and the staff was very friendly. Everything is in walking distance to the strip and the aquarium was amazing I look forward to my next trip and can not wait until everything is fully open.
10,I am one to never ever give a one star review. I believe there is always something that goes right but so untrue with Mandalay Bay. From the moment of check in until check out there was nothing but problems. I can’t even believe. Did not have our room type available at check in. I have been a Hyatt discoverist member for years and have never not had my room type available. The next day I had to track them down about changing rooms. The second room we found out that night the A/C didn’t work. Was asked to change rooms again. I wasn’t wanting to be in a third room for a 4 night stay so I said we would wait for engineering to arrive and fix it. Hours later it finally happened. Then the third night the noise from the connecting room was horrible. I called and again they said do you want to change rooms. No not at midnight do I want to get up pack our room and move. Finally 45 mins later security showed up and got them to quiet down. How do I know. Because I heard very loud security knocking and announcing their presence. At check out I normally just do express and leave. But I went to the front desk to really let them know how disappointed I had been with the stay and his response was. Well you will receive a survey in a few days you can let them know there. Lol. I was so frustrated I just checked out and left. All I can say is never again Mandalay Bay
30,Was running late for a show on arrival so tried to use self check in app  which was currently experiencing problems. Checked in had a nice strip view then realized bathroom was extremely dirty hair all over tub and shower . A used soap wrapper was even on floor in shower so they weren't even rinsed out. Asked for a room switch and was switch to a back view  next to a room full of kids and a screaming baby in a mostly empty hotel! Bad experience to say the least.
10,Hotel was nice staff was friendly but the manager at the fountain room ruined my stay by saying cursing at us and calling her a stupid fuc***g bi**h. Others may enjoy the stay but I will mot ever spend another dollar there.
50,I gave it a 10 even though we had to stand in line to check in for what seemed like forever because it was so nice and everyone was so friendly. Our room was clean and beautiful we had a nice view of the pools
30,A great location if you smoke drink gamble and are a non-masker. And the checkout experience continues to be disappointing as I cannot seem to get a copy of my check out statement of the $162.00 balance due. It forces me to dispute the credit card charge.
50,I did not have a reservation when I arrived. The agent at the front deskgot me the lowest rate and then upgraded my room since I am an Mlife member. She selected the room based on a request to watch the sun come up the next day. She also made sure to put us high enough in the tower to ensure a clear view. :)
50,Place was great.....for my first trip to Vegas Mandalay Bay is a great hotel and casino. Pool was very nice. Service was outstanding and very accommodating. They were even nice enough to give me a food and beverage credit for my birthday! I will definitely come back!
50,We were provided for everything and more! The respect for covid rules and boundaries! We really enjoyed ourselves and was really appreciated with the attendants of the hotel! Cannot wait to go back we will be making this our go to.
30,Our Marcg 2021 visit was no comparison to October 2020. The wave pool was closed despite website saying it was open. The pool is freezing (super disappointment for kids). Could not use show box for aquarium ticket purchase or inquires and typical hotel room mishaps kept presenting self (ex. Remote issues plug in malfunctions dirty towels or linens).
30,The hotel is very nice and very clean. The service is very nice too. But they charge for EVERYTHING!! And the prices they charge are absolutely ridiculous. I have been all over the world and have stayed in 5 diamond (better than 5 star) hotels and have never seen anything like this in my life. They charge you for coffee and tea!! I have NEVER stayed at a hotel that charges a resort fee and then still charges you for coffee in your room. We went during Covid when a lot of stuff was closed and they still charged a resort fee. $10 for a can of pop. $20 for a 1/2 shot of low shelf liquor. $24 for pancakes. If you want bacon that is an additional $5. FYI - The hotel is not on the strip. It's a couple of blocks away from the end of the strip. The aquarium is a rip-off. We paid that same price to get into the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago. The aquarium at Mandalay Bay is VERY small and not worth the price.
50,Please keep in mind Vegas is still opening. Patience is a virtue. These people need our support as they reopen. I tipped extra this visit and wasn't critical of every service. We stayed at Mandolay Bay. Though checkin early process didn't function properly the rest if our stay was great. Staff did their very best! We live the beauty of this resort and all it had to offer. We will definitely be back. We love Vegas and will plan a trip again soon.
40,Great stay. Only wished the.Beach pool was open but was told only open on weekends for now. Other pools where open though. Get there early afternoon cus chairs fill up. Also drinks at pool good but somewhat expensive.
40,Unfortunately most of the restaurants were closed due to restrictions from Covid. House of Blues was wonderful but really wanted to try Lupos or Arielle. Hopefully soon. The rooms and the staff were excellent.
20,Excessive charge for my kid to have a bed in a room that said it slept 3 yet only had 1 king bed. Lower number of towels as the week progressed. Everything is opening up yet MGM properties are extremely behind the curve
20,New app check in is a train wreck and room was not ready when the hotel said it would be. long line at check in the I was told the app would eliminate don't be fooled by the signs all over the hotel it does not speed up anything
20,"We had a few problems.    First they skipped cleaning the room. When I called they said maybe the ""do not disturb"" was on the door. it was not and we left at 7:30 AM and returned at 8 PM. They said then they must have ""forgotten"".    Next for a couple days we had a dog barking next door. A loud dog.    The pool was closed a good portion of the time we were there.    The Kerig type coffee maker in the room cost $10 a cup so we went to Starbucks. They have three but two are closed.    The free parking was nice. We had a car and left the hotel most of the time. The hotel is on the far South end of the strip and really not walkable for much of the strip.    We also would have gambled but Pai Gow was $25 min tables (which we would have used) but they were closed. We went to Planet Hollywood and would recommend their gaming."
20,Our tub was leaking and dripping clearly for quite some time since there was a stain in the tub from the constant drip. No fan in the bathroom no fridge for personal use gym is an extra fee the lighting in the bathroom and entire room was dim and awful for getting ready or really seeing anything at all. Our phone was ringing all hours of the night and we couldn’t figure out how to turn it off. If you and your party are in multiple floors you can’t meet up on their floor because you can’t even get out of the elevator without a key for a room on that floor. The only full length mirror was in the narrow entry way with no lighting. What’s the point?! It’s at the very beginning of the strip so you have to travel to get anywhere and they’re not doing valet rn because it Covid.
20,Expecting more being a vip guest more like motel 6. I called to asked about the mini bar they said they have someone come stock it but that never happened.. the drain was in need of repair said they send someone it never happened
40,The room was wonderful staff was pleasant. Wish more things were opened when we were there. Would definitely stay here again. The shark reef is a definite must see when you are here. Great location on the strip
40,The hotel is beautiful we reserved a king room but was downgraded to double queen at check in due to lack of available king rooms we found out after check in that someone in our group had upgraded from a queen to a king room just prior to our check in so we were not pleased Mandalay Bay did not honor our reservation for a king room. All shows and aquarium was sold out that weekend so that limited our weekend fun. Overall the weekend was a decent one. We will try Vegas again when the restrictions are lifted however not sure if we will stay at Mandalay Bay again since due to the room issue.
50,Mandalay Bay is a beautiful property. The views from the Panoramic Rooms are spectacular. Great place to stay with friends on a weekend getaway with two separate rooms and two separate bathrooms with one shared living area. Awesome!!
10,"Hotel and casino have declined. Mildew in the shower and gangsta rap playing in the casino attracting the same. As for the offer of resort credit? False information. Credit card was charged and none of the ""resort credit"" applied. Same."
40,Lots of places closed inside of hotel which meant wait and less choices for food. Also our hallway was not vacuumed the 3 days we were there and it was dirty.  The room itself was nice but did not care for the bathroom doors for they were noisy to open and close.
50,Excellent experience with everything in general and the check in and check out process super fast you do not need to make the huge line if you use the MGM app you can do everything from there. One little detail is that the elevator was always busy but just a few minutes of waiting
40,Overall I had a great stay. The mini bar however was astronomically high which was unfortunate because my room was far from everything. The TV was located to the left of the bed which was a little uncomfortable at times but great hotel all in all
40,Had a great time at Mandalay Bay casino. The online check in was simple and easy. When you get there just had to go to the desk and pick up our room key. I will definitely be back sometime in the near future
20,This hotel would probably be great for adults but definitely not with little ones. I just wished they didn’t market it as a kid friendly hotel when it’s not. The beach portion was close when we got there. Apparently someone puked or pooped in the pool. Of course by all means close it. The following day we were hoping they would open it since a lot of the kids missed out the day before but nope it was close. They were training the life guards in there the following day. The room was nice but they lacked the amenities you would find at a true kid friendly hotel. The refrigerator is only for the drinks they were selling and they ALL have sensors. So if you lift one of them you will be charged. There were no place for you to use to store snacks or drinks etc.. I suppose they want you to buy their $5 water for your little ones. The cofee which usually comes free also has sensors ($10 for a cup of pre mixed coffee that you have to add hot water to) and they too have sensors! So careful where you place your bag you might accidentally tipped these cups and you’ll be charged. The internet which is included on your $39/night fee is very unreliable. It was a bit frustrating as I was using my app to open our doors and elevators. Overall I would’ve stayed at a different hotel. I should’ve done more research instead of just relying on those websites that marketed this hotel as family friendly. It’s also at the very end of the strip so don’t waste your money on “strip view” you will get a view of a parking lot and a cheap motel’s rooftop. Michael from front desk was nice enough to bring us up to the 30th floor but even at that height you only get a very far view of the strip. Oh and don’t bother calling concierge for tickets to the aquarium I was told to book it myself. The aquarium itself was beautiful and definitely worth taking the kids to. I felt pressured to move along since you go through the first part if the aquarium in a line. My kids took their time watching all the animals and I felt like the people behind us were getting impatient. Worth all the death stares from other people as my kids enjoyed it.
20,This jotel  Would probably be great for adults only. I just wished they didn’t market it as a kid friendly hotel when it’s not. The beach portion was close when we got there. Apparently someone puke or pooped in the pool. Of course by all means close it. The following day we were hoping they would open it since a lot of the kids missed out the day before but nope it was close. They were training the life guards in there. The room was nice but they lacked the amenities you would find at a true kid friendly hotel. The refrigerator is only for the drinks they were selling and they are ALL have sensors.

Michael frim front desk was nice enough to bring us up to the 30th floor but even at that height you only get a very far view of the strip. Oh and don’t bother calling concierge for tickets to the aquarium I was told to book it myself.
20,Loved the price since we needed 4 rooms but checkin was very long even after paying for early check in and capacity of hotel was 30% (due to COVID). Non-smoking room had a ton of smoke in it. Eyes burned the next morning sore throat. Our child was grabbed by security while waiting for our room (for 7 hours) for sleeping in a chair in the lobby. He became aggressive when we said the kid was with us and we were paying clientele.
50,Value for the room was wonderful. Our room overlooked the airport but it was still lovely. The pool deck was open and the staff was friendly. Clean towels fast service. The casino floor was very clean staff again worked in timely manner very nice. Helpful Mlife rewards desk workers were quick and efficient especially for there only being 1 worker and then later two workers.
10,It would have been nice to know that the resort offered no shuttle service being 2 miles away from the actual strip with someone with a disability this deff screwed our trip up! The staff was rude and said they’d refund my resort fee and still hasn’t!
50,I have stayed quite a few times in Vegas in different hotels and Mandalay is probably the most family friendly one. They have an awesome lazy river wave pool and selections of pools. Thanks Mandalay and MGM family for making our spring break one to remember
50,Went and stayed for a night everything is fantastic. These are absolutely some of the best rooms you can stay at on the strip. When things open up again I would highly recommend you stay here with your family. Also it would benefit if you go in the summer when the beach is open because it’s just too cold to enjoy those things in the winter!
50,The view was amazing! The bed was amazing! The accommodations was amazing! The mini bar was so cute. I loved being on the strip and not too far away from the airport. It was such a great experience i will definitely be coming back!
30,Many things are still closed due to COVID-19 and service was slow at best I was told that Vegas is only 35% open and it shows. There were no shows available and reservations are a must if you want to eat anywhere.
30,One manager wasn’t professional at all. One guy named Jeremy did his best to accommodate us and make us happy. He was awesome. Just thinking of the wait for our room puts me out of wanting to stay again.
50,We enjoyed our time at Mandalay Bay we will definitely be back soon thank you so much for the great hospitality rooms were really clean the service from the staff was excellent the food was delicious and a great place to gamble
10,Staff are rude and very degrading. Talked down to us. Restraunats were always closed. Very far down the strip. Paid high resort fee and resort was not even open. Definitely would not stay in Mandalay again.
30,Just an FYI that Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino charges for in room coffee - $10.00 for a set of two cups. The coffee is not very good and for those prices you can go down & get Starbucks. I am sure that most of the casinos on the strip will now be charging for in room coffee so please be mindful of that.
50,Rooms are extremely clean the service was spot on the casinos are clean they have great stores in the casino still on the strip but ubers are cheap and did not hinder the experience would stay again easily
20,Charge you for bottled water and coffee charge you for use of fridge charge you for late check-out not welcoming or informative upon check-in no property maps on-site aquarium website has glitches so you think you can get tickets but when you walk all the way there you find out it’s sold out difficult to find food after 10pm on-site WiFi not powerful enough to run video games only 1 channel on TV for children.
30,Loud neighbors smoking weed in adjoining room which was made worse by the two inch crack beneath the door allowing both the noise and smoke into our room. Cramming a towel between the doors helped some.
50,Beautiful room and I love the complimentary masks and hand sanitizer in the room. The room was very clean and I heard minimal noise from the surrounding rooms.  I definitely recommend staying here. It’s a great place to stay!
40,Really no weakness in the room other than the fact that there is no microwave so you cannot bring food back so that makes sure that they continue to get more money out of you for their restaurants and small stores downstairs. and also you cannot use the refrigerator in the room to even keep your own Waters cold without there being a penalty if your caught. This to me is utterly ridiculous especially for the fact that Waters can be as much at $6 a bottle. I think it's almost inhuman that I had to go out and buy a cooler to keep my water in.
10,Due to pandemic I am aware everything is limited In Vegas but the check in experience was extremely long and very low staff had to wait over an hour just to check in the room. Also eveything is very had to access like bars and places to eat they have small capacities so even trying to eat was miserable. Also I was walked in on by the maid way before checkout time super uncomfortable overall not a great experience. Everything was clean though
30,There was nothing about this property that said they cater to guest or have their guest as priority. I will say they had hand sanitizer and complimentary mask (for covid protection) all around the casino etc. I have nothing bad to report but nothing really of excellence to report.
50,First time traveling out of state so I was a bit nervous but the staff made everything easy for me and answered any questions I had I was on the 22 floor and the rooms were super clean and the view was amazing. I definitely recommend the hotel plus the location was great as well.
50,Always a great time here at the Mandalay Bay. I’ve never had a problem with anything. I will definitely recommend this casino resort had a great time. Also bell service and vallet was great and quick.
50,AwesomeOur experience is awesome and great.We were happy with the services.The people are helpful and friendly.The cleanliness is also awesome no complains.I will surely come back and invite my friends to Mandalay bay.This hotel is highly recommended.My son wants to try the swimming pool when we comeback.He is excited for our next visit.Thsnk you Mandslay bay for the experience I hope to be back again.
40,Hotel was fine. A lot of the clientele were very sketchy... Digital keys worked about 30% of the time. Front desk was very quick to give us regular keys that never had any issues. We had a room two doors down with a dog that would not quit barking...
40,Have always loved MB! Just aging a bit somethings not quite in top shape or working (weather didnt help any to enjoy the pool but still one of my favorites lots of attractions options and good times (as well as can be in the post covid vegas).
50,When we first arrived the line for checking in was extremely long. Thankfully they have digital room keys. The was was exceptional. Very clean comforting and affordable. Will book again in the future.
50,I most definitely will be coming back again. :) Room service was amazing and staff was always on point. With making sure the sheets were changed. I think the wonderful woman’s name was Ashley she was amazing!!!
30,If you’ve been to older MGM properties then you know what to expect with this one. Issue with lack of hot water in one of the rooms we stayed in. Front desk staff were not helpful when we needed assistance getting a wheelchair for my sister. We waited over twenty minutes at the front desk for a wheelchair one that never arrived. We had to carry/ drag her through the lobby and casino to get outside to the car before going to the hospital. Will return to Vegas just not to this property.
50,exceptional clean friendly staff  great food especially the steak & eggs at the House of Blues Restaurant . Was able to get on my favorite slot machines easily. would like to see more  $.50 slots.really enjoyed the beverages. however too much ice was used.
50,We would definitely stay here again. The view out the floor to ceiling windows was amazing! I also enjoyed the indoor shops between the casinos. It made it extra fun to have what you needed within walking distance.
20,Awful experience using the digital key. And it wasn’t just me but everyone I encountered in the elevator that was trying to use their digital keys to get them to their floor. To top it off housekeeping left a dirty rag in the bathroom and didn’t stock the bathroom with the basic amenities. And the cherry on the cake was being charged $30 for opening up the mini fridge when nothing was consumed. My bad that my daughter opened it up to put her water bottle in there and that my sister did the same twice and we get charged $10 a pop for opening the fridge. Are you kidding me. Never staying in this establishment again.
30,The only thing that was a huge bummer was that the beach was closed and the hot tubs were very cold. Full of leaves not clean and cold water. Only a tiny pool area was open and it was very crowded! So crowded in fact that we had to wait for a lounger and the attendant made us wear our masks the whole time.
50,My stay here was awesome!. I had the best experience with the exhibits food and the room was very clean. I also like the fact the staff teded to every need/concern I had. I will definitely stay again.
10,Maybe we got worse treatment since we booked using Hotwire but I won’t stay here again.    It smells SO GOOD when you walk in the lobby possibly because you’re escaping the INCESSANT smell of pot at the entrance.    I called before booking to make sure the pools would be open during our stay and was assured they would be open and heated with the wave pool and lazy river open Friday Saturday and Sunday so my daughter and I rushed to do the rest of our list to have two “pool days” on Friday and Saturday.    I know the resort can’t control the weather but these pools are COLD!!!! And we are visiting from Alaska. We were originally going to go to Hawaii but changed plans due to COVID travel issues with Hawaii and it’s hard not to be disappointed with this trip. Due to “weather concerns” (rain?) the wave pool wasn’t open on Friday and here I sit on Saturday at a baby wave pool that shoots out a wave every “62 seconds” according to my 12-year old who says this wave pool is “lame.” The pools were my #1 reason for staying here - we will DEFINITELY be at Caesar’s Palace or Bellagio next time.    Meanwhile OUTSIDE on the “beach” they have apparently hired employees to walk around telling guests to put our masks on. While we’re outside. Trying to enjoy a $32 margarita. Hmmmmm.    The worst part of our visit this visit was the lack of housekeeping. I pretty much had to call to request it every day. This was weird. And disappointing.    My recommendation is to try someplace else. I think they don’t understand customer service here.
50,Some things weren't open and less people made going out not near as fun but hotel was great. Will come back and stay again. Looking forward to covid being over so everything can open. All mlife hotels were clean and well kept
50,The staff were extremely helpful kind and willing to help above and beyond. Everyone was friendly and happy. They all made my day. The rooms were comfy clean and luxurious. The resort gave you no reasons to ever want to leave. We loved it!!
40,Overall great experience for a family trip. If you dont mind walking over three hotels to get to the center of the strip this is the venue to stay at. Very clean and the employees/ staff are friendly.
10,Water stopped working maids cleaned rooms after 7:30 pm ice machine not working tv not working. Not the experience I was looking for in a top notch so called hotel l the experience I had my my Vegas trip horrible!!!
30,Normally always on point we love this hotel. This time lazy river and pools were cold.will be back probably later in the year. Phone check in worked then stopped had to go get key cards for rest of the stay.
40,Outside of some plumbing issues in the room. It was a Great visit. Understandable that these things happen the hotel was quick to respond. The maintenance and housekeeping were nice apologetic and fast to correct the problem.
20,My 2 bedroom suite was not the cleanest. For the money there were issues with the room that the hotel did not fix. We had a tv that was not working and the hot water to the tub did not work. The amenities were closed and every thing was closed until Thursday or Friday. This hotel only had the pool and beach area for things to do besides gambling and they were closed until Friday. Not worth the money honestly
50,My wife and I visited Mandalay Bay before but this experience was so much better. The service was second to none. Every staff member we encountered was very attentive and professional. The hotel property was very clean and security was very visible. We will make this our go to hotel when we stay at Mandalay Bay.
50,Fantastic place to stay and we can’t wait to go back!! Love the atmosphere and you really have all you need there. Great restaurants and food court. The pool area is fabulous! Easy access to bus route taxis and Uber!
50,I loved being able to use the app on my phone to check-in and arrange for me to use an iPad to program a room key without waiting in the front desk line. This made things super easy and fast since I was short on time to make a meeting for work.
50,Room was amazing bed was very . comfortable room was spacious. Casino very spacious and clean. Drinks were very good. Staff was very professional. Room service was quick at getting my order to me food was very good.
50,Was able to use my travel points to get a king suite room which was amazing! Night view was pretty!  There was free hand washing stations with gloves and face masks which was nice to see.  Sadly beach pool was still closed and other pools closed by 5pm.  No poker room.
50,nice to be back in Vegas. the employees at Mandalay were fantastic I spoke with a few of the security folks and could not feel any safer. They were excited that there ranks were slowly getting back to work and that many new precautions have been implemented for the safety of all.
10,The first room we received ac didn’t work. The second room we received end up flooding due to a problem with the water pipes. A finally room was okay but it was away from our family and wasn’t to the best of our liking. The male manager during check out had a bit of an attitude because he tried to charge us a security deposit for something we didn’t cause.
50,1st girls family trip. It was very nice and everyone enjoyed the hotel and Vegas. We had 7 rooms on the 56 floor . Enjoyed the casino and restaurants also the tour bus. We planned several events and Uber and taxi was great as well
30,We have stayed here many times and the last 2 times have just been disappointing. Room reservation & card key problems they cancelled our car service without telling us our scheduled greeter never showed up charging my credit card my entire stay upon check in unable to reach staff at times through the room phone tv never worked correctly and billing errors upon checkout. I used to really like staying here but I think I will be staying at another property the next time we visit.
50,This hotel had excellent staff checking and and out was super easy they upgraded our rooms at no additional charge at check in. The hotel was clean offered mask and sanitation all throughout the hotel!!
50,The staff was great and the whole facility was clean and accommodating. I would definitely visit again. The gambling was awesome and the environment was inviting. I can't really think of something i would change.
50,Was able to telework without hiccups and the beds are really comfortable. I love staying here. The best part is that it’s on the south side of the strip and you don’t feel crowded whatsoever which was really nice this is one of the better MGM resorts for sure
30,The hotel was nice but there was a lot of crazy things going on weird guests animals and plumes of marijuana lurking in corners. Maybe a bad weekend to be fair it was race weekend and tournaments in town.
50,the hotel was nice and very clean if you got up from a slot machine they wiped it down if someone left a table they wiped it down. food was ok service was good not a long wait for service when playing slots or tables
10,Overbooked our suite at delano refunded money but we were sent to Mandalay Bay to stay in a regular room. TV did not worksome elevators did not work and customer service was horrible. Will not stay there again. And I'm a avid mlofe player
20,I would be careful if you stay at this place. No one would help me check in using the mobile app. Then my TV would not work. I waited over 2 hours for a maintenance guy to fix it. No one came. They said they did not have enough maintenance guys working.
20,Was excited to stay but would not recommend. Internet was terrible the entire visit even after multiple reports to the hotel. TV was out of service on arrival; took multiple calls before it was serviced. No healthy food options in MB had to go to the Four Seasons.
10,No real coffee cups in room $50/daily to use fridge. $75/day for a metal chaise lounge with plain umbrella by pool. $35 for 2 small Pina coladas in plastic cups by pool. Can't go anywhere outside room without mask. Domestic disturbance next door at 2a.m. Pools freezing cold pool float tubes $35 no free ones. Food court 7 minutes from elevators. Pot smoke and cigarette smoke everywhere. Sewer stink as you walk in building from their fountains. Bring your own water bottle it's $5-$8 everywhere. Cabs are $20 everywhere. No tram running. Horrible staff this is worse than every cheap hotel I've ever stayed at. A voice blared into our room at 9a.m. announcing a security threat super loud like fire alarm for several minutes no direction on what to do. This is like a 1 star hotel. Save money and aggravation. Stay at motel 6. Also a vending machine had leaked and a fan was drying the hall carpet for 2 days. No itemized bill when you check out. Have to request it sent by email 72 hours later.
50,My check in was super easy with the Mobil checkin. My room was spotless. The bed was extremely comfortable. And I enjoyed my soak in the large tub. I didn't have any personal issues worth staff. Most everyone was very friendly. Mt favorite part was Border Grill! The food was phenomenal Rolando made the best drinks. And I highly recommend Lupo for breakfast.
30,"The rooms felt fairly nice. However when entering the room and looking out the window I noticed a dirty tissue laying on the floor. My wife noticed a leaky sink in the bathroom and the HDMI to connect a laptop to the TV was malfunctioning.    All could be considered minor or easily fixable complaints but not something you should encounter at a ""higher end"" location. The little details like this send a message about the quality of the staff and management. If you are intending to be counted among the best details like this cannot be overlooked."
50,Mandaylay Bay is our favorite place to stay in Vegas. It has all of the amenities we look for in a hotel. The restaurants are great and have a good variety. There is also quick access to the Luxor and more restaurants.
50,Had lots of fun. I did hit pretty good in the Casino. I did not want to leave. Lol. I wish it was in the middle of the strip. Over all it was a good time. Went to House of blues. Silverware was not clean.
30,This hotel is beautiful and has one of the best pool areas out there. The lazy river is great as is the beach and all the other areas. I also have been to concerts here (pre covid of course) and they were always fun and amazing. however it was my first time staying at this property and it was just okay. The actually casino area was kind of dirty and the room was just okay. They do have a nice bathtub giving the room some bonus points. Restaurants were not great and when we did gamble we never actually saw a waitress (or when we did they passed us quickly). It also is so far away from most of the areas we frequent the most and that alone probably is enough to not have us stay again. It wasn't a bad visit and if you are on a budget or looking strictly for relaxing with some pool fun i'd recommend this place. Otherwise find something a little more central it's worth it.
10,The lobby area had a foul oder on Friday when the odor lingered for hours. My room wasn't cleaned for 2 days the furniture was not cleaned with stains no water on the day the smell was in the lobby. I told the clerk upon check in I would pay for a better room she advised I can get a strip view . Once we entered the room it was facing the liquor store and a mountain. Then upon check oit I advised the lady of my concerns she then said you should have told us when it happen. I really feel like during the pandemic the room should be cleaned and the staff could be more friendly. I felt like I was not a values customer and my concerns were a joke to them .No apologies just I'll give you one night resort fee credit and heres a receipt. 2 other customers ahead of me had the same issue and the same attitude my brother in law advised his concern with the same issue. I am a frequent traveler to Vegas and instead of exploring hotels I'll check continue with to stay at the Aria much clearer and valued customer service.
50,This casino was a lot of fun I really enjoy playing there my husband loves the tables staff and dealers were very nice. Drinks all night the waitress was very nice and kept us happy. Vibes were good and the food is good too. The cold bar slushy are to delicious and if you add some tequila even better.
10,Hall carpets were filthy. The maids were not friendly.  Didn’t get the room I reserved  No ice so I called for some. We waited for over an hour ended up leaving the room only to return to a bag on the door knob with a bucket of water in it.  No water for several hours  Bags of towels left in the halls all day every day.
10,Horrible service from start to finish.....did not even have my room. Wanted to give me another room. Room had TV not working..sinks back up...waited forever to check out. Never cared about horrible service and bad time I had...will go to Wynn or Ceasars properties next time
50,Everything was great we loved the pool and beach and lazy River. The water had to be shut off for about 2 hours as an emergency but other than that everything was great. This is our 2nd time at the Mandalay Bay/Delano hotel.
10,This hotel has all the elegance of a Carnival cruise to Ensenada. Sad to see the clientele allowed to destroy it. Pot smokers everywhere foul language shouted in every hallway. I guess when rates are reduced this is the result
50,Everything was great and clean and everyone was nice and followed covid instructions we also had a great time and resort and casino everything was better then initially expected and I appreciate Mandalay Bay for a good time
50,Extremely satisfied with our stay. This was our first family trip with the kids and let me tell you how much fun we had. We all had something we wanted to do during our stay but the most fun was the pool. The staff was friendly and the food was excellent. I loved it so much I’m coming back in May.
30,It was a nice hotel close to most places but they couldn’t even give anything complimentary and they take out 100 dollars everyday during your stay but refund it after - no one told us that when we booked.  Buy your own water - the water could go off when you want to shower but asides from that it’s a nice hotel
50,We stayed here for our wedding anniversary and wasn't disappointed. Staff treated us like royalty and there are handwashing stations throughout the property. Very clean rooms. They go beyond to make you feel safe.
20,I have kids one is blimd and autistic. And she needs the tv . I explained that to the ladiewithin 5 minutes of getting into the room at like 730 no one showed til 1230 i told to come back no one did. All weekend the tv didnt work no one answered the phones i was shocked i hot bettet service at motel6 then there never again
50,Mandalay Bay is the place to stay!!! Great customer service and clean rooms. There is a lot you can do just In that location without having to leave a lot of restaurants and places to shop where you can get all you need.
50,Very clean and great service. Would stay here again. Great location and loved that it’s connected to the Luxor and Excalibur. Have stayed here multiple times and have never been disappointed with any of my trips!
20,It's a nice hotel but everything inside from the mini fridge to the restaurant is way to expensive. Like I said it's a nice place but everything inside is way too over priced at least they can lock the mini fridge
40,The only painful part of this stay was that the tram was not in-service and the pools were not open - most likely none of it had to do with Mandaly. Staff was always there to help. Spent most of the time at the sports book which was clean and easy to place bets.
20,This hotel was clean and friendly. I was charged fees equal to the price originally paid for the room. Be aware of this when booking this room. Even after speaking with reception this fee is non negotiable.
50,Great place super clean friendly. Rooms were the best huge soaker tub and shower with a closed off toilet . Huge mirrors for pictures and the view was to die for . Check in was done on the app and so was check out everything was easy
20,I guess I was expecting a different experience. I know Covid has done a number on the area. Checking in and out was a pain. We were sent an email stating that we were staying at the Delano and that Mandalay was closed. Went to Delano they sent us back to Mandalay. Signage for contactless check in was less than desirable and at our time of check in there was not a staff member in the area. Not fun after a long day of travel. In-room dining was about the only effortless meal in the area as long as you don't mind spending over $100 for 2 people to have a cold bagel a cold croissant sandwich with dried out potatoes and box of coffee.. Pool was closed along with most of the restaurants that we within the hotel. No trams were open so plan on spending $20 to $40 round trip to get anywhere or wear really comfy walking shoes. Don't touch anything in the mini bar they will charge you immediately. I don't see how they can charge $40 per day for resort fees when there is literally nothing that they provide ) no complimentary water bottle a usable refrigerator a microwave coffee etc... Maybe the $40 is for the contact high from all the marijuana that you can smell in areas of the hotel....
50,Since the minute we walked in it just felt good  clean and nice stayed there over the weekend didn’t even have to go out to the strip because we had anything we needed at the resort . Will definitely be going back
40,Hotel was good just at the beginning of the strip so very far walks. A lot of the restaurants are closed in hotel so we had to keep going elsewhere for food selections. Other than that everything else was good.
50,Stayed for 2 nights for a slot tournament. Staff was friendly and treated participants for free snacks and a drink after the end of every round of slot competition at Eye Candy bar. Room was clean good view staff were professionals. Recommend the location especially if you took a flight to Vegas.
50,First time guest at the Mandalay Bay hotel property! Went with a friends to celebrate some birthdays among us and we all had an amazing time. The front desk check in and check out was easy and fast. Also when asking for an upgraded room the front desk member went above and beyond for our request. We gladly accepted the upgrade fee change and had an amazing experience for our first time visit to Mandalay Bay. I highly recommend visiting this place as the casino is one of the closest MGM properties to the airport and it was the first major property on the strip so it was easy to access the other casinos without forgetting where Mandalay Bay was since it’s the first one! Great place and great value.
30,Room was not cleaned properly. Found a half drank water bottle under a chair in the room. Carpet was not vacuumed. The glasses in the room for use were not clean. At a time with COVID-19 going on I would expect a more clean/sanitized room.
30,I felt since I’ve never stayed at Mandalay Bay I was gonna give it a shot and stay this time around. I arrived around 12a so I was very tired they didn’t have the exact room I reserved and it took almost 5 minutes to get the hot water running in shower. Also the sheets need fabric softener there was nothing but static electricity all in the building and every metal object we touched we were getting shocked. So irritating.....
20,Stayed at Mandalay Bay...the rooms are getting old and tired the coffee machine and the keys did not work...the casino was surprising small with almost no variety of machines. the bed was comfortable and there was a bathtub (but not with jets)
30,Nice hotel if you get a good deal kinda far from everything and ubers/lyfts take forever. Overall no complaints except I wish I stayed more in the middle of the strip to be closer to fast food and more night life.
50,Loved the view space bathroom assistance... loved everything about this hotel & will definitely be returning soon ❤️ Everything was absolutely beautiful and super comfortable I love this hotel so much
20,Assuming due to COVID we only talked to someone once to ask that they remove mini bar/coffee charges because we touched these items. They obliged with no problems and apologized but good thing we reviewed our account! Who charges $12 for cheap coffee in a hotel room? What happened to FREE coffee?! And if you decide to pay $20 for a bottle of Figi water check the exoneration date. The hotties were over 6 months expired. Water pressure was terrible. And be prepared to walk far with your bags! Not much open during the week be prepared.
50,We had a great 1 night stay. The hotel is clean the bed is comfortable. The view from our room was awesome. We will definitely go back when we can use their amenities such as pool & gym for a couple of days stay.
50,It was our daughter’s 22nd birthday and our entire stay at The Mandalay Bay was one of the best we’ve had in a long time. The staff was excellent and attentive our room was beautiful the casino and all other services were great. We plan on going back this weekend!!
50,I stayed at the Mandalay over the weekend it was great. Rooms are great and restaurants are greater. Definitely would stay at this place over and over. The staff are professional and the steps they took to make sure the guest were safe and secure are top notch.
30,Met for family vacation. Price reasonable. I would definitely pay more for on time check in and not waiting hours for room to be done at 6:30 pm after rush clean placed. Near airport and noise in hall was worse that airport traffic by far. Expected more for resorts not at full capacity. Would recommend hiring more staff back to alleviate these issues especially when only open 4 nights at this time.
10,Check in staff amazing & nice. Casino staff rude & unfriendly. Casino patrons scarce yet minimum bets on table were $15 on a Thursday. That’s ok if staff friendly. Not at this establishment though. We spent more time at other casinos & slept here
50,Always nice and friendly place to stay .I liked the fact that they proved mask and hand sanitize for you in the room . Hotel is up on all the spacing . You will love to stay here we do always . Nice and convent.
50,My wife and I brought our youngest son to Vegas for his 21st birthday. We chose Mandalay based on location on the strip and reputation. The updated stay well rooms were great and the restaurants in the hotel were good as well.
50,We had a great time at the Mandalay Bay Resort. Everyone one was pleasant and made our trip a fabulous one. When they made a mistake they corrected it without hesitation and went above and beyond to accommodate us! Loved every single moment!! Thank you Mandalay Bau!
20,For being such a high end hotel I was thoroughly disappointed. Water pressure is horrible in the shower. Our bathroom is dirty upon arrival. There was a large party next-door to us having a party in their room and it’s took security over two hours to come help us. I will not be staying here again. Very disappointed with the prices paid for a horrible experience
50,Love the experience the hotel was amazing can’t wIto do it again in the future and celebrate my family and friends birthday holidays I love Las Vegas it’s always fun to come and have fun shdifudgjdgdnduxjdjdj
20,Room toiletries were mediocre Foundation Room waitress was rude A/C went out in room customer service at check out was below standard pools were under construction and still had to pay a resort ee ....etc
50,Excellent in every regard! Frim the minute we arrived and the entrance staff assisted us with our one bag all the way to the end when we left and he moved the taxi front seat forward to give me the leg room I needed this resort was top of the line
40,It was well maintained clean and friendly definitely would stay there again the casino was cleaned after every use well oriented with the Covid protocols hand sanitizer all over the place to feel safe
10,The hotel gave my room to another guest and downgraded me to a standard room. No attempt was made to upgrade my room or try to get an equal room. They downgraded my reservation and did apply a meal credit to my room however ALL onsite restaurants were closed diminishing the value of the credit. Do yourself a favor and stay at another hotel.
50,Favorite hotel on the strip. Cleanest hotel and casino at a time when clean really matters. Friendliest staff. The only place I will stay is the Mandalay Bay. No other hotel can compare. I highly recommend
30,I’ve always enjoyed Mandalay. However this trip was very unpleasant as far as the guest room. Marijuana smoke coming from adjoining rooms was extremely unpleasant. Staff could do nothing. For being a “smoke free” room I’m not sure why this can’t be fixed.
50,Very wonderful experience as well as the location of the hotel  Very friendly staff they welcomed us well made me feel welcomed  The casinos were very clean and sanitized as well as everyone following directions to stay safe due to covid  I will definitely come back
50,Great trip thanks Mandalay. Thanks to both Mandalay Bay and Delano for helping us with extended stay. Houston flights were cancelled because of winter storms. They went above and beyond to make it happen.
30,Hotel offers contactless checkin super easy to use. Rooms are spacious. It was mostly quiet. Just a note look ahead at dining options especially if you are arriving after 9PM because they are very limited.
40,Stayed here multiple times; have always been great minus my last stay. Faulty toilet and ice machine was out of order on floor. I tried to reach the front desk and request ice and was told I have to go to the lobby and get a new key to access a different floor to get ice.
50,Had fun this hotel was really cool for my first visit to this property. Value was very good . Hotel rooms were clean property was not too busy. Truly enjoyed the restaurants downstairs food was good and prices were good.
50,Walking in to the Hotel/Casino mask and Gloves are given. the room was nice and clean. all the staff I came in contact with was nice and very helpful. they made sure every one had mask at all times. we will be back!
10,Went Valentine’s weekend nothing was open. The trams have no expectations date the food court has two restaurant open. The pools were not open. My legs were getting bit by something in my room. This is one of my favorite hotel to stay in Vegas. It’s saddens me to leave this review
30,I must stay I stay in Vegas a lot and have been in most of the 4 star and higher hotels. I’m just not as impressed with Mandalay Bay as I should be. They do a lot of bait and switch on rooms at check in so you almost never get the picture of the room you spent hours studying. Sure they have great pools the beach is a fun little attraction but that seems to be the only gimmick. The rooms have smaller sized TVs than some other luxury brands. The view isn’t the greatest you can see the airport whooo who! They are at the beginning of strip so only one side really sees the beginning of strip. I haven’t been on backside since the stadium was built so let’s hope it glows or something to entertain you looking at the freeway. I think if I’m going to spend this price point I’ll trot further done the strip to a room that has a soaking tub that two regular American sized people can fit in meaning a tub the comfortably holds a pretty heavy person no one wants to squish in or sit alone in the tub when you travel as a couple. I can soak alone in my own tub.
20,I Want someone to call me about the overal experians because I was going to surplice my wife with a proposal but nothing came out the way it should be. can some one call me at    Alberto rodriguez  7142704315
30,Room was pleasant and great size shower was EPIC but room smelt of weed despite being spotlessly clean.    Staff where completely checked out during our staff wandering around not making eye contact not engaged absolutely not a single member of the hotel casino or floor team even engaged with us in a simple hello hell they didn't even smile when they did look at us.    Thank god for LUPO's team great food lovely friendly engaging welcome got sat for Brunch with no booking on Valentines day wait team were a lot of fun and super engaged.    Overall nice room good location stayed here because during the week we'd stayed at Cosmopolitan (EPIC!!) and wasn't expecting to be in Vegas on the weekend and so didn't book Cosmo and couldn't get a suite so stayed here as it was close and a 4 star disappointing service overpriced essentials (the market) and a complete lack of healthy dining options.
40,Housekeeping Left Dirty gloves inside my room. Breakfast cupcakes had a hair. Please have employees to be more careful now that we are facing a worldwide pandemic. Also when i was sleeping i can hear Housekeepers yelling in the hallways in the morning. not happy with that.
20,Room reserved was given away which caused my wife and I to sleep in a small bed. Was told they would call me when the right room became available and didn't. I had to go to the front desk to ask for my room. When they changed the room I moved my luggage and the room smelled like smoke. Got moved to other room and it smelled like smoke as well. Final Room was OK so we stay the staff at the LUPO restaurant was rude. Will never eat there.
20,First time in this hotel and last! We had two rooms both rooms were dusty and one room had to call the front desk because tv didn't work but it was hard to because the phone only worked on speaker and other room shower was clogged it took forever to get an answer from the front desk and even longer for somebody to come fix the problem. I expected more from this well known hotel. One room had three trash cans and the other had none. They only cleaned one of the rooms and they were one room apart from each other never again I wish I could get my money back!
10,My shower head was disassembled I called upon noticing immediately in the morning— no one came until the afternoon and I had called multiple times in regards to the problem. Once I’ve unpacked and decided to get comfortable then someone finally shows up too fix it and tells me we have too just switch rooms and e front desk will call to work the details out. Front desk never called. I also purchased a sports and play package which included $50 dollars off a restaurant meal in the resort I ordered food and my $50 wasn’t honored. I was almost caught in the cross fire of two woman that had been arguing. They also neglected to list mini bar pricing anywhere in the room or how too access the pricing.
30,Overall was a nice hotel but had some issues. Our room was not ready 90 minutes after checkin and we had paid for a strip view and upgraded suite. Down graded since staff could not tell us an ETA. Got a lesser view room had to have TV fixed and air was hot. Never could get the room to cool down over 3 days. Marijuana smells up and down the hallways came into room and was hard on my small kids.
10,We prepaid for our reservation and arrived early as well as in order to assure we were able to obtain our reservation. Our room was given to another guest. Why take our money weeks in advance if they weren't going to give us our room. Didn't tell us until we arrived. Which meant it was too late to find a comparable room at a different hotel. We spent thousands of dollars at this property and gambled even more money. We were treated like beggars when all we were asking for is what we prepaid for. I work too hard for my money. All I wanted to do is spoil my wife for Valentine's Day and all I got were excuses. Never a good feeling.
10,Room was dirty no one came and cleaned during our stay they charged almost triple than what we paid for Friday n Sunday. Chair was broken in room. We just felt no one cared to listen.it was my sons birthday and they treated us like nothing special.
30,I prefer to skip this wasn’t pleased at all with my stay for Mandalay Bay to be as upscale and Beautiful the services we encountered were horrible. I felt as if I was staying at the motel six due to the housekeeping situation and the heat and to misinformed of the information to file my complaints. Wasn’t correct at all to spend as much money as I have for 4 days 3 nights and to have to make my own bed and never have my sheets changed to put all the trash in bags we had so that it wouldn’t be a mess is inexcusable for the amount of money that you pay to stay in Mandalay Bay
40,We stayed here for Valentine's weekend this year. We got there a little after check in and the room was not ready. That was similar for others. It was close to an hour before we were allowed to check in. The upgraded our suite to an executive suite and gave us late check out. The room was great except there was an area by the view that was flooded. Carpet was wet and lots of moisture. We let them know and they sent someone up to help clean up and dry it. They gave us a $50 hotel credit for drinks and food. They also waived resort fee. While there were some issues we still had a great time and they did all they could to make up for it.
50,I’ve stayed at a lot of hotels in Vegas and this one is top of the list. Clean budget friendly plus I am excited to utilize the beach when that opens. Aquarium was beautiful but very costly for what you get. Overall a nice experience!
50,We went for Valentine’s Day weekend. The stay well rooms are wonderful. All the employees were extremely helpful and many venues were open including in room dining. The best part was when housekeeping called us to see if we needed service that day! Ummm amazing. Oh and there is a tv in the mirror in the bathroom of the executive king which I might add is in front of the two person bath tub. Check out the restaurants available when you check in. There was a range of demographics throughout the property which made it more inviting. The check in process is quick because they have agents walking up the line to help. Overall I would choose this place for sure!!!
20,Nowhere to eat! Reservations required almost everywhere except the food court. Not enough eating options open to accommodate the number of guests. Won't be going back until things open up again fully.
20,I booked to stay the Mandalay Bay in a suite with my family for 4-days. However the hotel is starting to smell of cannabis. I get that Las Vegas has legalized the use of the substance but the hotel prevents the use of the substance on their grounds. But you’d never have thought it from the smell!
20,Made us transfer same day we checked into a room that was worse. The new room didn't have a working tv and the drain pipe on the shower had a loose cap. Overall experience was not worth the time and money.
30,Never came to fix the stuff I called for the front desk was good service I went twice for the same problem but never was resolved and they give me a free room days I appreciate it for that but rooms needs better maintenance service
10,No valet + 45 Minutes  4 front desk clerks + 43 minutes waiting for my 5 minute delivery of my baggage + 60 minutes setting up WiFi + 44 minutes Now I am so annoyed I don’t even want to gamble am in for the night! I am sure not what they want in their business model.  They need to sue their decorator awful cheap decor and colors that are not remotely appealing to most tastes. This used to be a really nice place to stay loved it was very upscale 5 ⭐️ stars . Now I would rate it a solid 2 ⭐️ stars & what is even worse is the clientel here is not even a 1 star ⭐️  so most must be getting these rooms for next to nothing. Not sure how the are affording all the weed because you get a contact high in every elevator. Management needs to drive back up price or this place will fail. I will not be back!
50,Excellent hotel beautiful room! The only downside was the location. With a lot of restaurants being closed most food options were far! We would definitely stay again! We did enjoy breakfast at citizens the day we left amazing food and service!
10,Got to the hotel at 11 pm and is about to be 1 am. I’m waiting on the hallway for someone to open my door because my rooms lock door is dead. I’m tired from a long drive and I was not expecting this. .
30,Rooms walls are very thin we can hear the toilets next door flush at night next door was in and out of their room which was expected since it's vegas but the slamming of doors were so loud during the night. Coffee is not free in the room I was charge 10 for 2 cups of coffee that I made in the room. I think I rather stay at Treasure Hunt next time because there it was really quite. Also the rooms are very distant from the parking lot.
50,Lovely resort.  The stay was incredible. Loved the room and the entire set up. PERFECT view.  Destination near all of Vegas entertainments. The entire hotel was organized and facilitated our maneuvers. Simply Loved it
50,I always have the best experience here! My family and I are always looking forward to a getaway at Mandalay Bay. Good food! Clean rooms. And we love that there are activities for all ages . We really don’t need to go anywhere else when we stay!
50,Hotel and Casino staff and Hosts rock in this place. This is one of the best places to gamle and stay. Rooms are awsome and the tables rock. There is nothing better in Las Vegas to stay and Gamble. Forget what you heard or think about Mandalay Bay this is the place to stay when your in Las Vegas.
50,Beginning to end it’s nothing but the best from Mandalay Bay. From the pristine rooms extremely comfortable beds delicious in room dining to the fabulous restaurants and impeccable service. There is no place I would rather stay when in Vegas. I look forward to my next trip back there soon!
30,They need a fridge and a microwave and you have to ask housekeeping to clean your room didn’t take trash out etc didn’t like that at all to much money I spent and not have your room clean on a regular
20,Sinks drain pipes were making noise all night and made it hard to sleep. After showering and washing up the drain pipes kept making loud burping sounds which we thought would maybe go away. They didn't. We had to turn the TV on to fade the noise out.
50,As always great service  clean and safe. Had a great time again. Mandalay will always be my first choice for hotel options in Vegas. The proximity to the airport is very convenient for arrival and departure. I would recommend to all of my friends family and coworkers.
50,Wish we were closer to the strip we did alot of walking so it got a little overwhelming for us because both my siblings and his wife are heavy so all the walking was a bit much but non the less fun fun fun
30,There was long black hair in shower short black hairs in sink and the bathroom/toilet smelled like pee before it was even used by us. Super gross and very disappointed in the bathroom for our stay in Vegas.
30,The rooms were very clean and comfortable. Not a very helpful staff and mobile check in was forced and you don’t get the interactive experience as you would at front desk. Not many dining options as other hotels.
50,Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino is my go to spot in Las Vegas. This has been the case since 2000. The resort continues to meet and exceed cleanliness expectations. In addition the service is top notch. Everyone greets you with a smile and does their absolute best to provide you with a great experience.
50,We are always looking for good deals on suits for a weekend get away here in our home city. Great rooms and very clean casino. Lots of great dinning options we love to eat at the Irish pub RI RA try the deviled scotch eggs!
50,Amazing service and incredible staff!! Nice updated rooms actually won $$$ for a change!! Great stay and comfortable for business!! We will definitely stay here again. The only down side was that most of the restaurants were closed due to COVID. Wolfgang Pucks food is amazing and the service is like no other
50,Check in was easy and safe! Room was awesome I stayed in the penthouse and the view was out of this world. I had room service and both employees were amazing. This was my first time staying at Mandalay Bay and won’t be my last!
50,I loved my stay last weekend. Only one of the pools it open but that was still a treat to get some sun while I was there. I also loved the HUGE tub in my room. It was so nice to soak after a long day of walking the strip.
30,I was looking forward to this get away from checking in finding out of deposit checking wasn't good to having a room that tv didn't work and no showed up to check it or offered a different room trip wasn't just to gamble it was to also relax
50,Great experience! This hotel is clean good location & nice staff. The room was nice and cozy with a great view. I would definitely recommend this hotel. I do plan on returning for my next trip to Vegas.
50,Our Host Nick was outstanding and helpful in so many ways. I would recommend Mandalay Bay to host any party. We had about 30 people in our party and all of them loved the atmosphere and staff. Even though we didn't win but it was money well spent....
50,No problems what so ever... Just excellent! The aquarium was a great experience. The scenery was beyond another. I most definitely recommend for others to stay for at least two days or more to get a complete captivating experience.
10,I've stayed at Mandalay Bay and Delano several times in the past and been very satisfied. This time we had 2 issues. First when I checked in for my 2 rooms I was NOT told when leaving the checkin desk that one of the rooms was moved to the Delano so I attempted several times to board the Mandalay Bay elevator and the key wouldn't work to access the restricted floor.    Then when we finally talked to security they said that our room was in the Delano. Once we got to our room we were very unsatisfied. it was billed as a resort king which was pictured with a desk and sitting chairs but this room was tiny and had neither a desk nor chairs. The room was tiny.    I've now lost all faith in the Mandalay Bay and feel like we were ripped off. I realize that the rooms are cheap now but we would have never bought that room if we had any idea how stripped down it was.    Our room was 61-902.
50,The staff was so nice! Rooms were big & super clean! The views from the room were awesome!!! Although it was hassle for the parking got lost a couple of time trying to get from point A to point B! Other than that it was nice!
50,The room was great we had a great view of the strip and the food was great and you could walk to the luxor and the excalibur within minutes it was great we will be definitely be staying here again. And I would definitely recommend
50,Great stay during covid. As resort have been reopened they are only opening partially.  Monday to Wednesday night resorts are closed. So if u book stay for the whole week you may have to book Delano instead.    The room itself have been updated / renovated. The bathroom layout is still same from when it first opened but still very comfortable.    Stay well floor got enhanced mattress pads that allows better sleep quality.
50,Clean the rooms are nice the hotel is very nice. All the staff was very helpful from check in to check out. The rooms are spacious decorated very nice with up to date decor.. I would recommend this hotel and I will definitely be back soon.
10,Elite room and executive room that I paid for had clogged showers broken shower handles and when I called the front desk all they said was that they were sorry. Very unsatisfied with my stay wouldn’t recommend!
40,Truly loved the room very comfortable. We had the One Bedroom Penthouse Sky View Suite beautiful room with very comfortable bedding large soaking tub. Check in the only option available was the mobile check in even the VIP desk was empty. Lady at the M Life desk was very UN-welcoming to us when we went to get our Food and beverage credits and our free play added to our account.
10,Room smelled really bad. Guest services did nothing regarding our concern.Wall outlets did not work. During check out front desk did not bother to ask what was wrong with our stay even though i had mentained my concerns.
50,The stay well suited are great  Clean  Well kept and modern  Very comfortable and cozy  Will only stay there when I go to Vegas from now on  The view was magnificent and the service was wonderful  Loved it !
50,When staying at Mandalay Bay expect the best service hospitality and all around experience thank you very much my room was amazing the staff great easy access to everything room service was good and my suite excellent
50,The staff was amazing and the rooms were very clean and spacious. The front desk team member made sure she informed me of everything I should expect during the stay. The security team was helpful with directions and and masks were readily available for our convenience.
20,No microwave no free water. Only things that was beautiful the view and the bathroom. Check in was quick through the phone. The casino floor was nice and clean. Although not many bathrooms downstairs.
50,Loved the stay we had a great time very clean and the staff was a very big help..we will differently be staying in the Mandalay bay again....the casino was very clean and the front desk people were so inviting.....
30,I wasnt told the in room coffee was weighted. I got charged $10x 3=$30 for taking sugars out of the cups. Check in staff informed me about the mini bar but not the coffee which is standard in hotels.
40,Quiet Clean Accessible great customer service and very helpful always fun for my family quiet atmosphere with hand washing stations masks and sanitizer everywhere even for the casino floor. Everyone enjoyed
30,I am not sure what happened with this recent stay. I normally love MB and rave about it when others ask for recommendations for hotels in Vegas. I always love the color scheme of this hotel and the unique smell. This round although the room was cozy and clean the walls were super thin and I could hear everything in the hallways and in the room next to me. I was awaken at 330AM to a woman screaming (either in the halls or in the room next to me) and was woke for the rest of the day and exhausted by the time I had to drive back to LA. I was perplexed that the walls were so thin at this particular hotel
30,Average stay . Casino people are super friendly had a great time playing but that was pretty much it . My two bedroom suite had a nice view . But both bathrooms were dirty . One had poop on the toilet and the other had hairs all over the shower floor .
20,The primary reason for not giving a higher score is because an item was stolen out of my room and my boyfriend's wallet was rummaged through. I feel nervous about sensitive information that could have been photographed in his wallet. After casually discussing the incident with a fellow hotel guest it was discovered that same kind of item was stolen from their room as well. The item that was stolen is easily replaceable however I am highly disappointed that the Mandalay Bay has employed a thief. It was not the experience I hoped for. Especially when it was my boyfriend first time visiting Vegas for his birthday.
50,Place was amazing and clean. The wife and I had a blast. Food was awesome and the casino is amazing. Shark reef was beautiful. The restaurants are awesome. StripSteak is a must visit when you come here.
20,"No complementary anything!!! They did not have coffee everything was at the highest cost incidentals were $100/night and as per the check-in reception it was in the ""Fine Print"" (guess it was in the very  very fine print) this is the highest incidentals per night I have ever paid for and I have stayed in many hotels including the Linq and Planet Hollywood."
10,Plumbing backed up in my room i complained the room i originally booked wasnt available they moved things around after an hour and then i had nothing but problems. I used the restrooms downstairs. Not ideal and security kept breaking up our wedding party 6 feet apart.
50,Pay more and you’ll get what you deserve. Clean rooms and clean casinos. Decor in hotel is great. Love coming here. Rooms are spacious. Aquarium is fun for the kids. They gave us nice masks and hand sanitizer
50,had an amazing experience from start to finish easy check in great clean room with the king size bed very comfortable slept like a baby checking out was even great will be coming back in the near future maybe even upgrading my room
10,The resort fee is ridiculous when the amenities aren’t available. Horrible aroma of marijuana throughout the resort. No valet. Lack of places to eat. Pools not all available. Restaurants not fully open
10,I can’t believe they don’t even offer you free coffee or water for the price you pay they charge you for a mini bar that you can’t even touch without getting charged a lot and the water bottle is 10 dollars alone for moving it
50,We absolutely love this hotel. Beautiful rooms.... I recomend strip view. Friendly staff smells nice great restaurants overall (particularly RiRa Fleur Lupo and Border Grill... we haven’t tried Aeroule yet). Would love for them to bring back the Red Room russian restaurant.... coolest decor of any Vegas restaurant I have been to and good food/great service/great drinks. The new 1923 Prohibiton bar was really cool and had great drinks and staff and Parmesan Garlic fries. LOVE the casino at Mandalay (particularly the Wizard of Oz Munchkin Land slot machine!) and it smells nice. More calm than other parts of the strip but still a lot of fun. LOVE the palm garden and temples and statues in front the hotel. Absolutely peaceful and stunning. Also loved the Shark Aquarium but I think the Komodo Dragon and crocodile habitats were too small for them.
30,Stayed here for a girls weekend for a birthday bash! The upstairs dinning was fancy but way way too long of a wait! The drinks on the casino floor were almost like they didn't want you to drink! Too many issues with out hotel suite! I would check out a different hotel!
10,Wasn't able to use the sound system that comes with the Horizon Suite because we got a noise complaint at 3pm on a Friday (when the hotel is at 30% compacity) on my birthday! Makes no sense to have a room that accommodates 14 people and a sound system if you cannot use it without threat of being kicked out? Not like we had a party it was 3pm on a Friday and two people hanging out listing to iphone music. I was offered a small discount for not being able to use the soundbar and listen to music but I planned an entire trip around having a large suite to hang out in with friend before dinners and stuff.    The tub was gross and had crud in it little black particles very gross.    Overall the room would have been great based on pictures but why would I get a suite to accommodate people if you can't even use the sound system. That makes the value low the tub cleanliness terrible.
50,The customer experience was put above all else. The casino was very clean the servers were on the drinks and the table game dealers were full of personality! The rooms we stayed in had great views and were deeply cleaned. The guest services were eager to take care of us!
10,Horribly maintained rooms poor customer service throughout the hotel and casino rude check in attendants uninformed guest services members who told me there would be food and drinks available at the pool when there weren’t. There are 2 pools open the first had a bar no food and only allows so many people so the second pool opens up called Morrea and doesn’t have a bar vending machine absolutely nothing to drink. On top of that the construction dust pelts you in the face while you’re already dry as dirt trying to figure out where to go to get some hydration. We had so many issues in our room that shouldn’t have been a problem and the icing on the cake was the water pouring in from the room above us because the tub had a hole in it. I had an engineer and 6 security guards in my room at 4am taking pics for their reports while I was laying in bed with my husband hoping the nightmare would end and they would leave. We were offered a food/drink voucher that was a nightmare to use and give a late checkout. I called to confirm our late checkout and the security manager did put in for it but no one alerted the housekeeper. I was getting dressed and even though our sign was on the door the maid barged right in as I was dressing. How embarrassing!
50,Had such an amazing honeymoon @ Mandalay Bay!  Staff was friendly and efficient.  Rooms were clean and anything you needed was given.  In Door Dining was amazing.  The resort was clean!  The restaurants & bars were amazing!  Great location & shops!
30,Clean room. Decent view. Nice sized bathroom. Tub was a plus. Price was great for our budget And allowed us to spend money doing other things. Took 4 attempts to resolve a tv issue which was frustrating.
50,Mandalay Bay provided a safe experience. Precautions used during Covid pandemic are top notch. At no time did I feel they slipped with safety.  For a last minute trip we got an awesome view of the Las Vegas Valley.
10,Our key pad was broken when we arrived at midnight. We waited over an hour in the hallway for someone to fix. It took 4 workers to figure out what to do. A security guard sat and watched us like we were criminals. The hotel gave us vouchers for 2 drinks after we waited forever. Terrible customer service!
50,Love the staff and experience. Great service. Able to walk to other hotels. Great selection of slots. Great food at the restaurants. Great service at the restaurants. Was able to enjoy family and friends.
50,Very clean everyone was friendly. Had a great first trip to vegas. Has a great time in the sports book. It was very roomy and they helped a new sports better. The room was wonderful and clean. We will be back!!!!!
40,One of the last clean/not ghetto hotels left on the strip. We are never disappointed when we stay at Mandalay. Bars are restaurants are still great. The casino floor/rooms do not reek of Marijuana smell like other casinos..
50,I recently stayed at Mandalay and was really impressed with the hand was station on the floor and hand sanitizer stations throughout the casino. The room I stayed in was a “Stay Well” room and it had a lot of upgraded features that really enhanced my experience in the room.
10,I was told at the front desk when booking my room that VIP services was closed and that I wouldn't be able to use my rewards offer but that I would be able to contact them and they would be able switch my reservation over to my reward offer. This is the reason I choose to leave Venetian and come to Mandalay as I have really enjoyed your resort in the past and I had a great offer for a complimentary room and $100 free play and $100 resort credit. When we get to the room I quickly realized that I was being taken advantage of by my friends as they raided the mini-bar. I immediately went to the front desk and reported them to security and had them removed when I got back to the room the security gaurds weren't very polite and I decided to leave the property. When I spoke with guest services and VIP services the next day they said there was nothing they could do and I was charged $500 for the room resort fee early check in fee and the mini-bar. I understand that I was taken advantage of by my friends but I also feel like I was taken advantage of by Mandalay and I just don't think that is right.
30,We stayed in the Presidential Kind Suite to celebrate our engagement. I made a note of it when we booked our reservation and reminded reception when checking in.  While the room was nice to look at we could not get 1 decent night's rest because they placed us next to a room full of minors. When the adults left them there to go out they would blare their music yelling banging. WE CALLED SECURITY 3 TIMES EVERY NIGHT. Also while the staff all had masks on there were plenty of guests who did not or it would be 1/2 off. The time we had was made better by us getting out of the room.
50,Stay was fantastic staff was outstanding will definitely stay again upgraded the second half of my trip to Delano and both Mandalay Bay and delano has been so good to me I will definitely be back pick the room guys
30,I stayed here for 2 nights in Jan 2021 and was pleasantly surprised by the room's niceness. I also liked how they made explicit that touching the water bottles or mini-bar is going to cost you!    My overall thoughts:    Pro's: High-quality amenities; beautiful and spacious room; decent location on the Strip; simple but solid guest services and check-in    Con's: The noise from other rooms is horrible - I unfortunately had neighbors who played music and I could hear the lyrics better than my own phone call in my room...    TL;DR: Nice room and cheap relative to other major casinos/resorts but you get what you pay for with super thin walls.
50,THIS TRIP WAS AWESOME! I planned thru hotwire and not only was the hotel beautiful but the flight was non stop and the front desk crew at the hotel was phenomenal!! I would recommend the Mandalay anytime and will be coming back in March! Thank you so much for an amazing first trip
50,The rooms were very comfortable spacious and clean. I was able to enjoy my time and come back to the hotel and relax. Due to Covid and the weather at this time most of the pools were closed if you do plan on traveling to Vegas in January keep this in mind. I did see one pool open on the resort. You can also enjoy the aquarium experience on the resort which was a cool experience. This hotel is a little further away from the action packed strip but you can catch an Uber. Please note that they do have a Uber pick up station
30,This hotel is at the southern most end of the strip. The tram was not operational during our stay. We had to drive to get to other points on the strip. Most of the hotels are not charging parking during this COVID time. Beware...people here wear masks. Everywhere even outside. There is no fresh air to be had. Casino was vacant. Several of the restaurants were closed.
50,Our stay was fabulous enjoyed all  a little dissatisfied with not enough choices in pool area but understandable season . No doubt to re stay at Mandalay just strip activities a bit away but great in and out access
50,Our experience at Mandalay Bay was absolutely amazing. Initially we were a little concerned that because it was further away from the center of the strip that we’d miss out on the “action”. However this was not the case. This resort has gorgeous rooms that are very clean and the bathroom layout is so spacious. The casino floor is very spacious and has an open feeling as opposed to other casinos we visited that felt very cramped and cluttered. Social distancing was a non issue here. The restaurants on site are absolutely delicious and it’s just a short INDOOR walk to the neighboring Luxor and Excalibur for more eating and drinking options. Honestly the flow of shops bars and restaurants from the resort to the other two felt like they were just an extension of Mandalay Bay so it’s like you’re getting three resorts for the price of one. Since it’s located at the very beginning of the strip you’re not right in the middle of the Las Vegas strip scene but for us this was nice because after parking at other MGM properties (parking is complimentary right now between Mgm resorts) it was just a short walk to other places and we were still able to come back to our resort and it was a very calm atmosphere so it was like our little oasis from the busy Vegas streets but with better slots. Also the fabulous Las Vegas sign is a short walk or drive from Mandalay Bay if you want to get a picture in. Overall we’d definitely stay here again. Close enough to the action to not miss out but far enough to escape the crowds if you want to and just relax.
50,The stay at Mandalay was very good. All the staff was kind and courteous. Never did we experience an issue. Check in and check out was easy our room was always clean and had lots of amenities to offer.
50,This property has beautiful room. Great atmosphere. You cannot access the guest floors without a key card which is perfect for guest safety and security. The only thing I didn't like was the stocked fridge and coffee in the room. Very over priced. I've never been to a hotel where the coffee in your room wasn't free. Didn't touch any of it.
10,Reserved a king room for a 1 night stay. When we arrived to check in we were told there were no king rooms available. The front sais she gave us 75.00 in food and drink credit to make up for it. Turned out not one of the restaurants she said we could go to was opened. Ended up buying an $11.00 sandwich from the store for dinner. The sandwich was nasty and not edible so we tossed it and had a pizza delivered. There was a party in the room next door until well after midnight with at least 10 or more people. We couldn't get coffee anywhere in the morning. Only option was a $10.00 k-cup pod in the room mini bar. So we check out at 7 and went for breakfast outside the hotel. The casino had like 15 people in it at 8 on a Friday night and the parking garage was empty so the hotel was not full. No reason for such terrible service. 1st and last trip to Las Vegas. Would never stay at another MGM hotel
50,Staff was very friendly and helpful. The MGM app made checking in and out super convenient! Still need a real key card to work the elevator(it was hit or miss if the phone app would work) but it’s cool you can make your own key cards at the desk without waiting! Love VEGAS!
30,The front desk needs you to call twice in order to do something about noise or to make sure you are satisfied with your stay. The room next door to mine had a party and did not let us sleep I went downstairs to inform them to please ask them to lower the music and they didn’t until I called again and complain again about the music.
40,Thank you to Mgm resorts for the comped room. The resort is away from the center of the strip and had zero crowds. When we first arrived there were very few table games open. Everything is a long walk so plan to take a taxi.
40,We loved this spacious room and had a great view of the strip from the 5th floor. When we checked in the room was immaculately clean however IT had incomplete repairs. It took several attempts to fix however the hotel made it right with a comp credit for our stay. Everyone was very friendly. Casino wasn't overly packed and sanitizing stations were everywhere. We ate at Veranda (Four Seasons) for brunch and Lupo for NYE dinner along with Slices for casual pizza and all were excellent. We typically stay at Bellagio and it was nice to switch things up.
50,Great atmosphere overall a great weekend getaway.  My husband and I were very pleased with the room service and how clean the room was. Comfortable bed and the restroom are nice and spacious. Music was great.!
30,They sold my room after I called and had told them that I was on my way and just stuck me in a room with two queen beds after I told them that the whole reason on me getting that room was for me to surprise my wife with a decorative room. After that night (I stayed for 3 nights) the next morning they told me to call down to switch my room; when I got to it there was a naked man inside smh ... worst experience... they ended up giving me a suite which was ok
50,Overall had a nice stay. The environment was nice and clean. Enjoyed the casino restaurants were good. Would definitely stay again in the future. Also would recommend for anyone looking for a cheaper room.
20,Very disappointed in the Mandalay Bay I had heard good things none of which I experienced The rooms were dirty never cleaned on entry heater and lights weren’t working the tv would freeze constantly and the in room dining was poor quality served cold food or messed up on your order I was just very disappointed
50,Everyone that I was in contact with provided amazing service. I dined at several restaurants and all the food was amazing even in room dining. Did mobile check in and the process was very smooth. No issues with my mobile key either. Not a long wait for elevators either even with social distancing.
20,This was the worst stay of our trip for countless reasons. Check in was a runaround then they didn't have the room I booked available (booked a King they only had 2 queens). Said I'd get a $50 dining credit. Credit wasn't applied. The first room sounded like a nightclub. Second room they moved us to had a person in it. We were exhausted. Woken up at 3 and 4 and 5am by people next door got up to leave and the phone was broken. Couldn't call downstairs. The coffee machine was broken. Couldn't find any prices for the minibar. I was just a terrible hotel experience overall.
10,Make sure you follow up with the staff regarding the protocols of your stay and any changes the hotel may have applied. Inquire about the internet services because you are charged daily. Horrible time
50,We came here on a business/fun trip for new years eve week and new years day. We had a blast we went to the aquarium ate at every restaurant in the hotel and casino and loved the fact that it was connected to the other casinos.
20,very long wait in line to check in poor service they don't care about customer . you call front desk and informed about things are missing and they will charge you for it. It's my second time in las vegas I will never come back to that hotel . they are robbery people without a gun . no one call me so far to try to resolve the problem I will contact BBB ABOUT THIS BAD EXPERIENCE
50,Would recommend to anyone. 10/10 with cleanliness and customer service. Really great. Close to the strip and if you just want to stay in the casino there is still lots to do. There’s pool wave pool lazy pool shark tank and of course the casino.
50,Everything was great. People so friendly. Extra staff present to insure safety and social distancing. Brought my son snd his family to get away. Had a wonderful time. Everything clean. Felt safer then other hotels including Bellagio which was far too crowded
10,Arrived in my executive suite to a dirty room with a bloody looking hand towel in the sink. Was denied a table at house of blues because we didn't have a reservation.....after the hostess said 30 minutes prior to cone back because they were not doing reservations(also stated online too) the nicest part was the cleaning lady after I checked out( I had to run back up because I forgot my coffee and she didn't throw it away!) That was the only good part about mandalay bay!
30,I understand that marijuana is legal in Vegas I guess but holy crap I didn’t think that it would be allowed in the rooms. EVERY MORNING our neighbors would light one up and our hotel room was a hotbox
50,Came into the city to see my friends get married decided to stay at Mandalay Bay. A great stay comfortable rooms and an overall wonderful experience. Felt clean and safe with all the new protocols.
50,We love this hotel. Great staff cozy and clean rooms! We will continue to stay here again and again. We love that we can bring our own hdmi cords to plug in our laptops and utilize our Netflix Hulu and Amazon Video Accounts. Makes it feel just like home!
40,No drinks while I gambled. Rooms clean but water was 2019 of June and we left on January 3 2021. The casino was not giving up no money. The staff was very respectful and we have them respect back. Most restaurants are closed.
50,So much security and no annoying people getting to close to you.social distance and mask super required.safe to have a fun timethe drinks ladie are fun and always smiling you enjoy your time for sure.
20,I just stayed 4 nights in an Executive Suite. The sheets were not good quality and the pillows were hard and lumpy. I expected a more comfortable bed for a suite. Cocktail service was very slow on the casino floor. I had a server ask me for my drink and an hour later she was no where to be found. I didn't find any of the staff to be particularly welcoming. l would not return to stay any time soon.
50,Room is very comfortable and pleasant with inviting colors. Views from higher floor was premium. Location is on the south end of the strip and require quite a bit of walking to the center strip especially during the pandemic were the Tram to Excalibur are unavailable.
30,I requested and paid for early check in I got there at 12pm and my room was not ready I was offered late check out without charge I still waited 3 hrs for a room to be available and I had to go back to the front desk to confirmed late check out since it was not showing on the app. And I was fully charged. Early check in was not honored at all!
10,Room was dirty and shower was not working at all. some of the light wasn't working (need new bulb) not draining properly. Towels are too old and hairs on the bed and seems like not cleaned properly. Need to remodel the room.
20,Thin walls - can hear lots of sound outside of the room.  Accidental fee charges - charged for 3 coffees we didn't drink.  Poor bathroom ventilation - bathroom smell traveled to rest of hotel room.  Poor Covid elevator management - lines and capacities not respected no one there to manage traffic.
50,Had a great time and enjoyed our stay at the Mandalay Bay. Rooms were comfortable and cozy great time. I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friend and family. Price value and experience was great.
20,Carpet was dirty and hard. White stains on the bathroom wall around the bathtub. Room needed better lighting in the bathroom and near the door way. Housekeeping came into the room while we were taking a bath to bring in a paper she forgot to put in the room after cleaning. No microwave or fridge.
10,I was there for my wedding and honeymoon. The service was horrible due to the Staffs attitude. We had to speak with the manager more then once. Whom was nice and understanding and actually took care of the issues we had. However the staff  the face of the establishment the first people you see that represent the Mandalay Bay are extremely rude! This is horrible for an establishment as big as yourselves to have the very first interaction and first impression be rude customer service people who appear to not like their jobs or don't like people in general.
50,Excellent service despite the current Covid restrictions. Stand outs include the people at the Mlife desk (Chanel)  Check-in Room Service and In Room Dining Team and Executive Casino Host - Rick Kozlowski.  - Be advised there is no Valet and self parking is now free to all.
10,This is NOT a non smoking hotel. The rooms are not monitored for guests smoking and the fire alarm must be useless as staff attempted to extract the residual smoke from our room on multiple days unsuccessfully
50,Highly recommend! I was so pleased with my stay and how safe and clean the Mandalay was. The stay well rooms are always so nice and the deep soaking tube was a very nice touch for a get away weekend. Loved the stay
50,Comfy bed and quiet room. The food at strip steak was excellent. A little far from some of the other places I like to wonder on the strip but good exercise. Would definitely stay at this hotel again!!
10,Check in was horrible my original room wasn’t even available I paid extra money to check in early because I got in town at 6 am just to get checked in 2 hours later because they had to switch me rooms twice. The first rooms seal was broken on the door and neither of my keys we're working I had to go back and forth with the front deck lady because she didn’t believe me all she did was issue me new keys to the same room went back upstairs recorded that it wasn’t working and she still called me a liar and wanted to speak to her manager. All and all I paid extra money for no reason and it took 2 hours for me to finally get a room and it was a very small room compared to my sisters room and we booked the same exact one.
10,As soon as I walked into my room. It was a strong smell of chlorine as if someone got out of a pool and rolled all over the sheets and pillows. Then when I went to run the bath. It had black stuff in the water
50,Great experience all the above! My lady and I loved their beds!  -food experience was great  -Uber pick and drop off is very beneficial!  -great employees throughout the whole building!  I will be back for sure
40,Had a view of the Raiders Stadium from our room on the 58th floor. It was a nice room with no issues. Not my 1st time and Mandalay Bay and won't be the last. Now is the time to go to Vegas it's nowhere near as busy as it was before covid.
50,We had a wonderful stay over the New Year! Our room was beautiful. Very big with an amazing view of the strip. The casino didn’t smell like smoke and there were plenty of smokers. I will absolutely stay here again
50,This resort/casino was great but not perfect would liked to have seen more black jack and roulette sit down machines especially due to the limited seating with covid. I could not get on a black jack sit down machine during my stay and was able to play roulette only a few times. Amd would like to see something happen with the parking situation it was pretty far from the actual check in and hotel itself.
30,Tran was closed. Adjoining door was unlocked. Sink was leaking. Crap machine was broken and there were only 4 spots. Gambling was horrible. To Ra Irish pub was horrible service. Bed was comfortable and view was amazing.
50,It was a great stay for my family and I concierge and guest Services were very accommodating for all of our needs they have great restaurants there and also attractions I really enjoyed the fact that they had a winter pool and my family enjoyed it!
50,We paid extra for the VIP package that was supposed to include limo service to and from the airport a concierge to help with reservations and a VIP lounge. We had no concierge and the VIP lounge was closed due to COVID. They shouldn’t sell the package if they can’t fulfill all of the benefits. All in all we had a lovely time and the hotel is amazing!
40,Staying at Mandalay Bay was really nice except for the fact that they do not let you know when you check in that there’s gonna be a huge deposit and then when you get up to the room you cannot put your personal items in the refrigerator because they will charge you a $50 a day usage fee but yet they let you use the Keurig coffee maker for free as long as you bring your own coffee/creamer but other than that nice view comfortable and I will come back again
30,Externally rude bell hops. Had my wife move three times and getting into her because she parked where they told her too. We had to carry all our luggage from the garage to our own room! Bell hops acted as if we were unconvinced them.
20,This place is overrated . Old rooms . $20 for a water ?!? Harassed at the slots by workers  held my id for 10 minutes and called the manager without giving me any explanation. I will never go back to this place .
50,Mandalay Bay is the best resort in Vegas. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I’ve stayed at several hotels in Vegas and Mandalay Bay is the best. It smells like home from the moment you walk in the door. The rooms are extremely comfortable. Cant wait to go back again.
50,Everything was so clean and everyone was so helpful and friendly. And very protected with the COVID so many mask and wash area that was very wonderful. Also if you asked for help employees where very helpful all the time restaurant where great and most of all the casino was great.
40,Location is a bit far and the tram didn’t begin running until 2 pm and closed at 12. The casino limits are extremely high. Very comfy bed and pillows. Guest services wanted to charge me $22 for a bottle opener.
30,At the time of booking it was clearly stated on the website that veteran's could enjoy a discount but upon check-in front desk staff declined stating that the booking confirmation needed to carry that information. In addition it was Christmas time and no complimentary refreshment was offered to lodgers. The housekeeping staff made the 5 night stay worth it though as they were friendly and professional.
40,First time here and thought the room was awesome. I’ve stayed in one of their sister hotels in Mississippi and as nice as it is this is even better. As far s the casino it’s not for the cheaper player. But nice place.
10,Stayed at a penthouse suite and room was dusty bathrooms were not really clean. Couch has some smell. Housekeeping shortage I guess. The front desk people were not very helpful and seems cranky. Not coming back to this hotel that’s for sure.
50,My wife and I spent four days right after Christmas. We were hesitant at first giving the circumstances. The check in process was quick. It seems the occupancy during our visit was low. Our room was a two room suite. Very spacious. Had a view of the airport. Surprisingly we never heard any noise from the airport during our visit. Most restaurants at the hotel were either closed or had limited service. Starbucks is on site. I recommend House of Blues as a place to eat. Service was good and food was above average. The casino floor has plenty of space which we liked. There are plenty of slots and table games to choose. The COVID protocols are to be commended at the hotel. The staff was wonderful. This is a pet friendly hotel and our dog was welcomed everywhere. Pet relief area downstairs by the pool entrance. Hotel is beautiful. We wish the hotel was more lively but the pandemic has caused people to not visit Las Vegas. I highly recommend this hotel. My wife and I will be back and hopefully it will be like it was before the pandemic.
30,The room next door was blasting music the whole night this was at 3:00am in the morning. We had to call guest services and they said they would send security. Security never came up to stop the loud music. We had to call a second time because security never came up. After calling the second time security eventually did come up to stop the music. Mandalay Bay did not make an attempt to refund us for the night which I felt was a horrible customer experience.
40,Was an excellent getaway treat highly recommend this establishment. Wish we had stayed longer. Didn't get a chance to really use the amenities but still a wonderful stay all the same. Definitely gonna stay again next year!!
20,Don’t go to this hotel to sleep or gamble.  Noisy guests in rooms.    1 craps table open for 4 players at 1100pm    Reason no dealers.    What the F!  Went next door to the Lux.    Same company!  What not shift staff over.    Rude front desk staff and 10 min wait for the privilege to speak to them.
40,Beautiful property friendly staff and clean rooms. But noise from neighbors in adjoining room (separated by in-room door) kept us up half the night. In-room coffee $10 a day rather than complimentary. No in-room fridge (for guest use) or microwave. Restaurants way overpriced for level of quality.
50,We had a great time. The staff was awesome and everything was clean I mean really clean. They cleaned the room daily and that was just great. I would like to thank the staff for a great job and a great time.
50,We loved the rooms the hotel itself is very well kept. Everything was clean and to our liking we will be back!I think our only complaint was that we typically were not playing long enough for the cocktails to get back to us. But I did turned $90 into $300 at the blackjack tables Saturday night and that was just fantastic!
40,Escaped to Las Vegas for a get-away. The casino was quieter and cleaner than ever before and many food places were closed (kind of expected that because of Covid & fewer tourists) but we still had a good time. The aquarium at the hotel books up so I recommend getting tickets at least a day ahead.
10,I have stayed at this hotel many times normally they have exceptional service. This last visit the rooms were not up to their normal standards that I have seen. 1st room: TV wasn't working 2nd room: heater did not work (it was a cold night). For what I paid I could of gotten a better room somewhere else on the strip for this trip.
30,I was expecting a renovated room as seen & featured on booking websites but I got an old one. My room wasn’t filthy but I used my own disinfectant wipes to be extra safe & wiped every surface down for my family’s sake. I did however report a stained bedsheet cracked sink & a bottled water someone drank out of. I guess housekeeping missed those things. Guest services was nice to offer a different room but we dealt with it. They said we weren’t going to be charged for things we didn’t use or cause damage to. FYI the bottled water & coffee are not free. Also the mini fridge has sensors so you’ll get charged if any of the drinks were removed. I recommend bringing your own hand/body soap as the complimentary soap is very drying & harsh on the skin. Put it this way my hands felt like I had used sanitizer to cleanse them during my entire stay. During the pandemic a lot of the restaurants even Starbucks was closed. We ordered food at Citizens. Pricey like everything else but good food. It’s a far walk to the food court but Subway is open 24/7. Overall my experience was just ok.
40,It was a nice stay the room was good there was no garbage bags in the room garbage and the tub was derty but other then that it was a nice stay great staff good food great gambling and lots of other fun stuff
50,All staff was very helpful.  Hotel clean with amazing amenities. Will gladly staff here in the future. Room service was excellent. The room service was delicious and served within a timely manner. The Steak house in the casino was one of the best parts of our trip. You have to dine there at least once. Overall very pleased with our experience at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino.
30,Nice clean rooms casino and dining. Poor service from hotel lobby manager Hguyen. The Lupo was delicious with 5 star service. The casino is well ventilated. I loved our elite king room with the large tub.
50,I stayed at The Mandalay Bay over Christmas because I did not want to be home alone in LA. The staff was amazing great room rate and everything was so clean :) I ate on the property went into the pool and I felt secure there.
10,Vehicle was stolen. Horrible customer service. Failure in humanity all together. I’d never recommend this place to anyone. I cannot believe the hotel would not have cameras especially after the 2017 massacre. It’s been years! And this hotel was actually okay with my 9 month old son having ZERO SHELTER or ANY type of transportation back to California.
50,I have nothing negative to say! Our entire time was absolutely perfect! We were respected and our service dog was allowed to be with us at all times! Couldn’t of asked for a better time until next time! We’ll be back very soon!
50,Room was up to date clean and every member of the Mandalay staff was extremely pleasant. Things are slow due to Covid. But the staff was on point and eager to work and help in anyway they could. Thank you!
10,When you book online it doesnt tell you about the $100 deposit for each night you stay and it charges you a resort fee of $40 for services you don’t use. The TV constantly goes out and wont let you watch anything. There is a stocked fridge and if you put any thing of your own in the fridge they charge you a $50 fee not to mention they do not supply any complimentary coffee. I even went to a different casino to gamble because i wasnt giving them more of my money. I booked 3 nights but only stayed their one night and we stayed somewhere else the other 2. To top it off their staff is rude
20,"Registered guests. Hotel lobby manager ""Hguyen"" told us Avis car rental was on 4th floor of parking garage. This resulted in 2 disabled people walking the long way to 4th floor parking garage only to call Avis and find out desk was right behind hotel lobby desk. So we had to walk back and told Hguyen of her error. NO APOLOGY WAS GIVEN. SHE DIDNT SEEM TO CARE that she caused us additional pain and time. Her and her staff refused to give me contact info of a manager above her so I hope a customer service manager sees this. No problems otherwise. Room and food superb."
50,It was a great time great customer service and great stay.Had dinner at Strip Steak the food was amazing service was excellent.Room service was prompt and delicious.Will be back ASAP love the room clean and comfortable.
50,I always though Mandalay Bay was a middle tear resort. But I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms are very spacious and always clean. The restrooms have garden tub and separate shower and separate room with toilet. And the gambling was great there. First two hours I hit two majors. You have to check out this place for yourself
40,Love the rooms the pool and the view. Mandalay Bay generously comped the room & waived resort fees too. The only downside is I would like to see more people winning on the slots because I’ve never felt lucky there unfortunately.
50,With Covid 19 didn’t get to experience everything the hotel has to off but it’s still a beautiful place. Friendly service mostly at times a little rude but overall good. Only one restaurant was open during stay the food was good.
50,Everything was great! Stayed with family. Rooms were clean. Property is huge and nice. Staff was very professional and friendly I look forward to visiting again during the summer and my plan is to experience a few of the pools this property has to offer
50,Great Stay! Staff was amazing! Very Clean Mandalay Bay is definitely doing there part during the pandemic. Cant wait to come back and visit again when the weather is warmer and the main pool opens up!
50,I really enjoy my stay at Mandalay Bay Casino Resort definitely I recommend this place to have fun and at the same time feel safe all the people were kind and friendly  So I feel happy for choosing it
40,Beautiful room amazing atmosphere and great service only complaint is that the hallway and room smelled like marijuana and I don’t like that at all other than that the room was very clean and the staff was very friendly
50,Great day at the sports book good people service and atmosphere. Clean felt safe. Plenty of free masks and hand sanitizer. Have been 8 times this football season alone. Look forward to returning for playoffs and superbowl.
20,Extra charges without consent or notification We pre-paid for our hotel and when we arrived were told everything was paid for. Left a credit card for the deposit. No mention of extra charges. When I got home the hotel charge me an extra $88 and called it a resort fee
30,Room had issues could not use the shower and ice machine broken and one of the rooms was not cleaned. Might stay here again if they fix some things. The bell hops were great and the front desk excellent.
40,It was a great hotel to stay in. The room we had came with a great view of the strip only problem was the fact that we found gum in the ice bucket shaving cream and hair in the shower and a hair band tucked behind the pillows... that’s gross. But friendly staff good views and a casino at the bottom 👍🏼
50,I had such a wonderful experience. The hand washing stations were a plus. The room was perfect with the best view of the strip. I wouldn’t change a thing. This hotel made me feel special. Beautiful from top to bottom.
20,Room service minimum $100 plus $9 service charge. Also no buffets were open. Not a lot of choices of places to eat. I asked to be close to the elevator but was not. House of blues only real place to eat
50,Excellent value  very clean loved our 700 sq ft room stayed on the 25th floor the view was amazing however the ice machine was broke and it took me 45 minutes to get someone to let me on another floor so that I could get ice and our feet got soaked.
20,We booked a penthouse suite for our wedding weekend at Mandalay Bay. While the hotel was less than 20% occupied and closed 3 days before our arrival the room we were assigned wasn’t ready for our 6pm arrival—Housekeeping issues and none of the four TVs worked. We booked a suite so we could enjoy the living room but the TV never worked. What’s the point of a living room without a TV? We were charged $10 for minibar but didn’t touch anything. Mandalay Bay has been one of my favorite properties over the years but this trip was disappointing. I recommend waiting until until things get back to normal.
10,But the hotels StayWell King room did not stay well at all bed was hard as a rock and could not get sleep for anything. The card that we were going to use in the first place we couldn't even use and luckily a member of the staff had cashapp and was able to cashapp the money for our hotel room they didn't have any ATM deposit only withdraw I will say their staff is definitely on top of cleaning for covid-19
50,I stayed at the Mandalay Bay for the first and the service food and casino was great... We had a total of 10 rooms and everyone in the party has not stop talking about the resort and the staff. All good things...
50,We have stayed here quite a few times we were here during a time when Covid had things quite slow but as usual the amenities and things that were open and available were great! We love this place can't wait for it to get back to normal.
50,The location of Mandalay Bay at the southern end of the strip gets you away from the big crazy crowds. It was super easy to social distance. The high ceilings and ventilation gave us great comfort. Go downtown if you want the crowds stay at Mandalay Bay if you want a great safe time during these COVID times.
50,The Mandalay Bay never disappoints. Very welcoming safe and clean. We rented a suite and it was one of the most amazing rooms I’ve ever had. Will do it again the next time we travel to Vegas. The casino floor was also well set up for social distancing. Staff was friendly and took care of all our needs.
50,Although COVID has affected their numbers Mandalay Bay still took good care of us with a smile on their faces (behind a mask of course). It really showed. Everyone from valet to front desk personnel to the service staff really made this trip enjoyable. Thank you Mandalay.
50,I had a wonderful time in fact I might stay every time I visit Vegas. Staff was friendly and rooms are beautiful. I registered over the phone and she was also very kind and met my needs. Room was also a great price.
50,You can see and smell how they care about the cleanliness of every area of this hotel. Especially now with Covid going on  they are even more meticulous about keeping every area clean .I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to stay at a place that is following and practicing the rules of social distancing and cleanliness.
50,Our stay was perfect again; from the limo ride to the resort and back to the airport. Housekeeping staff were always friendly and thorough without being intrusive. Staff enforced mask wearing and made us feel safe. The restaurants were all easy to access and all staff expressed appreciation for us coming to stay during these difficult times.
40,Staycation at Mandalay    Sad to see so few people visiting the casino so rating the floor is bit hard to do with so little that can actually be offered.    Room: 24th Floor Strip View - really nice. Mini Bar - Safe - there's a coffee machine but no coffees + the snack tray was empty as well.  They provide a complementary PPE bag (1) - I asked for another but they wanted to charge me $25 - I don't think so.  Rooms are sanitized and safety tapped - clean everything worked good.  Bathroom was a decent size private toilet separate shower and bath.  Another thing that was sad was that with the strip view Las Vegas Blvd wasn't let up as it normally would be - bummer    Gambling was ok lots of slots - minimal tables open  Restaurants: we didn't really look for place but they did have restaurant's open - we did eat at Citizens good service decent food.  BLTA was great as well as the Spaghetti Bolognese.    Bars: They were accommodating - Covid Safe with Plexiglass - also most all of the bartenders were great.  Pam & Ro (Center Bar) were two excellent bartenders who really awesome and friendly.    The bar near Citizens (Rivea) was ok - I like the machines but one of the bartenders was Rude (a woman I believe her name was Teresa/ I could be wrong). Blonde middle age bossy type.  I'm a platinum M-Life member I stay at all the M-Life Resorts and never have I asked for a drink (Makers Mark) and not have it comped the woman had a full blow attitude.  I makes me re-think even returning if this how you treat a client. Super Disappointed - I went to another bar and was comped.
50,Upon arrival we were offered an upgrade free of charge to a higher floor with a great view of the strip. Service was great room was clean and comfortable. We ate at HOB and the food and services was incredible. I will definitely be back when we can spend more time.
50,We've stayed at several places in Vegas and on Fremont Street but I have to say this has been the best thus far. The customer service was on point rooms were always clean and everybody was knowledgeable about the city. They also have plenty of restaurants and shops within the facility. We had a cabana booked at the pool and they called to make sure we were still coming and gave us all the details. I look forward to staying here again in the future!    They do have a mask mandate in place just as a heads up. We went for my wife's 33rd bday. No issues with it but wanted to make everyone aware.
30,Wish rooms were more updated with the time but nice room with a mini fridge and I didn’t care for the bathroom shower.. small and floors needs updating. Bed was comfortable tv channels were good and view was nice.
50,My room was upgraded after visiting the desk due to my room not being provided in the app. The gentleman who worked with me solved the issue in no time. The room had an amazing view. It was a StayWell room. Very clean and the mattress was a memory foam! Thanks Mandalay Bay!
30,The hotel itself was OK but the room (room 52-325) especially at night when we were in it the most was OK but the walls are super thin because we could hear when people took showers or dropped a bottle or just any noise.... made it hard to sleep at night... felt like we were just staying at a regular cheap motel... loved the view though from the floor to ceiling window... i'm just happy it was a 2 free night stay for us besides the tax we had to pay because I'd hate paying over $100 for that room we had with all the noises...
50,The overall service is excellent the hot is very clean restaurant are clean and friendly employees. Will definite book again next vacation. Foods are good. Hotel is very clean food court was not opened hopefully they will keep it open at all times specially is hard to drive out during the whole stay
50,I've stayed here many times and it never disappoints. The low occupancy requirements actually made the stay a bit more enjoyable even with the mask mandate. Everyone seemed extremely happy to have us there and there was no waiting for anything.
20,Family booked 5 rooms and were told our rooms would be together but one was 6 floors above. When each person called in about the reservation we were all told the only thing remaining was the room fee after the deposit. However upon arrival each room was made aware they had to pay an additional $300 per room for incidentals which is excessive. Customer service wasn’t that great. Had to track down the drink lady constantly and the slots were REALLY tight as most of us lost $2-3k each and no comps!!!
30,"My husband and I took a spontaneous trip to Vegas and the National Parks over Thanksgiving weekend. We got a great deal at Mandalay Bay. It was our first visit to Vegas. Unfortunately our stay was not Mandalay Bay was not that great.    The staff member at the desk explained how ""terrible Vegas is doing"" when we checked in. And how it's ""not the same."" Very melancholy. This was our first visit... it was sad to have that as our first impression. She wasn't helpful giving parking instructions which was really inconvenient with valet closed.    Cleanliness wasn't up to par - the room was dusty and the carpet stained. We could hear our neighbors through the adjoining door. The AC didn't work properly. The price was low and we were not in the room much so it was adequate given those things."
40,Very clean and most of the Casino was open. Please note the check-in process is all online. Download the MGM app so you can be ready and do not have to do this out in the open on line. We had a nice dinner and were able to gamble in a clean and safe environment.
50,We enjoyed our stay very much as it was a much needed change from staying inside and staying home. Hotel was exceptionally careful in compliance of necessary precautions to try to keep all personnel and guests healthy and safe. The limited restaurants that were open had good but limited menus with a decent selection. Most restaurants needed reservations. We will return.
20,We arrived at the hotel and 3 but I did a pre check in. The room was not ready yet so I went to the front desk and received an attitude from the manager. The room was not ready until 4:15!! My friend and I was waiting in the lobby with all of our luggage and mind you we had reserved a 2 bedroom suite.
50,Amazing stay at Mandalay Bay. Very nice room comfortable beds and amenities. Disappointed that they charged for the in room coffee.  Loved all the restaurants. Especially the Irish Pub. Hussngs and House of Blues. Bottomless mimosas! Friendly staff. The sandy beach and wave pool make the resort over the top.
40,Location worked great for our family. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Plenty of security inside the hotel/ casino area that made us feel safe. The guest rooms are spacious. Housekeeping forgot to remove the last guest’s used water bottles. This made me question the cleanliness of our guest room.
40,My stay was in November of 2020.Very nice rooms. I just wish it had a fridge & microwave. The only fridge in the room is a wet bar & its very expensive. A can of soda is $8. Water costs up to $18 for a bottle. If they find out you put something in their fridge you are charged a hefty price. (I don't remember the exact price)  There's a Kurig coffee maker in the rooms but u must pay $8 A CUP if you use it. 🤯  We used a food delivery app for breakfast.
40,It was a very good stay just had a couple of issues. The heat wasn’t working properly. There was no microwave in the room or a refrigerator to store personal items. There was a nice view of the property
20,Nothing was open including the wave pool and beach area even though the website said it was (we checked specifically). Such a bummer for my kids especially after a long drive with heightened expectation! Evidently its weekends only and now is actually fully closed. Only two restaurants were open in the whole place! Call ahead and ask specifically what's open for the days you are there or skip completely during Covid.
30,Though Mandalay Bay has a beautiful casino and hotel the limited food selection and pool activities really made this stay sub standard. I would no recommend staying here during the lock down its just not much fun. Suggestion to MGM if you are going to close nearly all your activities and restaurants then consider bolstering your room dining menu with more enticing choices and prices to offset the lack of amenities.
50,The hotel and casino were very clean and felt comfortable even in times of Covid. This venue made masks gloves hand washing stations available. Everything that I experienced was under compliance with state mandate.
40,Everything is good in terms of service cleanliness and value. The biggest and most serious problem is privacy. The door peek hole is broken. It seems like the hotel is aware of the issue but didn't try to fix it. I felt no privacy unsafe and unconformable during my 5 days stay. I don't wish to go back again it this continue to happen. I need to hotel to address this issue. ASAP.
50,We had a great time at Mandalay Bay. It is beautiful and the staff is wonderful. Everyone was extremely helpful with travel tips and places to go. We ate at Lupo's and it was a wonderful meal. I would highly recommend this place.
50,The priority was on cleanliness and making the stay comfortable. We had an amazing stay. The staff was very friendly and the beds were comfortable. We will definitely be staying here again soon. Thank you!
50,The resort was extremely nice. The staff was always pleasant and informational. We enjoyed our stay with the exception of the fact that we had decided to stay on the Stay Well floor which one would think that this meant that the atmosphere would be one of healthy living. Unfortunately this was not the case as there were numerous rooms smoking pot. By the third day not only did the hallways smell the smell had leaked into our room. Even with multiple complaints to security nothing was done. Why advertise a healthy environment if you are not going to stand behind it?
50,We liked that it was less crowded being down in the south end. It was easier to get in and out of the hotel when we went to Red Rock and Hoover Dam. Whole Foods and some restaurants just a few minutes away. Rooms are nice and staff was quick to help with any requests we had.
50,Thank you for a wonderful stay...Your staff was excellent...All throughout the hotel and Casino. Will be back in the future. We just wanted some hot coffee microwave and a personal use fridge. Thank you.
30,No hot water for shower. be prepared to walk far from the self parking. No valet . Staff not willing to really help just short comments to your questions. No maps of property just kinda left to figure out the area .
50,My wife and I spent the weekend at Mandalay Bay for fun and rest.  During our stay we noticed the resort was very clean and the staff was professional.  They have all of our favorite slot machines  The Strip Steak restaurant was phenomenal. I highly recommend the filet and wedge salad.  The room we stayed in was very clean spacious and had great views.  There is always more to do than we have time for.  The pools are a big hit and also have an adults only pool.  We were very pleased with all that Mandalay Bay has to offer and how nice the resort is.  We will definitely be going back.
50,Very clean place to stay. Had a great time with my family. Beautiful views on the room we stayed at. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Will definitely come back and enjoy another day in paradise and have a great time.
40,I keep coming back that’s good right? For the price it’s a good value for an average strip hotel that’s aged well and doesn’t feel cheap. Rooms are nice bathrooms are nice location is great if you’re not really a strip walker. Easy in easy out. With all the scamdemic procedural nonsense out there if all the unnecessary fear as caused anything it’s the ease of check in and check out. Never saw or talked to a single hotel employee our entire stay. Weird but not bad.  Parking was still complimentary so that was great.
50,I stayed at the Mandalay Bay with my wife and 2 children one week prior to Thanksgiving 2020. The check-in process was efficient and the staff was very nice. They took all the COVID precautions and were enforcing masks for everyone. I got a normal room with two queen beds through a third-party website and only had to pay the resort fee. The pools were still open some of the only pools still open in Vegas at this time. The kids loved the lazy river and the wave pool. The room was spacious and clean. The tub was separate from the shower and was very nice to soak in after a long day of walking the strip. I tried two other strip hotels (4 star and 4.5 star) on this trip and the Mandalay Bay was by far the nicest one. The self parking was free at this hotel during COVID so that was a bonus since we rented a car. Overall this hotel was a great stay.
50,Mandalay Bay is the best hotel in vegas. Beautiful classy great for the family. I would recommend this hotel to everyone. It is my go to vegas hotel. I've stayed here several times and have been extremely satisfied each time.
20,I had prepaid through mlife and paid in full before I checked in and I started another 3 nights and I again went through M life awards and when I got home I checked my account and I had been charged for the room twice and it caused my bank account to be charged for over draft fees of over $200 so I am missing $600 because of them charging me twice for my stay
30,Checked in... Room smelled like marijuana too tired to move ... moved in the morning.... Paid for trip upfront through travel site ... 2 days into trip charged by property again... Paid Full resort fee but access to things were limited (understandable but don’t charge full fee) given room credit for inconvenience
50,Rooms was clean and easy check in process and love how the following safety guidelines they could put free water not charge 9 dollars and 14 for coffee is a little ridiculous but overall it was a good experience
50,I had a great time casino was great food was scrumptious I definitely want to come back At. Rooms were good and clean. They provided social distancing throughout the hotel. Beautiful view also I had a great stay
30,Electronic key only worked for one night - found out the hard way. Room keys kept failing resulting in long trips to the front desk. Staff were not very friendly. Room service was beyond ridiculously expensive. Hotel was dull -- Fremont Street was where the life was.
50,The staff and property at Mandalay Bay never disappoint! The room is always clean and in great shape. The staff is always friendly and helpful. With all the amenities you never have to leave the property.
50,Casino and pool were empty and safety precautions were good. They plenty of masks and sanitation areas. They even had sinks to wash hands inside the casino. The mobile check in and mobile key card were awesome.
10,My husband just returned from a 2 month training rotation and we wanted to spend a couple of days alone without ”breaking the bank”. We were quoted one price when we made the reservation but paid exceptionally more. I called to correct the issue but the management refused to uphold their promised rate.
50,Went for a short vacation. Haven’t ventured to the south side of the strip last few trips. Casino was a great slot experience. Shark reef was above expectation and staff was extremely polite. Will return back if visiting again.
50,My first time ever stay here was GREAT. No issues what’s so ever. Everything was smooth and good. I would easily recommend a friend to get a room here. Reason for this trip was for my girlfriend and I to get away from what’s been going on at home. We needed to treat ourselves and this trip was perfect. Mandalay Bay in my opinion was not only a great stay but a great location. Everywhere we traveled was roughly 10 minutes away and we always had great parking options in the self parking area when we came back.
50,Mandalay Bay is one of my favorite places to stay in Vegas. All mgm resorts are great. But the location and ease of access to rooms restaurants and entertainment at Mandalay Bay makes my Vegas trips better.
50,We love the resort. We have come there the last two years in November. Next visit will be earlier. We do recommend you to all our family and friends. It’s a great place and clean rooms and friendly staff. 🙂
50,My girlfriend and I had a fantastic time!!! The restaurants were great and we loved our room with beautiful views! It was gorgeous and very clean. The whole facility is gorgeous and the employees and servers were outstanding!
50,We love Mandalay Bay Clean big rooms friendly staff quick service beautiful pool heated water a lot of lifeguard convenient and free parking we wish they open their buffet soon we wished if they had microwaves to warm up leftovers.
30,The first night we were there I couldn’t sleep because Our pillows had a very bad odor the next night I decide to call room service to change the pillows and to wait for over 20 minutes and when we walked into the room it had an unusual smell like weed
40,The hotel is very nice. Upon arrival we were greeted by Ron who was super friendly and made sure that our rooms were located next to our travel companions. The rooms were nice - large rooms with great views and comfortable bed/furniture. We had purchased some soda and wanted to be able to keep it cold. Unfortunately the entire mini fridge is only for the hotel items available for purchase. The first night we had dinner at the House Of Blues. The food was good - expensive but good. We did spend one day at the pool - which is amazing! The sand between my toes was awesome! We were disappointed that the regular pools and many of the food outlets were closed - but understandable with Covid.  We stayed for 4 nights and had housekeeping 1 day. The taxi service right outside of the hotel was very convenient. I wished that the tram was available as that would have been so convenient to get to the strip. Casino was fine - not very busy and not much in the way of winnings on the slot machines. We booked our travel package on Priceline.....it included hotel and airfare. Unfortunately when we went to check-out we were charged an unexpected resort fee. We choose this room on Priceline because it did not note a Resort Fee as all of the other rooms did. I looked through the itinerary that I was provided by Priceline and no mention of it their either. Unfortunately the hotel said that we would need to take it up with Priceline because they do not offer hotel rooms without a resort fee. As much as we enjoyed Mandalay Bay it left a bad taste in our mouth - especially the way it was handled.
50,"Stayed at Mandalay Bay at the last minute while travelling through. Got a great last minute deal on a room on the ""58th"" floor with a view of The Strip. The room was clean and we were even provided masks and sanitizer."
50,We had the basic room which was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. I especially loved the soaking tub in the bathroom. All personnel were kind and welcoming. We dined at the Border Grill Burger Bar and Citizens and enjoyed them all. Pandemic precautions were thorough and all the guests seemed reasonably cautious. There was a hand washing station in the casino as well as hand sanitizer dispensers throughout the property and a kit in the room with masks and a tube of hand sanitizer. We had fun in the casino playing slots and actually won a little bit! We are looking forward to returning in the future.
50,Staff was friendly hotel rooms and hotel was very clean. Wish the large pool and lazy river was open. Was told it was at check in then when went down there was told closed. They had 2 small pools open and was very crowded. Room was almost sound proof as you couldn't hear the noise and curtains made sure room was a blackout.
20,Dirty room when I arrived had to get a room change.  Was told I was suppose to get a $50 credit for the room due to the problems we had and never did. Felt like the front desk staff was not wanting to help assist me
50,We stayed 4 nights with our 4 children in joining rooms. Noise was not an issue! Housekeeping did a wonderful job and kept the towels stocked. Beds were comfortable and room space was ample. Will definitely come again!
20,After arriving at the hotel around 9 pm our family went to our room. Room was outstanding! It was clean large view was great bathtub was exceptional. Early morning received a phone call that our car was broken into. Windom smashed and Our kids suitcase and other items were taken.  The hotel sent a security member to check the damage and write a report. That was it! I get technically they're not responsible for items taken so on and ao fourth. However at least seem like you give a damn even if you don't give me a warm and fuzzy so I can be on my way. It's was more like well sucks for you..good luck! That left a sour taste in my mouth.
50,Everyone was amazing. Great service. Good machines lots of fun. Great atmosphere. Everyone was friendly and accommodating. Your governor was the only negative thing about the trip. Stupid mask mandate
40,I felt secured at this hotel as the key only allowed you to the floor your room is on.    My only concern is the rooms are cleaned with only the essential (changing the sheets). There was hair on the blow dryer and there was dust throughout the room.
50,Had a great stay! Room was great nice view quiet location and clean room. We were extremely happy. The casino exercised great caution in social distancing. Too bad a lot of the restaurants were closed but it was understandable.
50,Despite the COVID-19 situation it hasn’t stopped me from enjoying Mandalay Bay you feel safe in this clean and beautiful casino everyone is definitely following the safety procedures no worries here definitely looking forward to coming back.
50,We loved this hotel.  It’s not as busy as the other hotels which was good  We had more space at the tables and machines.  The rooms were brilliant very comfy bed and great bathroom suites.  The staff were amazing at this hotel very helpful polite & genuine people.  I have already booked our next visit...... fingers crossed the vaccine works out 🤦🏻‍♂️😂😂😂
50,Clean! Fancy! Lively environment! Great staff! Good times! I have been coming here for years! And I will continue to keep coming. Love this place. It’s like my second home. I feel very happy & comfortable. :)
50,Mandalay Bay Resort was a beautiful resort. Pulled up to the resort and was met by very friendly bellmen that had useful info on the area. Check-in was easy on smart phone. Business center was very useful and rooms were comfy and nice. Would return again.
50,I love how nice the rooms are really clean! Everyone is nice there. Easy check in and specially if you do mobile check in. Make sure you download the mgm resort app.  The Mandalay Bay and Delano share the same casino. The only thing that sucks there is the parking its super confusing.
40,I had zero problems it was as expected. The room was spacious people were friendly. Morning coffee should be a given at the price. I should be able to use the refrigerator instead of a $50 threat if i use the space. I know your in sales but come on?
50,Everything was wonderful!!! Loved the staff and view of pool!! Too cold to swim. I won a jackpot playing video poker. That was a huge surprise❤️My friend and I will return when the weather warms up.🏝
50,I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Mandalay. The resort itself is very beautiful well kept and clean. To get from the parking structure to the room wasn’t that bad of a walk. Easy check in. The room was very lovely as well. The amount of space was definitely a plus a long with the view!! The bathroom was the icing on the cake private toilet area shower double sinks and a deep garden size tub. The only think that sucked was a very loud alarm went off during the middle of the night for like ten minutes other than that little snaffu everything was great.
40,While clearly they are doing their very best during this COVID pandemic and all safety precautions are being maintained (which I sincerely appreciate!) many of the bars and restaurants were closed. Options were virtually nonexistent.  Also my wife and I traveled with a friend. We tend to play Blackjack. There was usually less than 3 tables and each table only permitted 3 players. Therefore rarely was there 3 “seats” at one table.  I do not want to come off as being critical of the resort. I am sure they are doing the best that they can.  I would also note we arrived on a Wednesday. Things began to pick up on the weekend. Still as we compared Mandalay to say Cosmopolitan or Bellagio on Friday night..... it was like night and day in terms of the latter 2 having many more dining options.
10,I would not recommend anybody to stay here I’m almost noir on my m life currently platinum member and they treated me terrible do no waste your time nor money at the Mandalay Bay you will not have a pleasant stay
10,By accident I had the wrong plates on my new car. My senile father put them on not knowing better. Mgm ran my plates during my stay and turned me into the cops. The cops detained me with handcuffs for an hour at the arco gas station across the street the next day and gave me a ticket. On top of that the hotel is garbage. Don't stay.
30,The fact I have to pay to use the fridge in the room I paid for blows my mind... then on top of that the cost of items in the fridge. The water in the sinks and shower did not get cold which was a scheme in their end in my book all by itself...
40,Everything was great except the extra $18 charge for no reason other than that we would be booking again as long as we don't get charged extra again especially when we don't even drink or smoke and actually clean the room up before we leave
50,Hotel was supper clean staff would sanitize everything during this pandemic. I will definitely book again to this hotel and I have already told friends abt it as well.not to crowed just perfect. Staff is supper friend. Excellent service the location for us was great
10,Mandalay lured all kind of junkies by keeping low prices or likely free room deals - I have never seen this kind of people in 4 star hotel. Screaming yelling swearing drunk and dragged aggressively harassing other guests - no sleep in this zoo. Payed up front for a week stay - moved out after the first night. In addition- TV doesn’t work. Bottle of water in the room - $16.97. Do not get lured - stay away !
50,I have stayed here before and was happy to return again. Excellent service was provided by bell staff concierge casino staff and the spa. Had a small issue with mobile check-in but it was resolved. Will definitely stay here again!
50,The rooms and casino was very clean and felt safe while covid is around. Staff members was polite and helpful the whole trip. Cant wait to visit again. I will be telling everyone about my trip and recommend everyone to stay here.
50,Wasn't sure what to expect in the middle of a pandemic but I was pleasantly surprised that it turned out to feel safer and cleaner than I expected. First time in Mandalay Bay and enjoyed it I'll stay here again.
50,If your looking for a nice and clean hotel this is the place to stay. The rooms are large and the view is amazing. We stayed on the 60th floor and had floor to ceiling window view. You can also use the kiosk to check in so you don’t have to wait forever.
40,COVID is present and not going anywhere soon. Adhere to the properties health and welfare implementations and your Vegas experience will be almost the same as before! MGM has done a fabulous job implementing safety measures for its guests and my spouse and I had a wonderful time.
40,The rooms were nice beds were comfortable and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The only thing is the room was a little dusty and i found a pair of used socks where the blow dryer is kept in the bathroom. It made me feel like it wasnt sanitized how it should have been but thats why i brought Lysol wipes i was planning to rewipe everything down anyways so it wasnt that bad. The walk from the parking garage to the room was kind of a long way but not to bad. We has a great time and i would stay there again.
40,This was my first Las Vegas trip. Decided to stay at the Mandalay Bay. This hotel is beautiful. I had 2 nights comped and 3 nights paid. I had the $50 food and drink credit for the 3 nights paid. I asked if they had any room upgrades available and got one with a high floor (27-221) and a strip view for only $20 extra each night.    The view was absolutely fantastic. You could see the entire strip up to the Trump Tower. A view of part of the airport and a view of the mountains. I turned my chair around to look out the window and would just sit there and enjoy the view. It turned into a fantasy at night. So beautiful with all the lights.    The room was huge. A king bed. A beautiful bathroom with a huge tub and a unattached shower. The toilet was in another room with a door. The only thing I didn't like about the toilet room was it was very small and had no fan.  The bathroom had a double sink and a magnifying mirror.    The room had two comfortable chairs and another desk chair and a table. The bed and pillows were one of the most comfortable I've ever slept on.    It was to cold when we were there to swim but the pools looked clean and relaxing. Didn't really get to see the wave pool or lazy river because it was blocked off.    Walked outside to where all the water fountains are. So peaceful and relaxing in there. Would be a nice way to cool off on a hot day.    I would stay here again. I took it down a notch because we never got cold water in the room and they forgot to take off the $50 food and drink credit on our final bill so I had to call them when we got home. However they did refund us right away. Also I didn't see any mention of a security deposit when booking the room. That I found out about by reading TA travel forums. It takes a long time to get that deposit back when you use a debit card.    All in all I love it was a beautiful hotel. I would stay here again.
30,Did not like the location cost too much cannot use a refrigerator without being charged did not use the coffee pot without being charged absolutely absolutely hated the location cost too much money did not get to use the resort so not sure why we got to pay all those fees
40,Since they are losing so much $$$ from COVID effects machines so tight and no one winning anything. Only 2-3 blackjack tables open at a time so that's about 6-9 spots for the whole casino. I would highly recommend playing elsewhere during COVID.
50,Love the location and the staff that are here! Got a super nice deal and the room was super comfortable! Had a pool view and a soaking bath tub (which comes in most rooms but it was nice!) Will stay here again in the future!
40,Two night stay. They did pretty well with covid protection. Room was fine. Restaurants were open and very satisfactory as well as spaced reasonably. Gaming was severely limited but separation adequate.
50,Mandalay Bay goes out of their way to keep their guests safe and clean had a very good experience there we recommend the pool it was a good time! The food was good and the drinks were excellent! Great value for your dollar
50,Great times in a great place will recommend mandalay to all friends and family. The room was awesome accommodated everyone comfortably. Everyone we encountered was very helpful and kind. Even though it’s during a pandemic we still had a great time
50,Very friendly staff restaurants were amazing casino host was beyond exceptional! Plenty of shopping and everyone in the stores were very attentive. The rooms were clean and very comfortable slept like a baby!
40,First time I stay at the Mandalay Bay. Awesome Place to stay at. We were very pleased with the service provided. We liked the room clean spacious and did I mentioned clean. Shower and tub separate from each other perfect for a bubble bath that I did not take. Now I have a reason to go back again. When you go to Vegas stay at the Mandalay Bay.
50,Love this hotel. Check in was easy we got to upgrade our room it was clean and quiet. Will definitely be visiting again look forward to being able to future experiences with this hotel. Highly recommend!
50,I always enjoy to stay here with Mandalay Bay especially in summer for the pool the lazy river the pool party the mall love it is nice cus you can do 2 other casinos walking don’t need to drive you can be drunk 🤪
20,Our room seemed neglected and lacked maintenance. The living room area rug appeared run down master bedroom restroom sink drain didn’t function properly jacuzzi tub didn’t function living room TV was almost impossible to operate when I would walk through the parking structure with my family the the pungent smell of marijuana was overwhelming. Where was security?
50,I really enjoy staying here! I'm looking forward to the next trip! This hotel is clean and luxurious while maintaining reasonable prices. It has a great location as other hotels are close by and accessible. Also other attractions on the Strip are close by. I will be back for sure!
50,Excellent service hospitality clean room just all around nice stay. All staff was very helpful and friendly. Didn’t have to wait 2 hours for service on the casino floor like other casinos. Really enjoyed the stay.
30,I didn’t feel that the Property take serious measure in taking precautions in regards to preventing the spreading of Covid-19. There was absolutely no temperature check at any entrance to the property except if you’re in line to check in to the hotel. Most venues were closed as well.  I honestly didn’t feel safe. I had to take extra precautions to protect myself and my family during my stay there.
50,Enjoyed the hotel my room was amazing check in was a little alarming but I would stay again and feel comfortable with bringing my family. I recommend this hotel just be prepared to pay to go to Strip.
10,You can get better Wifi and TV service in any third world country hotel!! I spend two days without TV service and when I called guest services they blamed on the provider also wifi is very slow and cuts off constantly.  (did somebody forget to pay the bill) also you can smell weed smog through all the property is very sad to see how low this hotel has gone
20,Very disappointed  The room was not all I had thought  Missing towels  Missing tissues  The coffee water bar was virtually empty  And it was dusty  I am still wondering why they charge resort fees when it’s not a resort  They shuffled copious amounts of people through one sectioned building  Not safe
50,We had our wedding at Mandalay Bay. Very friendly staff Beautiful room and Casino. Variety of food choices. Exceptional customer service. Electronic check in. Budget friendly for how beautiful the hotel is.
50,Would recommend to any and everyone thanks for a great experience. Great selection of slots and table games. Great selection of food and restaurants. Looking forward to my next trip to Las Vegas. Will he back to visit soon and Will be sure to book my reservations in advance.
50,Was very pleased! My Fiancée and I had a great 3 day stay. We have lived here since 2013 and we barley getting out to be local tourists it was fun while it lasted. I would recommend staying at the mandalay bay.
50,We stayed for 4 nights on my first trip to LV. The hotel is beautiful and has many amenities (spa restaurants shops casino pool etc...) and is at the end of the strip. I liked that it was away from the center of the strip. It was connected to the Luxor which was also really convenient because we went to a show there (Carrot Top which was hilarious). Great value for the quality of the resort.
50,My stay at Mandalay Bay was amazing the room was so clean and beautiful and we got a gorgeous view of the strip!!! I will definitely be staying here again on my next trip to Vegas ! My boyfriend was impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel room as well !
50,The Mandalay Bay was one of the best hotels in Las Vegas. It was an awesome stay. The room was extremely clean comfortable and modern. Very spacious suite with a great view. The staff was very friendly and helpful.
50,I've this place netter then some of the other mgm resorts. The rooms were clean and in good condition the staff were amazing. They were so helpful. It had a lot of rood options to choose from. They were there to help whenever u needed it
50,Amid the COVID-19 challenges Mandalay Bay has found a way to elevate their guest experience while finding new ways to keep everyone safe. Everything about the hotel was clean staff was more than helpful and made us feel genuinely welcome. We ate at the House of Blues and the Foundation Room both meals we exceptional. Gambling was fun and the shopping completed our experience. If you have never stated at the Mandalay Bay you should book your next room here. They won’t disappoint!!!
50,Our recent stay at the Mandalay Bay was excellent. The restaurants were open and the gambling was fun. I feel very safe as everything is wide open and there was plenty of airflow. Don’t hesitate to book your trip
50,Our stay was enjoyable. The room was spacious with a nice view. The water is quite hard on the skin however so prepare for dry skin. The experience at the Foundation reminded me of a speak easy. The view was amazing. The service was excellent and food was timely and delicious. I recommend the bass.
30,It was okay....... Nothing horrible average stay. beautiful outside decor..statues fountains etc. The beach pool looks very nice. Only stayed one night In between other hotel stays. Penthouse suite is very roomy.
30,We stayed at Mandalay Bay for five days. When you arrived we were given a room. I am mediately went to take a shower since we just got up. I stepped in the shower without realizing that I was literally stepping into sewage in the water!! Apparently they had turn the water off Or some type of issue but never made us aware. I could not wash it off since I try to use the bathtub and it was the same thing sewage and black. When we went to the front desk and asked to speak to a manager she seemed a little bothered by the hassle But said that she would upgrade our room slightly to a room without a water issue And said we should have been told when checking in. The resolution just did not sit well with me as I have been in the hospitality industry before I just did not feel like that was sufficient Considering I was literally standing at the front desk with sewage all over my body!  The resort is amazing we had a great time all in all but we are coming back to Vegas in April and I really wanted to bring my kids back to us resort as it has the best lazy river wave pool and I did not have to make a reservation due to Covid. Big class but I am hesitant to stay again!
10,"Restaurants are way overpriced. ""coconut"" air fresheners are constantly being pumped into the hotel and casino. Our friend is highly allergic to coconut. We addressed this with the casino staff last time we were in LV staying at the Luxor. But nothing changed. In fact one guy told her it wasn't coconut and he couldn't smell anything! Lamps in the room are cheap and flimsy. Drapes were broken and wouldn't close. A HUGE picture fell off the wall at the entrance to our suite and hit my husband in the head. He had a large bump and small cut and a headache for two days. The staff member that witnessed it while delivering pillows to the suite just asked if he was ok and then said he would tell maintenance. No one ever came to the room to rehang the picture. We tried to purchase tickets to Carrot Top and were told we had to go to the Luxor as Mandalay Bay didn't have access to the tickets. We went all the way over to the Luxor and the box office was closed. And by the way the connecting hall to the Luxor was also ""closed"" and we had to go through tons of hallways behind the displays just to get to the front desk. We are all seniors with health issues and this was a terrible ordeal. When we went to the front desk at the Luxor to ask about the tickets they told us we couldn't get them there and that the box office would open at 6:30 pm. The show was at 8 PM so we probably wouldn't get good seats by then. The ""manager"" then told us we had to go back to Mandalay Bay to get the tickets! No one wanted to help us at all. Not at the Luxor and not at Mandalay Bay. NO one seemed to know what they were doing. And NO ONE cared at all. We felt disrespected and that it was not only age discrimination but also handicap discrimination as we were all in scooters. On top of all of that our friends who also had a room comped got charged for the resort fee of $39 a day plus taxes! WHY? There are absolutely NO amenities now. Only one pool open no valet most restaurants closed ALL of the bars and lounges had NO blended drinks or cocktails at all - they told us they don't have blenders! One of the waitresses said ""to be honest the bartenders find blenders too much work""!!! Are you kidding me? Also the girl at the bell desk (don't remember her name) didn't have a clue what she was doing. When we rented our scooters she charged my friend's bank card FOUR times! As did the front desk clerk when we checked in. She charged her bank card TWICE for the deposit of $400. Because of these extra charges her bank card was blocked! As seniors on fixed incomes this caused a huge problem for their little vacation. Really uncalled for and unnecessary. Made it stressed and uncomfortable instead of the fun time it should have been.Our stay was a huge disappointment. Only reason we didn't leave is because you comped the rooms. I feel the resort fee for our friends should be refunded at the very least!"
40,The hotel and rooms were clean had a cool view of the strip. The check in staff was not friendly they were short and very transactional also location is at very top of strip which is too far up for my liking otherwise good bang for your buck.
50,If you're looking for a great place to stay good food and a wonderful atmosphere this is the place. I stay here all the time and have never had a bad experience. I'm sure you will enjoy your stay just as much as I have if not more.
50,"Wonderful long term stay. Rooms and very large and set up wonderfully even if having to work a day or two. Desk is large and set up so you can not see the hotel beds etc behind you. Casino and staff were all great! Loved taking a break from cold Chicago to relax at the lazy river and wave pool that is surrounded by their ""beach"". Definitely recommend the Mandalay Bay. We will be back!"
40,Love Vegas and getting to experience everything it has to offer. Room was nice perfect for my girlfriend and I just wish it was a little closer to the middle of everything. Very nice over all. I would stay there again .
50,It was a very pleasant stay. Easy check-in just using phone. Clean beautiful room - we had a panoramic suite. It was November but pool was open and it was warm weather. Masks and hand sanitizer are provided and can be conveniently located. Playing machines operate in the way so to observe social distancing (part of machines were off). We visited all open restaurants and the food and service was amazing. We try to stay in isolation and don't usually go out this difficult times however we felt safe in Mandalay Bay. I highly recommend this place. We booked Thanksgiving and New Year at the Mandalay Bay.
50,We enjoy being there. The hotel was very clean and staff were very polite. It was very easy to check in and out. Security made sure everybody had their masks in the casino. The hand washing stations are a great idea and very convenient for everybody to have their hands clean.
20,Although I experienced the worse service. Jackie was amazing. No hotel should charge resort fees during Covid19. I am disabled there was no accommodations for me and without valet it was difficult walking from the parking structure.
20,Booked the Elite King. This is a very nice suite. Large and modern. Plenty of outlets and USB outlets in the room. There is a free-to-use safe. That’s the end of the compliments. There are 5 coffee cups on the dresser with coffee and condiments. I double checked if there is a price and I was told it is $10 per cup. There is no price tag on or near the cups. If used you will be charged $10 per cup. Furthermore five waters are presented with the coffees. Again no price. I was told the water is $16 per bottle. See photos. A sign indicates that if you use the fridge to store your own beverages it is $50 charge. If you move the contents in the fridge even if not taking any minibar contents it is a $50 charge — even of you don’t take anything. I called guest services and was told the fridge is not for personal use.  Put a hold on the credit card for $300 ($100 x 3). Was not told of this before hand nor at check-in.  We have seen dozens of patrons unmasked or not properly masked. We have seen no MB employees correcting the people who cannot seem to comply with masking mandates.  When aircraft are taking off on Rwy 1 or 19 it is plainly heard in our room — every takeoff can be heard above the television.  One store in the hotel would charge us $4.99 for a small bottle of water.  There is a coffee maker but $10 if you use one of the cups in the room no fridge no microwave no drinking water.  Cannot regulate the temperature of the water in the shower. Varies between too hot and way too hot.  We chose MB because we wanted to try a different hotel one where we have not previously stayed.  The Mandalay Bay was a huge mistake.
50,From the website front desk and check in process calling with questions to the nice rooms all the way through to the checkout process; this hotel has got to be the best experience for the price. Everyone was super nice even with the new Covid policies everything seemed very smooth. Plus they gave us some née masks that are the best I’ve used.    All in all a great experience.
20,The check in was great and staff were professional. The casino on the other hand was where we spent the majority of our time during our stay. I visit Vegas several times a year and this visit was by far the worst hands down the casino staff was not accommodating to a health reason for not wearing a mask and would not allow me to be anywhere in the casino without hearing “put on a mask”. How about asking if I can even wear one. On my way out of the door at 4:30am I was harassed by hotel staff to put on a mask. Staff have been beaten apparently until they are so rude about having you put on a mask. I have stayed at many MGM life hotels and am an M life member but I will not be returning to this hotel nor Vegas until the mask mandate is lifted.
40,Brought my mom here for her 58th birthday. Room was clean and our view was nice. I didn’t care for the hostess at The house of blues. We waited over a half hour to be seated for breakfast and we never got called or text that a table was ready and we were starving. Zero compassion from the hostess. We had breakfast elsewhere. Otherwise hotel is nice.
10,Mobile check in didn't work.. somewhat windy but they closed the pool for no good reason.. Room had hair on the welcome card of all places old french fry on the floor shower muddy not cleaned.. sent tweet (unanswered) three calls and they never properly cleaned . Finally they moved to another room with noisy A/C.. They supposedly removed one resort fee(not verified yet)..
50,Went on a solo vacation and it was nice staying at Mandalay Bay.front desk was very friendly and the staff and housekeeping was very attentive .the casino was nice and I will be definitely going back to Mandalay Bay.
50,We stayed at the Mandalay Bay . I was totally impress the hotel is beautiful. Upon check in we were treated with courtesy and professionalism our rooms were ready .The rooms are spacious and clean the beds king size and are super comfortable. And the rooms you have a shower and run lots of closet space . Everything is close by .You have plenty of places to chose to eat .Definitely would stay here again when we come back.
50,We were originally supposed to spend a week in Utah but I had an anxiety attack and we decided to come home early :( Vegas was halfway so we broke up the trip and stayed at this hotel called Mandalay Bay. We walked the strip saw the sights and although we wanted to see Thunder Down Under we still had a fun time without it. The M&M store sucks though — one star. ⭐️
10,Upon my arrival after landing into Vegas they changed my room from Mandalay Bay to the Delano in their lowest room choice. I sat on the phone for 20 min after being hung up on twice. Upon arrival we went to the room is smelled horrid of marijuana I called to find out if the room was smoking and they stayed no. I then went to take a bath and the water in the tub did not get hot at all. The food choices were slim to none. They tell you the food court is open 24 hours that is a lie we walked all the way over and they were closed. House of blues list that they close at 12am we went there at 11 and they were closed along with room service at 11 rooms are nice but I will not stay at this hotel again.
50,My 1st stay in Vegas. I am not a hotel stay type of girl my boyfriend assured me that I would love it & I did. Spacious rooms you really don’t need to leave the hotel. The casino is large with plenty to do
10,I was left on hold when I would cAlll housekeepers never clean our room the bathroom for clogged I has to unclog there  was mold all bathroom I feel disappointed we did not use any amenities I will be contacting bbb for help since hotel manager was to busy to help me
50,The room was clean. Bed was comfortable. Enjoyed using the bathtub. Loved the view of the mountain and pool from our room. The hotel also had masks hand sanitizers and hand washing stations available for guests In the casino.
30,If you live in the eastern time zone don't plan on getting a beer in the am from a bar before 12pm EST! We went to the only bar open at the time and was ignored by the bartender two days in a row! Its Vegas I dont want to wait past noon and have to wait for a cocktail server to get a drink! Im willing to pay 40+ for 2 drinks! Come on Mandalay Bay its Vegas! Take my money! I think next time Ill try Fremont street!
30,I love this hotel and have returned at least 10 times since it has opened but this last trip has convinced me that I should move on. Recently I booked an upgraded room with a king size bed. Arriving late and checking in I noticed the shower was scalding hot. Rather than bothering anyone I waited til morning. The next day my husband who loves hot showers said it was scalding hot and there was no way to turn it down so I called in the front desk to complain and to add that the basin did not provide any hot water and the shower and tub was scalding hot.    An engineer cam in to bleed the water pipes and it seemed to do the trick after 20 minutes. However that evening we experienced the same scalding hot situation. After trying to simulate what the engineer we were unable to get the cold water to feed the shower or the tub so I asked for a room change.    It was quite late and they finally moved us to realize the next day the management downgraded us to a smaller room. After this and having been inconvienced I decided the Mandalay is having difficulties maintaining their property and is now providing less than adequate service.
50,Clean room slept great nice set up didnt like the travel to the self parking from the rooms vice versa other than that id definitely stay again easy check in and out  Customer service energy pleasant
50,Our stay was great. The hotel wasn’t very busy and everyone stayed a decent amount of feet away from everybody. House of Blues has the best food and atmosphere. Ashley at house of blues is amazing. MGM Hotels have done an amazing job with managing operations during a pandemic.
40,Good customers service. Clean. Fast and efficient service. Only one bad thing the smoke of some customer lingers on to other place. I hate cigarette smoke. Don't mind vape but ciggarette is no no no.
40,Great place to stay! Very friendly staff! The pools are amazing! Definitely check out their 2bdrm suites. We rented a cabana at the pool and it was fantastic having a host and a server there when we needed them.
30,We arrived a little after 3:00 and had to wait until 7:00 to get into the room. The guy delivering our fridge first let us in. After asking and waiting they told us it was because a chair needed cleaned and was drying. Once we got in there was no sign of this. They later brought us our keys but really didn’t do anything to make it right other than apologizing. We asked for a late 3:00 pm check out which they didn’t give us. Very disappointed with the customer service and check in process. Other than this the hotel is great and the pool is nice.
40,Overall very clean hotel and accommodation is good. I don’t like the fact the toilet was dirty but other than that it was fine. They let me park at the hotel garage for 22 days without any charge so that itself was a great value for me
50,Like I Said RoomCasinoPool AreasVery CleanBut Nothing Open& When It Was It Was Closed EarlyVery Little StaffHad 2 Wear 😷At All Times But I”NEVER”Saw Anyone Cleaning MachinesEscalatorsDoorsElevatorsetcetcSort Of Like HypocrisyFood At Citizens Expensive Had Breakfast Omelette & Toast Extra!!!& $4.50 4 A Cup Of Coffee🤬🤬🤬House Of Blues Extremely Better Value& $12.00 4 A Cup Of Coffee N RoomEven At”MOTEL 6 IT’S FREE”🤔🤔🤔Ud Do Better 2 Not Nickel & Dime Us2 ⚰️⚰️⚰️I’ve Been Going 2 Casinos Downtown Since The 1950s With My Parents & They Don’t Nickle & Dime U To⚰️⚰️& There Still Profitable & InexpensiveAftef 70+ YearsJust A 🤔🤔🤔🤔.
50,Our room was perfect! the bed was very very comfortable large room. The bathroom had a deep tub and separate shower with great water pressure. A great view of the Las Vegas Strip. And a verity of places to eat.
30,Stayed at Mandalay Bay for four nights. 2 days no water had to use the Fiji water that was in the room just to brush my teeth. Housekeeping only cleaned the room one day. Will not stay there again. Resort fee wasn't waved for all nights
40,I would hope that with MGM Rewards that I have a profile on file that Mandalay Bay would View before selecting my room; I find it aggravating that no cross checks are done from visit to visit. I don’t mind changing rooms however I do appreciate the remedies that are offered but sometimes the remedies don’t equate the inconvenience of moving rooms. The first time I stayed here I spent the majority of my vacation changing rooms; Not Good
50,It’s was a covid bday stay everything was clean beautiful and amazing I wish I could have stay more days even the pool area was great mask was in force every where in the hotel casino was clean and the food was amazing
20,We were really excited to come back to the Mandalay Bay because we were very impressed with our stay 10 years ago. We come to Vegas often and have enjoyed our stays at various other hotels on the strip but we were sorely disappointed with our most recent stay at the Mandalay Bay. We stayed in a king suite it was lackluster. The bathroom was nice and bed comfortable but the room could use an upgrade. There were eye lashes in the sink and random styrofoam bowls and solo cups in the cabinets which make me question their cleaning quality. We have been traveling throughout this Covid Pandemic and have been impressed with how various locations have handled it. Disney World’s implementation was impressive as they followed and enforced strict protocol BUT also provided great customer service and a wonderful experience UNLIKE the Mandalay Bay. It was a very impersonal experience with lots of rules but absolutely no customer service. They made it almost impossible to spend money or have a good time. Our room was not available at check in at 3:00pm. The staff was cold impersonal and not very helpful. I was not impressed and will not be back.
20,Stayed 9 nights in a one bedroom penthouse with my girlfriend. The room nice clean and beautiful. Staff at check in seemed like they would have rather been unemployed collecting the stimulus money still. Long wait times. Location of hotel is miserable. Staff wasn’t friendly. M-life just gave constant problems. Just all in all... wouldn’t stay here again. Better hotels in Vegas to stay at
10,The room was not clean for my 3-night stay the wait at restaurants to get service is of at least 30 minutes. I found hair in my food they just replace the part where the hair was the waiter did not even say sorry
50,we went for three days it was great friendly staffgood servicefree parking and the beach pool area was awesome. i do recommend a penthouse suite lots of room to hang out and enjoy a few drinks before you go out.
50,This is a great place to relax as well as get in on the action. The hotel and casino were always very clean and I saw every surface being cleansed. I would highly suggest The Mandalay Bay on your next Vegas trip.
30,Being charged to use the refrigerator is the craziest thing I’ve encountered at a hotel. They filled the fridge with their items hoping you’ll use it so they charge you.  Being unable to use a simple fridge was such A turn off. Otherwise the hotel was beautiful. Far away from the strip but close to the airport.
50,Beds were amazing and spacious room  Staff was friendly and helpful  Shower and bath was great  Room was very clean  Room stayed cool and comfortable  Great location will be staying here again  Would recommend to anyone
50,We wanted to stay on the strip but didn't want to be in the middle of it all so this choice was perfect at the far south end. Our 59th floor room faced the strip which was a fantastic view. The hotel also connects to Luxor which was a bonus.    The room was spacious and very clean. We stayed in a Stay Well room which had extra air purifiers and aromatherapy very nice.    The hotel was quiet and even the casino was very low key compared to so many others. If you are looking for quiet refinement I think this is a good choice. The pool area was also lovely but due to COVID mostly closed and with masks but that could not be helped at the time.
50,We got the media suite it was incredible! I wish we would have gotten some instruction on how to use all of the features but it was still awesome. We will get this room again next time we are in Las Vegas.
10,16$ for a bottle of water in the room and 10$ for coffee? Motel 6 offers free coffee. I had a king suite and had to pay for coffee and water. Price gouging at its worst and the opposite of customer loyalty. Tables were all full and refused to open any more as several of us were trying gamble which is why we came and why Vegas exists.
20,Water was off 2 days of my stay due to maintenance there was no courtesy call to inform me that the water would be off I wasn’t put in another room to accommodate us and those days wasn’t waived as they promised they only waived one resort fee from my stay
30,I choose this place for the pool such a great lazy river and wave pool. But the fridge in the room really upset me I can understand not taking anything out of the fridge or be charged but you also can’t put anything in the fridge I am a breast feeding mom and I poured a lot of breast milk down the drain because you simply can’t use the fridge in your room unless you want to pay $50. Also nowhere on-site to warm up your food late night so anything you have leftover hopefully it will taste good cold because you won’t be able to heat it up later.
30,It was nice around the pool area. The pool staff were doing a lot of complaining about masks but they weren’t wearing them. The restaurants in the pool area were not open on a Friday and Saturday so you had to leave for lunch and that was inconvenient.
50,Fantastic hotel. Great staff. Smells clean. The bathroom shower door was difficult to open. It was super clean though and the bed so comfortable. Will def be there again soon. Need comp rooms for more trips!
50,We enjoyed our stay but it would have been very nice to lay in the sun with our masks off since no one was any closer than 10 feet to us but they had people offering masks and reminding everyone to use then if they were not in the water.
50,Always amazed when staying here. Rooms casinos restaurants are always so clean & staff is always friendly. Even though times are different with COVID I felt they were doing an amazing job to keep everyone safe! Love the location & took advantage of free parking.
30,The hotel was nice and clean. The check in staff were extremely helpful and nice. However all the rooms are all next to eachother and if you want to play music and dont have friendly vegas vibing neighbors they’ll call security on you.
30,Water did not work for first 2 days. We complained on several occasions that we had been unable to shower. Only response was to move us to a much lower floor and “refund” the resort fees. I checked out Monday and 2 days later I have still not received a receipt from my trip.
40,As a Vegad local took advantage of the cheaper Sunday and Monday weekdays. All money well spent Great Service Exceptional Amenities....However looking for decent priced food? Dont plan on always eating here...even the food court is outrageously overpriced. Aside from that all in all great place to stay and isolated spot on the Strip for better privacy.
10,The room started out nice when I arrived but that soon turned bad. While trying to take a shower the shower hand came completely off and I was unable to shower. report it to the front desk and it wasn't fixed until the next day. After it was fixed then the lights in the bathroom stopped working. I had to leave the door to the toilet open because that was the only light working. The water for some reason lost pressure and then there was no water.  I want out for the evening on the last night of my stay and when I got back to my room not only did house keeping not clean my room but the floor next to the closet was soaking wet like there was a flood in my room while I was gone.    Then when I complained I was only credited $30 for all the trouble I had with your hotel. NOT ONE person in your hotel showed up in person to apologize for the inconvenience concentering all the trouble I was having with the room.    I hope that explains my 0 rating for your hotel. I wouldn't recommend your hotel to anyone I know!
20,Lovely hotel but it’s size makes customer service really poor. You’re just a $$. Staff is generally polite but always on the defensive fixing hotel issues. It’s my second Comp visit due to past problems and they just can’t seem to do better. Disappointed.
50,Best place in Vegas to take your kids! You don’t even have to leave the property. Plenty to do very clean less crazy than the main area of the strip. We got a great deal due to the time in which we stayed so it was worth every penny. It felt really safe which was important as I was traveling alone with my 9 year old son. The resort is so fun and we loved it.
50,Great hotel with everything you need in one location. Close to the airport and new Raider stadium. Great food great bars service and Starbucks for those who need this daily fix. One of the best pool and beach areas in Vegas.
50,This is a awesome place to stay Hotel & Casino are very clean The rooms are very nice and comfortable. The whole staff here are very friendly. Would definitely recommend this Hotel & Casino to everyone . I will definitely be back soon.
50,Loved the soaker tub! Didn’t have time for spa but tub made up for that! Room was clean and great covid bag with masks hand sanitizer key and door opener was PERFECT! Late checkout was reasonable as well.
10,Do not stay here on Friday/Saturday. They have their outdoor nightclub with a DJ until 2 am and you can hear the music DJ and loud bass in the rooms. Customer service did nothing to help. They hung up on me when I asked about it.
20,The bed in our room was extremely uncomfortable!!! Waited for bell service for 15 minutes and never got help. They do not have carts that guests can use to get their own things to their rooms. We carried our own bags through the very large hotel and down a very long hallway to our room.
10,I like amenities at Mandalay Bay (pool wifi). My room smelled like pot because the people in the room next door were smoking. The floor stunk light pot. The parking garage smelled like pot. The location is on the south end of the strip close to airport. The casino floor is spacious and clean. My negative review is because of the pot stench so if that is your thing you won’t have an issue.
50,We had a larger group of family that wanted to get away. We chose Mandalay bay because of the pools and size. We were really impressed with the rooms we love the pools and the place is large enough that you don't have to gamble by anyone. Made social distancing easy and they are always cleaning.
10,Weekday cheaper the Friday Saturday. Even weekdays nickel and dime you. Every request is a charged upgrade. Strip views costs more . Higher floor cost. Coffee and water in room big charge. Your $44 resort free includes one pool but not a padded chair  umbrella or drinking fountain or lazy river float. Breakfast starts at 11am?! No free water.  Deep end of pool closed.  Takes five minutes for front desk to answer phone. Sheets not changed unless you ask.  Hot tub closed. Avoid this price gouging rip off at all costs.
20,Room was not finished being cleaned(needed to be vacuumed water softener refil was emptycoffee stain on the sink) But had TERRIBLE customer service by the MANAGER. He just gave me attitude when I told him about this and said there was nothing he could do.
50,The Mandalay Bay was a nice clean resort and casino. From the moment you walk through the door to the time you enter your room everything is clean and sanitized for your protection. When you do get to your room there is a strip on the door letting you know that it has been cleaned and sanitized. The room itself is very clean.
50,Mandalay Bay was great. Wasn’t crowded like the rest of the strip. Room was clean and big. Check in process was smooth. Workers were friendly. Parking was kind of confusing the first day but we followed the directions and found our way.
40,I picked this hotel because of my two toddler. They enjoyed the pool and aquarium. However having toddlers with you means you will have leftovers especially if one of your kids have allergies. I’m disappointed that there is NO mini fridge that we can use because you will be charge $35/day if the content/weight of their minibar is altered. I had to use the ice bucket to keep my son’s oats milk cool. If it wasn’t for the pool or shark reef I would think twice before booking in the near future.
50,They have the best rooms very clean and the most comfortable beds! We stay there for the weekend and my husband and I were so pleased with everything at Mandalay that we are planning another trip to Las Vegas very soon!
50,We enjoyed our stay very much. The room was beautiful clean comfortable and modern. The lobby area is very nice with tables comfy chairs and a beautiful view of palm trees and fountains. Our favorite is the House of Blues restaurant and gift shop. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Great location also. Can’t wait to return.
30,Our room was so awesome yet we had no Running water in check out no one called or Advices is of this and had to drive home with out a shower or any thing for our family definitely was disappointed about our trip
30,It was an okay stay. Not any attractions at this hotel. Didn’t see much on Halloween weekend. There was loud noise coming from some of the rooms. The phone inside hotel room didn’t work and also the channels on the tv wouldn’t work as well either. Overall score was an average 8. I was hoping for better. Plus check in was a nightmare.
10,I had to walk through a puddle of water that was 5 feet wide and 2 inches deep to get to my hotel room. Later that night I was unable to get back to my hotel room because the elevator to the 30th floor was not working. The next day when I was leaving the water did not work in the bathroom. I walked down the hall puddle still there this time holes cut in the ceiling and water draining into a 55 gallon garbage can whith blowers trying to dry out the carpet only the blowers were blowing the water all over the place so you got wet. When I asked at the front desk about all this nonsense there was no compasion regarding the situation and the worst part nobody could confirm it wasn't waste water flowing from the ceiling. I will NEVER stay here again and quite possibly never at an MGM resort! Worst hotel EVER!!
50,Restaurants variety is highly recommended pool is amazing and the staff were helpful in every department we used.away from the strip for walking distance especially train is not available. Check in and out is so easy and convenient.
50,We stayed in a two bedroom panoramic suite on the 20th floor and it was amazing! We had a few of the pools and the new raiders stadium and I can’t say enough about how beautiful the property at Mandalay Bay is! We will definitely stay again soon!
10,We had no water for 2 days of our 4 day stay without notice. For hours on end. The resort just cut the water off without saying anything. And when we did say something we had to beg to be compensated.
50,First time at Mandalay Bay and it won't be our last. Friendly service and great amenities. Lots of options very dinning and the pool area was amazing. Parking was easy and so was the check-in and check-out.
50,The room was large and very clean with a great view! The pool and beach were AMAZING! The shops and restaurants were fantastic! The hallways smelled terrific. It was an overall great experience. We will for sure be back again!
50,Hotel is really nice with great amenities friendly staff and a very large casino. Didn't feel like the quality dropped at all in light of the pandemic which was great. Virtually all restaurants/bars were open at least on certain nights. Would stay here again (and plan to on my next Vegas trip).
40,Mandalay Bay is coping fairly well with the Covid epidemic. The hotel is trying to maintain a fairly high standard even though its occupancy must be between 20-40%. Some of the restaurants were closed all the pools stayed open table games were limited. The rooms were very reasonably priced while maintaining a high standard.
30,My friends and I had planned on spending time in Vegas back in December 2019; then the pandemic hit and every plan everyone made went by the waste side. In September 2020 it looked like Las Vegas was opening back up a little so decided to move forward with my trip. It had been over 10+ years since I had last been Vegas so I did not know the best place to stay location etc. My friend had been to Vegas many times and enjoyed staying the Four Seasons which is on the top 4 floor of the Mandalay Bay; so I decided to stay at the Mandalay Bay so that way we could all just meet in the lobby if we wanted to go anywhere. It was easy to book the room on the Mandalay Bay website but the prices kept changing so I constantly had to check back and forth to get the best rate; luckily all the rates booked were able to be cancelled and refunded as all rooms required a deposit (which they did charge to the credit card at the time of the booking). Each rate included access a resort fee which included certain perks which I will detail below. It was not easy to modify or manage the booking online and any changes needed to be made by calling the hotel which required pushing too many buttons and being on hold for too long.    The hotel is located at the end of the strip and there is a grand entrance - there are two entrances one to the casino and one to the resort. Also there are two hotels connected to the resort - the Mandalay Bay and the Delano (as well as the Four Seasons); its one big maze not a lot of signage and lots of confusion. The check-in desks were located at the end of the lobby and there was long roped off area in which to line-up for the check-in desks – like a check-in line at the airport. The type of service received at check-in depended on which representative you received – some were good at providing details while others only provided the basic information; at check-in I only received the basic information but at check-out I received all the information some of which would’ve been helpful at the beginning. I checked received the key and proceeded to my room. Regarding Covid-19 protocols there were markers placed on the floor to remind guests to social distance while in line but this was not enforced and it was left up to each individual to their discretion. There were also masks and sanitizers stations placed each door entryway.    There were different elevator bays depending on which floor your room was located and each bay had about 8 different elevators so in theory it would be easy to social distance given there is a lot of option; however again it was left upto the individual to make this decision as the hotel did not provide any guidance or signage regarding this fact. My room was on the 11th floor and as you get in the room was bigger than I expected. As you walk inside the door you walk down a mini-hallway to get to the room. The room has two beds against the right-side of the wall and along the left was a desk connected to a chest with drawers on the bottom coffee-maker and paid bottle water on top and then a mini-bar below (which was weight sensitive so even if you picked it up and put it back down it automatically charged to the room). Against the opposite wall were the two beds which were large comfortable and provided a good night’s sleep; again the bed and sleep quality was better than I expected. In the middle was a nightstand with a lamp and outlets and there were outlets on either side of the beds (which was convenient. One wall was covered with windows which allowed for lots of light to come inside – and our view was of the airport which was great for an aviation lover as you could see (but not hear) planes take off all day. The entrance to bathroom was located next to the beds and there were individual closets on either side of the bathroom entrance. The bathroom was huge and again bigger and better than I expected. There were double sinks with lots of counter space a full jacuzzi tub a shower and a covered toilet. There were also plenty of toiletries including soap lotion shampoo conditioner and towels and if you requested more tons were provided. Overall it was a spacious and comfortable hotel room with plenty of room to move and rest.    As it was a resort there were plenty of amenities for guests to enjoy including many pools business center shows an aquarium restaurants casinos spas and a man-made beach inside the resort. Because of the 'resort' status the hotel included a daily resort fee which covered internet local calls and other non-essential items; to me and reviewing what was part of the fee it was a fee that was designed to gain more money from the guests as it covered nothing and guests were still being charged for other items. The resort did include complimentary wifi but the wifi was open to everyone so there was no need for a login so again not sure what the fee was good for? The resort did include many pools a man-made beach and lots of cabanas for guests to enjoy (these were not included and had to be paid for). Because of the pandemic certain cabanas and chairs were not utilized and staff went around asking guests who were not in the pool to keep their masks on - so that was a pleasant point.    Overall it was a mixed experience at Mandalay Bay. The rooms were nice spacious and comfortable so that was on the plus side; there were also many amenities for the guests to enjoy so that was also positive; negative was that customer service was not great the resort fee seemed inconsequential and there was a lack of signage and direction (it was not well laid out). The size of Mandalay Bay was large and if comparing it to a Disney Resort or a resort in the Caribbean it was less organized and less friendly - so why go to Vegas if I could get the same thing elsewhere?
50,Very relaxing. Spacious rooms. Very conscientious with Covid. Enjoyed the pools. We desired to be at the end of the strip to allow for spacing. It would have been nice if tram would have worked though.
20,My husband & I stayed here for 3 nights. Room was great. Check in sucked because we were told we had a balance of $132 for resort fees that was not told to us when we booked package. Also 2 of the 3 nights the next room was playing loud music and generally partying. Called front desk both nights (about 3am) not much done about it.
50,Thank you for the  great service. Our family enjoyed our stay. The hotel room was very clean. There was no problems with the service. The restaurants are very nice. The activities are also nice. The shark reef was a very beautiful experience
50,The whole experience was awesome. The room had the prefect view and the staff was amazing. The room was clean and was provided with mask to keep safe. Will book with them again. Bath was bomb as heck!
20,At check in my room was dirty and after reporting I was told cleaning is done on a schedule. It was cleaned the next day. I plan to visit Vegas again but will not be staying here. For the money that charged I was expecting a better experience
50,Had a great time at Mandalay Bay! The pool was great and the rooms were a deal. The wave pool and lazy river were open but the other pools were not. The main stay restaurants for almost all Strip locations are closed. There is still very good shopping locations north and south of the Strip.
30,I arrived at 8PM on a Tuesday night and was told the only place open for dining was the House of Blues. After unpacking I walked there and it was locked up. I asked a security guard where I could get something to eat in the hotel and he suggested I go across the street (Las Vegas Blvd!) and there was a Subway that was open. And for this I was paying a $45 a day resort fee.
20,The property had a pipe burst and one day we had no hot water for a couple of hours and the next day there was no water at all for a couple of hours while they fix the pipes. Of course when I had to go to my reservation I was late because I had to wait for the water to turn on.
10,This was a horrible experience. We have had NO WATER for two days. I thought it would be a great idea to stay here but this Halloween has been a NIGHTMARE!!! When I called the front desk they stated there is simply nothing they could do. Disgusting.
50,Great place to stay. Get the strip view turn off the lights in the room and enjoy your views of Sin City! Best bang for buck hotel on the strip with good restaurants down stairs. I always look to stay at Mandalay Bay
10,Poor and unknowledgeable service at check in and over the phone. Very poor room cleanliness: dirty toilet seat pubic hair found in bath tub and multiple finger prints on inner part of windows. Had to change hotels. Overall disturbing and concerning stay.
50,The best pool in Las Vegas is definitely at Mandalay Beach. I’ve stayed at almost every Las Vegas property and I’d have to say if you intend on being at the pool most of your stay Mandalay Bay is the place to stay.
10,Had to park at Excalibur (1.5 miles away) because Jeep was too big for their garage. Assured safe our $800 bike was stolen. Management handled the situation very rudely. We were really looking forward to our 1st ever trip to Las Vegas was completely ruined and it could have been salvaged by the managements handling of the situation.
30,Rooms was spacious. Covid precautions were good. All my family got masks and sanitizer in their rooms I didn't. No biggie cause I brought my own. Beds and pillow very comfy. Hug tub was nice. Mobile check in wasn't as efficient as I had hoped it would be.
50,This Hotel was the bomb upon arrival the bell hoopers were nice and helpful my room check in time was appromately at 3pm but we arrived at the hotel at 11am so they said the room would be ready in 25mins to check in so they notified us that our room was ready they handed us our room keys and we got on the elevator which was very nice and shining then checked into our room which was nice and very clean .The bed was nice and comfortable and the bathroom was marvelous as well I'd definitely stay back there again nextime.
50,Great time with the family the stay was comforting and adventurous. The entire place was clean and everyone was wearing mask. Food and drinks were superb while the pool side experience was unforgettable!
20,My girlfriend and I wanted to take a overnight trip to Las Vegas and after a lot of searching and researching to decide where to stay base on our budget we decided on Mandalay Bay because we really wanted to play in several small buy in tournaments (we haven't played in a tournament for 7 months due to the pandemic).  Can you imagine our disappointment when we got here to find out that the poker room was closed and yet on your website it still says that you have 3 daily tournaments.  We would have thought that all casinos would keep their website up to date even after you closed the poker room several months ago!  We were able to find a tournament but only played once since the buy in was higher than what we wanted so we had to spend more for ride share to get to the casino for the tournament.  Also we both are deaf and once we got back to our room I wanted to watch TV and found out that I can't get the close captions to work. You have a brand new Samsung TV but using an old universal remote and when I press the CC button a selection of music shows up.  We had some frustration with the digital key to use the elevator and ended up getting a card key.  Seems like nothing was going well for us
50,I love it here and clean rooms along with great customer service.I had no problem getting my room it was a last minute reservation and took maybe the longest of 10 minutes before my room was ready and very accessible as well.
50,I recommend Mandalay Bay to anyone who wants to have fun either as a single person or as a family. Mandalay has the ability to manage a safe and clean stay for their guess and employees throughout the COVID-19 pandemic
20,Room was dirty . Staff stated they would address but didn't follow through . I get we are dealing with virus and short staff and 50 percent occupancy but if your going to be open then place should be extremely clean.
50,Great locationvery clean friendly staff and good food. Hotel with lazy river and wave pool made for a great stay to get away from all the strip crowds. When we return we will definitely be staying here again.
30,It was decent. When I entered into the room I had to request additional attention because my room was not properly cleaned. Initially they only offered a $50 food credit that expired once you checked out.
30,Minor maintenance issues floors in rooms need more attention. Hotel overall is showing signs of wear and tear. Price point for rooms is not accurate for what you get. Beds are very soft which is uncomfortable in my opinion
30,I like the hotel I stayed there last year also but this year they seemed to be price gauging you everywhere you turned from room service to sports book to the restaurants. DO BETTER MGM!! The only good thing was they offered free parking...
20,Just below average right now. Did not feel any staff went out of the way to make it a good experience. They only great time was in the adult pool area when we rented two cabanas for Sunday. This was the only part that was enjoyable.
50,There has been a bit of craziness in Vegas lately however I've yet to experience anything of that nature staying at this property - and I've stayed at least once a month since June. Will be back again next month.
50,Our room was very clean quiet and an excellent value. I would definitely stay here again. Love the easy on easy off interstate location. I have zero complaints. We are at the Casnio and had a wonderful meal!
40,Guest were not consistently wearing facial covers... No maximum elevator directions were provided. The staff was appropriate. Some simple reminders would be helpful. Overall the stay was ok.also of note the in room dining the table cloth was perfect . The actual table was disgusting... The details are everything.
50,I love coming here. Everything is clean and well taken care of. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. I liked the fact that it wasn't as packed especially these days. I went to meet a friend over at Cesar's and it was so packed over there that I had to leave. I always enjoy staying at Mandalay Bay!
50,Wonderful customer service and very clean and well kept and updated rooms! And the casino game choices was great as well as food options and the pool is top of the list for Vegas. Especially the wave pool and real sand.
50,We decided to take a trip for my daughter's birthday to Vegas and stayed at the Mandalay Bay. It is a beautiful hotel with very clean and spacious rooms. They have an amazing pool area with cabanas multiple pools a lazy river wave pool and a pool for little kids. They also had a lot of restaurants to choose from and the parking garage was clean as well. Overall we were very happy with our stay and would recommend the Mandalay Bay to everyone.
10,I broke the seal on the room and was expecting a very clean room only to find mildew in the airvents and urine on the toilet seat. I notified management they promised to have it taken care of when I returned there were garbage bags in my room. I asked them to come collect them they moved them from the hallway onto the bathroom sink I called over three times and they would never come get them. They told me to go buy dinner at one of the very few open restaurants and they would take care of it and they didn’t. Very few places are open in this hotel there were only two places to choose from for breakfast and neither were particularly appealing
50,My first time staying at MB was well worth it. The front desk gentleman was very nice and professional. He accommodated my room when I was for a view of the new stadium. It is very clean and beautiful inside.
50,Staff was very friendly and helpful. Your temperature is taken at registration. Everything was extremely clean and sanitized. There is also hand washing and hand sanitizing stations throughout the casino. I will definitely be staying here again.
30,It was okay over all. Doubt id go back. Clean rooms no problem there. Gambling sucked. Lost 200 bucks in the first 30 mins. 1000 over all. I dont expect to win 1000’s but at least have fun playing. Bought a drink at the bar for 25 bucks and 4 beers cost 40. Pretty pricey.
10,Not a hotel I would recommend. Unfortunately the customer service made the whole Experience really bad. I had nothing but issues since I checked in I had to move two different times. Too bad because it’s a nice
30,Rooms only cleaned if specifically requested and when we did they didn't show. No final bill so we still have no idea about how they arrived at the final amount. The pools were great and what few restaurants were open were good. Hotel was slammed on the weekend so hard to get seating.
30,Management was not willing to accommodate after the problems we experienced with the 2 rooms I reserved. They rather give me a food credit and downgrade my rooms instead of upgrading us or giving us comp rooms for another stay.
10,Made spa reservations that we ended up forgetting about. They gave no refund or discount on a future service. Absolutely rude and horrible business tactic. We own our business and could never get away with doing that to a customer.
10,My spouse and I made a reservation for my birthday celebration. When our trip was ending I left the hotel and arrived at the airport I noticed that I had left my passport in the hotel room. The airport personnel advised me to call your hotel and ask for my passport to be shipped otherwise if I missed the flight I would have to wait for the next flight on our airline which was only on Friday several days later. I called the customer service of your hotel only to be kept on the line for a long time and then transferred to multiple different people. All I needed was to get a simple yes or no. Multiple hotel staff members hung up on me and I was unable to reach any of your staff after that. However I could quickly reach someone when I called the number to book a room. I told them about my situation again and asked if they could help me with sending me my passport or I would try to come back to hotel to get it and try to catch my flight. As a response I was told by your personnel that this was not in their responsibility wherefore I must be transferred to “lost&found” department which was to my disappointment nothing but an automated voicemail telling me to fill out a form. I called again and this time they told me that I could catch my flight if I could come to hotel to get my passport. While I was busy trying to reach your hotel to get an answer my luggage was already checked in. I got a cab and rushed to the front desk where I was told to wait for the line despite my urgency. When I was finally attended to I was told to go to the security department which was at the other end of the hotel. I did as I was told went to the security office where I was told to go to the front desk! I rushed to the front desk again and I was told yet again to wait in the line. As I wanted to avoid any disturbance before your customers I tried to deal with the situation calmly. But I was adamantly told to wait in the line and they could do absolutely nothing about that (despite the fact that I was told that it was better for me to come to the hotel). By the time anyone could be bothered to help me I had already missed my flight. And because of all that I was too tired to try to find another place to stay. So I had no choice but make another reservation. Following that I was immediately provided with the key of the room that I forgot my passport in and given a new room key for the room I had to pay for. As I had no chance to be late for the work I obtained another flight from another airline at 05:00 a.m. for the next day.    Forgetting my passport falls within my responsibility. But having me run around without any clear response lack of due attendance to your customers failure in providing any kind of assistance and thereby causing my situation to go even worse fall within your responsibility and indicate gross negligence and irresponsibility on behalf of your hotel. If your staff could have managed to assist me without causing any unnecessary hustle to provide any clear answer to provide me the key instead of keeping me in the line despite knowing my urgent situation or at least if they could simply say “yes we could ship it or we cannot.” in the first place instead of keeping me on the phone line and then hanging up on me I could have caught my flight without any problem. Because of your negligence costing me at over an hour you have made an extra income thanks to me whereas you cost me an extra USD 750 between the new flight and additional night in the hotel.    Even throughout our first stay we were not able to sleep because of all that “partying” and noise of the other customers of yours. At my next accommodation I could not even use the bathroom because it was not even cleaned it was full of black hair from a stranger. My experience with your staff already taught me that trying to contact your hotel via phone is pointless. So I am writing you through here.    Kindly note that you made your customers feel cheated. Your staff cost me a great effort a big loss and sorrow.
40,My stay was Just ok for the price... not a big deal no extras they should be cheaper or no resort fees since not everything is operational during this time went during october which was still covid time during quarantine of 2020
30,Confusing at check-in rooms are outdated and why did you wear a mask at the pool😷 I’m never going to do thatAnd they still charge resort fees first off you’re never going to use all I wanna do is get in your pocket like every other resort
20,No tables available when the others were full and min bet was ridiculously high. No restaurants were open. No shows. Why even open if your just gonna open 2 sub par restaurants. Snack bar was open...yay. heavy smell of cigarettes and weed throughout the property
50,This was our yearly couples trip to Vegas. With COVID we did not know what to expect. However everything was very clean comfortable staff was very helpful and friendly as usual. We had not worries and had lots of fun. Despite shows still not up and running and a couple of our fav. restaurants still closed it was still a very fun and relaxing trip for us.
40,This is the first time i had to pay for coffee at a hotel  Even cheaper motels offer complimentary coffee. What’s the point of paying the resort fee?  I will definitely choose a different resort in the near future
10,The staff and management did not care to resolve any issues. They allowed other guest to fill the hallways with the smell of weed including the room directly beside us. Our room was set to 67 and still didn't cool. Charges on our bill that wasn't ours! Offered credits and then never issued them. Valet sent us to wrong place in a taxi and we got stuck with a $25 taxi fee.
50,Everything was perfect! We had a room with a view of the strip from the 56th floor. The pool was not crowded and the water was warm. The staff was kind and my room was clean! Over all we enjoyed our stay at Mandalay Bay! I would highly recommend staying here!
50,Staff was very friendly and helped with our stay as we had a service animal. Staff was informational to food stairs elevator and times things were open. Room was amazing and clean. Our view was great.
30,Hotel room could have been cleaner we were woke up several times at night due to loud noise and our room and hallway frequently smelled like marijuana. Hotel staff was very professional. Pool area was great.
40,The hotel was wonderful. Great check in experience and recommendations on things to try. Very clean and sanitized in all the areas that i went to. Far surpassed my Covid cleanliness expectations from other places that i've seen on the strip during Covid.
10,Ive booked at the Mandalay Bay and its sister properties 9 times in last 2 months. Six times I was given a room of less value than I paid for without any apologies. Its criminal !! When I inquired about the problem I was told from the front desk staff that they are very aware of the problem with their website that lets guest book and pay for rooms that in reality are not available and that management doesn't address this very serious problem. I know of no business that is allowed to advertise and take money for a service they know they cannot provide over and over again without consequences. I will contact the local news as well as inform people about this on every social and travel media.
50,Everything went well was very nice hotel clean we had the strip view too bad valet wasn’t available but other then that it was a good vacay with my family. And clean hotel and a good price. We will be back
50,Not only gambling but this was the best place I have ever stayed for relaxation. The bed was so comfortable even the pillows. The room service staff was great. The hotel was very clean during Covid. I would love to visit again soon.
30,Was extremely hard to find a restaurant that was not only open but that we could use our credit at. The pool was a joke trying to get into due to the waitlist you had to get on so we never got to enjoy it.
10,We did not have a good experience here and cut our trip short. The hotel requires face masks outside at the pool even if relaxing in the chair yet there was no monitoring of tight spaces inside. For example people were packing into the elevator. I don’t have a problem wearing masks but the rules should make sense.    The pool area was gross dirty face masks and beer cans littered everywhere. There was a grouping literally vaping in the wave pool. Walls were so thin we had to deal with our neighbors blaring music from midnight to 3pm. I will never stay here again.
40,I had a good night sleep. The room was spacious and very clean. There was only one roll of toilet paper but was able to get one from the cleaning lady at the end of the other wing. Casino was nice and had fun.
30,Someone that had just checked in was able to use their key to get into my friends room. That could've gone really badly. Also I paid resort fees and didn't get to utilize any of the amenities. The TV wasn't working during my entire stay
50,Awesome experience at the property from check in to check out. Very courteous & professional staff. The safety measures in place for covid were very reassuring. The attention to detail & even the custom face mask was a nice surprise!
40,I had an exceptional stay here at the Mandalay Bay it was fresh and clean exuberant and lively the pool access and amenities were amazing and the staff was very helpful  And attentive I would certainly stay again for this is my fav hotel in Las Vegas especially during a pandemic beautiful job !!!
10,First time at Mandalay Bay and it be the last. The room we had wasn't cleaned properly our television didn't work and our air conditioner wasn't blowing cold so we were uncomfortable in our room to the point that we had to leave our room to go somewhere else to cool off. Worst hotel experience ever.
30,Casino was very bad experience. Ended up playing at Binions downtown and crushed there. Mandalay Beach was the best part of our stay. STEAKS dinner was comped but below average all around. Would go back if comped again. Most restaurants closed due to Covid but that was expected.
50,Easy check in when we got there with the keyless check-in. The room and casino was very clean! The service to get a drink on the floor was very minimal but if it was due to safety measurements then I understand. Great visit and will stay here again!!!
50,Very Impressed the cleanliness and the overall attitude of the Casino and Hotel Staff. They have taken extra measures during this crisis and we felt very safe and secure .Security and employees politely make sure folks wear masks in the public areas as required. I could not have asked for a better environment under the circumstances.
50,Who doesn’t need a small getaway at this time. Masks mandatory but that’s just fine. I was out and having a good time. I did not want to leave. Can’t Walt to come back. Pool was refreshing. Bed was very comfortable.
10,I recently stayed here and it will be the last time that I do. The staff was not friendly at all. When we checked out they also tried charging me $400 extra dollars to my bill. When asked why they simply argued that was the price and when i showed them my online confirmation for the room price and total I was supposed to have they still argued. There are many other places to stay on the strip I would suggest picking one of them instead of Mandalay Bay. I’ve never had problems at the Luxor or Flamingo when I stayed at those resorts.
50,Love Mandalay Bay. Never fails or disappoints always above average service and the cleanliness and attention to detail at the property is notable. I am already looking for dates to return. Highly satisfying stay!
40,We had a great stay. Noisy neighbors on the first night mad for a difficult time in sleeping. Not what I wanted on the first night on time away from home. It got better the 2 remaining nights. Definitely prefer a non-connecting room
40,Even though a lot of what I come to Las Vegas was closed Mandalay Bay is trying to provide an enjoyable experience. The pool area is still open and fun with great staff. The rooms felt clean and safe.
40,Very clean and wonderful resort.. Has the one of the best pools in Vegas. If your not looking to be in the hustle and bustle of the main part of the strip this is a great place to stay. Didn’t get to try all the restaurants in the hotel due to COVID-19 . The ones we did eat at we good
40,Our stay was very nice and comfortable. The beach area is nice fave masks are required everywhere except inside the pools but I appreciated their dedication to safety. The hotel was easily accessible to Luxor and Excalibur which helped keep my kids occupied with an arcade and HyperX esports. Only reason it received a 4 I because the convenient stores in the hotel were outrageously expensive.
50,Great staff great food great everything! It’s Vegas! Great casino! The rooms were immaculate. The cleanliness was above and beyond. The practice of social distancing and safety is above par. Lovely experience. I highly recommend everyone to visit.
50,The Hotel is super close to the airport my room had a view of the swimming pool and the famous hotel beach and also the airport and mountains. The Hotel has a characteristic smell very rich. You feel the freshness and cleanliness that there is. There are a lot of workers and you can ask anyone for help they are all very nice. At least the room that I touched and from what I could see most of them are like that they have good space and private bathrooms. I hope to visit you again soon!
10,The property was amazing and beautiful the staff was courteous friendly and attentive. Some of the more glaring issues are the inability to utilize the room refrigerator no microwave the cost of items throughout the property. Vacation is supposed to fun and accommodating for the cost of the stay one would think that the property would not try and squeeze every cent from its guest is disheartening. Charging $35.00 a night for the use of a refrigerator is absurd informing guest that removing or storing anything in the room refrigerator is not looking out for perspective return customers. I understand businesses are trying to generate income however trying to charge exorbitant prices for travel size often time forgotten items is disgusting. A liter bottle of water on the minibar shouldn’t cost $16.00. Or the fact that a 20 oz bottle of water a 4oz tube of toothpaste and 8 bottle of mouthwash should not cost $32.06 at the hotel store. I can say I’ve been to Vegas but it’s not a place I ever have to go to again.
40,Bed was dirty upon arrival crumbs under comforter. Bath tub was plugged and full of water and make loud awful noises.The casino and restaurants were great though. But was wasn’t close enough to any of main attractions.
30,"The hotel was okay. Too many people slated to our bank of elevators. Masks given waiting in line and exiting pool....even traveling 15 feet to my mask in my chair. Bill misrepresented. Food and beverage credit difficult to figure out. Many restaurants closed. Shows closed. Trams closed. Uber extremely slow. I am glad I had ""low expectations """
50,My daughter and I loved our stay here- the tram wasn’t running (COVID) so know that it is the furthest resort south on the strip- so it is a far walk ... also know that the fridge can’t be used for anything you may want to keep cold (filled only with things to buy)
40,Very nice hotel. Very nice staff. Appreciate the staff for doing their best at keeping everyone safe during this pandemic. They were all pleasant and helpful making recommendations for restaurants and activities
50,We had a great time for my Cousins wedding. Everything was clean and “COVID“ friendly We felt safe and had a great time. The food was good and so was the drinks. The staff was friendly and I even had a blast playing Craps for the 1st time. We will be back.
30,Security was rude. Check in was easy as it was in the mobile app. The room experience was not great. My first room had not been cleaned yet. Beds unmade. Trash everywhere. There were literally someone’s fake eye lashes on the counter. Called the desk and waited on hold for too long. Then was given a different room 17 floors up and at the end of the hallway. Had to drag all of our stuff to the second room and didn’t receive as much as an apology.
40,We had a really good time but the prices of the food and drink were really too high (almost not worth the trip). I expected high prices but we spent more on food and drink then we did gambling. Might rethink the location for our next weekend escape.
30,I booked a king bed online and when I checked in was informed there were no more rooms available and had to settle for two queens or pay almost $200 for a suite. The receptionist who checked me in did not apologize for the mistake not try to make up for their error. One of the beds had itchy sheets. We stayed during a weekday so not even a lot of people in the hotel unsure why they were not able to accommodate or explain more.
50,Staff is very friendly room are exceptionally cleaned everyday and you really don’t have to leave the hotel  has everything you’re looking for  pools  casino  restaurants and a great spa .... definitely will be going back again .....
20,Blah.. nothing exciting. Appeared to be short staffed. 2020 is not a good year to travel. Food at the house of blues was horrible.. it was the worst brisket I had ever seen.. couldn’t even eat it:( mlife reward was given one night and when we went to use another employee said the previous night they made a mistake and took it away.. it was 25 dollar comp slot play.. I don’t think it would have broken them to let us still have it.. lol
30,Very annoying getting ice at a Motel 6 is easier. Floors locked like your a rat in a cage. It kind of felt like Walmart.  Room nice comfortable bed. Bartenders great. Casino nice. Next time we visit put me next to the ice machine.  Thanks!
40,My wife and I came to the hotel for our honey moon. The room was very clean. The TV in our room did not work well and lost signal about 70% of the time. The staff is very friendly but the cost of items are very high. The hotel is at the end of the strip so going to other casinos and restaurants is quite a hike.
10,I don’t typically leave bad reviews but this was a horrible stay. Room was not clean when we came. Both nights we had different neighbors next door. They were LITERALLY screaming until 7am the first night and then we neighbors did the same until 5am while slamming the walls throwing things at the walls and repeatedly trying to come into our room. The first night we just thought we had bad luck called security but nothing helped. But the second night was absolutely too much. At least 15 people were filtering in and out of the room and the hallways. It was absurd. Both times nothing seemed to be done when I called reception requesting security.  I get that people come to Vegas to have a great time but this was just flat out inconsiderate and I was so disappointed that our room wasn’t even switched and nothing was done to quiet the neighbors down.
30,"Every hotel has adopted a ""lets charge as much as we can"" attitiude. $5 for a water? $15-22 for a mixed drink? $24 for chicken fingers. Not what it used to be. Vegas used to be about the experience no longer like that."
30,Hotel is nice. Staff was rude and not very helpful. We were shocked by the amount of children. It felt like we were at Disney World minus the fantastic customer service. Will not be returning. There are better options for an adult vacation.
40,Everything was great except for having some information that wasn’t correct about dining. Also we weren’t told that you have to bring your own float for the lazy river or buy one from them ($25!). We were pretty upset about that because the lazy river was partly why we chose this specific hotel and no one told us that until we were already at the pool. We didn’t see anything online about it (and I do hours/days of research before traveling anywhere).
50,Very nice accommodations and casino was extremely clean. It was our 1st time there and it was a pleasure. The restaurants were top notch and the food was to die for. We would recommend it to everyone planning a trip to Vegas.
50,Mandalay bay is the best in Vegas. I’d highly recommend it for anyone. It has outstanding service And a great and friendly staff. You can never go wrong at the Mandalay Bay. Take my recommendation and visit there soon if you’re going to Vegas
40,Normally Mandalay Bay has everything you need. Great food options (although I would have preferred at least ONE of their Asian themed venues to have been open during our stay - I understand they needed to cut back on dining due to the low occupancy during Covid but a sushi or noodle option rotated with one of the others would have been nice). I also understand not having daily housekeeper service during Covid however someone should still be cleaning the hotel public areas regularly. The garbage by the elevators was FULL for several days in a row (same garbage not just getting filled each day). The rate came with a Food & Beverage credit daily (which I knew when I booked it but the check in clerk didn’t mention it when we checked in) and upon check out the credits were not accounted for and had to be manually adjusted (makes one wonder if it ever would have been applied if I hadn’t brought it to their attention?). One of the reasons we booked Mandalay Bay was because of the AWESOME Beach & Pool area. Again more Covid adjustments. I just wish they made sense. I can be in the wave pool or lazy river with out a mask but I need to wear a mask while laying on a lounge chair even though the chairs are spread out. Would have rented a Cabana but they were making people wear masks even inside their own 3 walled cabana. Seems excessive. The Aquarium was lovely although a bit smaller than I had expected. A note regarding the in room coffee (I’m talking about the paper coffee cups with Mandalay Bay branded K-cups powdered milk sugar Sweet and Low and cheap little plastic stirrers stuffed inside that you make yourself using the tiny single serve coffee maker - you know the kind you get for free at every Days Inn or roadside motels)... The in room coffee if part of the Mini Bar set up and NOT included with the $39 daily Resort Fee they charge. Don’t worry... 1-800 & Local calls from your room phone ARE covered by your Resort Fee (for the 5 of you out there WITHOUT a cell phone). All in all the service was good the resort is beautiful the food was very good the location is excellent and if you can snag a deal on your stay it was well worth it!!!!
20,Just ok. We stayed 10/13-16 and this cart with trash stayed in the 9th floor near us the entire time. It was there when we checked it. I called the front desk and informed them. They said they would have someone pick it up but when we left it was still there. There were cleaning people on the floor all times of the day and night so to me this was unacceptable.
10,"My stay felt as if I was staying at a low budget hotel. The stay well room I stayed in Vitamin C shower filter was not sealed properly and was leaking between the connection to the shower head. My remote worked periodically I would have to hit the volume button several times just for it to go up or down one. When I complained about the remote some guy came with another remote and handed it to me with no instructions. The new remote was not programed to the TV so it was useless. The guy that came to fix the filter was nice but I hate that the filter was not checked before the room was deemed ready to check in. The hallway was filled with water at one point and I was told a piped burst. Then the elevators were slow and/or not working from Friday to Sunday. At one point only 1 was working out of the four we were allowed to use. There were 2 elevators being blocked by a bouncer looking man. He said those 2 were for special guests and only 1 out of the four we were allowed to use working and that security was coming to take a small group at a time to the staff elevator. The nerve of the hotel! If all 4 elevators were working and it was just crowded I would understand the VIP elevators but the issue with the elevators was the hotels fault.It made no sense to have the elevator area crowded during a pandemic because they wanted to keep 2 elevators as V.I.P despite the fact 3 were out of order! We waited over 5 minutes. Then when secuirty came we had to walk from the main elevator across the lobby to the staff elevator. I was taken up to my floor the 59th floor but the staff elevator was next to room 235. So I then had to walk from room 235 to 130 (the full length of 2 hallways) I spent most days waiting over 5 minutes for an elevator to arrive. Then another slow ride to the 59th floor slow even when no one was getting on or off. When I complained again during check out I explained I stayed in the Aria in January and that hotel was amazing and this hotel is by far the worst as the ""stay well"" room was overshadowed by all the inconveniences. The staff said well this hotel could never compare to any of the other MGM and continued to ramble in agreement and that this hotel was indeed out of date. To hear the staff talk poorly about his own hotel confirmed they are aware of the issues. There was no attempt to improve my stay or compensate for the inconvenience either! Never again will they see me or the large group I came with!"
40,Hotel was great considering the Covid restrictions. Paid for a strip view room but got one that overlooked the pool. Went through mobile check in so no one to talk to about it so I just kept it. Slots are my money!
50,If you want to feel like royalty then stay at mandalay bay. This hotel checks all the boxes on your list. The accommodations alone had my interest but the hospitality made my stay. I was so impressed by the beach food and entertainment. If you want to feel special and be treated like royalty then reserve your room.    Thank you!!!
40,A quick stay at the Mandalay Bay from post work trip to Cali before returning home. The hotel rates are great given the location. I paid the exact same daily rate in California for a Hampton Inn hotel which lacked the casino and all of the amenities.
40,The stay was good in the Horizon suite. Excellent view and room was clean. Also the casino is great and the choice of restaurants is good. The only problem was waiting in line several times to get an elevator up to the 59th floor. Not good.
40,Stay: 10/11-10/13    My wife and I wanted to get away with the baby so we decided on Mandalay Bay due to a few reasons including 1) pool complex 2) suite price 3) availability of crib    Our car was packed with baby stuff so before checking in we pulled up to the front entrance and used the bellhop service. They give you a ticket and hold your bags for you and once you check in and arrive to your room you call them and they bring it up. Bellhop service also available when checking out.    Overall we had a great stay and enjoyed our mini vacation.    Pros:  Clean spacious suite. We stayed in the Penthouse Skyview Suite on the 60th floor. 2 flat screen TV’s – one in living room the other in the bedroom.  Small sink located behind counter which came in handy as we washed the baby’s bottles there. Small mini fridge provided in addition to their stocked fridge.  They provided 2 masks and hand sanitizer. The masks were great quality and re-usable.  Only gripe would be the pillows on the bed were large and uncomfortable. Mattress itself was soft and great though.    Friendly service – the bellhop housekeeping service front desk staff were all kind and ready to help.    Pool – their complex is massive and was the highlight of our trip. We reserved 2 chairs with an umbrella and were placed right in front of the wave pool.  The wave pool has a 48” minimum height requirement but they have a shallow area off to the side where babies can play.  They also have a fun lazy river where you can bring your own tubes or you can rent one for $.  Staff walks around and provides disposable masks for anyone walking around or sitting down and not eating/drinking. Masks are not required when in the water.    The hotel providing a crib (Pack n play) was one of the main reasons why we stayed here. When contacting other properties such as Caesars they would not provide one due to covid restrictions.    Cons:  Check in was a hassle as there was a long line and people were not practicing social distancing.  They have a mobile check-in app and I recommend you utilize that to save time.  We checked in at the counter because we wanted to make sure we received the baby crib (pack n’ play) for our little one.    No social distancing in elevators  They do not enforce capacity limits in any of their elevators.  In the parking garage there are only 2 elevators so be prepared to either wait or cram into them especially if you come on a weekend when it’s busier.    Food options limited. This is due to covid so not the property’s fault but the options were mediocre at best.  We got breakfast at Citizen’s and the food was not that good or worth the money paid.  We got dinner at Burger Bar and the quality of the burgers was underwhelming.  We did have a good experience with breakfast at House of Blues. I recommend going there for a meal.  If you have time go to a restaurant off the strip – plenty of great options for anything you’re in the mood for.    Housekeeping services were lagging most likely due to covid. After we checked in and arrived to our room we called housekeeping to request for the crib and extra towels and it took 1.5 hours to arrive.
50,Excellent experience from the time I arrived till the time I departed the service and amenities were top notch. The gaming tables were clean and the restaurants were absolutely phenomenal. This will be our go baby o resort every time we go to Vegas!
30,The hotel is beautiful with lots of restaurants .  The customer service was subpar . It took an hr to check in . They were peddling online check in  this did not seem to work for the majority  we were then asked to make another line for online help . They could not help and asked we go back to another long line ...fail  Way too many children walking around the casino  so odd.  Drinks were overpriced.
50,🟦I’ve stayed at NYNY Mirage Luxor and MGM (my former favorite). Before that I was a loyal Caesars guest.  This trip I finally stayed at Mandalay Bay.  WOW! Seriously I mean “WOW”!    Check in was fast. The young lady who assisted me was professional friendly and helpful.    As for my room...It was a one bedroom penthouse sky view suite. WOW again!  ✅Wet bar with fridge.  ✅Half bath (yes a total of one and a half bathrooms).  ✅Well laid out nicely furnished living quarters.  ✅Spacious (again) nicely furnished bedroom.  ✅Huge master bathroom with his and her sinks walk in shower and (my favorite) a spa tub with jets. Seats two comfortably.    There’s a total of four TV (one in wet bar one in living quarters one in bedroom and one in mirror in bathroom).    There’s floor to ceiling windows in the living quarters and bedroom. Since I was on the 61st floor I had a magnificent view of the new Las Vegas Raiders Stadium! I mean a direct/right across the street view!...I ❤️ this view!  I’d prefer this suite each time I return to Las Vegas.    The casino was lively. All of the guests were orderly and respectful.  The slots that I played were generous with me. No complaints.  The Mandalay Bay security was amazing! They were always visible. They gave me a sense of safety. I always felt safe and comfortable on their property. A special shout out to the Mandalay Bay security team! THANK YOU!    Let’s talk about housekeeping...The ladies who serviced my room (again 61st floor) were super! Very friendly very professional very helpful! I applaud those ladies! THANK YOU!    Oh I have to mention the MB Market. Those ladies were top shelf! THANK YOU!    THANK the men and women who are keeping Mandalay Bay opened!    This was a fantastic trip during a tragic year. I needed this trip. The Mandalay Bay employees more than exceeded my expectations.    I’ll be staying at Mandalay Bay exclusively from this trip forward! You have won me over!    THANK YOU ALL!    Blue  ❤️
50,All of the staff were friendly and helpful. We had a phenomenal day in the cabana we rented which was very worth it. The room was exceptionally clean and comfortable. We will absolutely be visiting again when we can.
40,We had a great stay! Everything was wonderful except for the fact that the ice machine wasn't in service and they charge to use the fridge. Fridge should be included in the price of the room...especially with paying a daily resort fee. It wasn't crowded which was nice. They were adamant about masks but not overly up your butt to where it ruined the experience. I will definitely be back.
50,This is the best hotel I have stayed in the best views rooms and service. My complete stay here was enjoyable and pleasurable. This is my hotel I want to book every time I come to Las Vegas. It's a pet friendly hotel as well that's important.
50,We didn’t leave the resort! A great place to enjoy a get away. The rooms were really clean and staff very friendly. Food restaurants choices were excellent. Check out was very easy. Thank you    We will be back
50,This is a comprehensive resort with awesome pools. We got a cabana because seating at the pools can be limited. It was a luxurious experience with excellent service. You will need to wear masks everywhere including at the pools. There are many restaurants but they are pricy. The rooms have a tub and a shower
20,The room had a clogged sink when we arrived which was really gross and the lights in the bathroom and main room did not work. It was supposed to be a nice suite but I would not pay full price for this room.
20,Only one elevator working causing very long wait times and people shoulder to shoulder. Someone linked to our rooms Bluetooth speaker and started blaring music and there was no button to turn it off. Our rooms fridge stayed warm the whole time.
10,Upon arrival I knew I was going to regret booking this hotel. They had signs everywhere saying masks were mandatory but were not enforcing them. As you went to registration the lady pretending to take your temperature. She couldn’t even tell me my reading. Because it was all a facade.    The guy who checked us in was super rude. First he couldn’t find our reservation then was annoyed because he was looking for my Boyfriends name that was on his license and not the name on the reservation (Gerardo Gerry). After we corrected us he lectured us about using correct names and proceeded to tell us that they were out of king beds (that’s what we reserved) and he had to put us in a double bed... I asked if we got a discount and he said they should be charging us more for a double room so yes we are... um we didn’t even want a double. So no we weren’t. There was no order for elevator use it was a free for all with people packing in them. There are was trash in the hallways and throughout the casino. Why are they not raising their cleaning standards?  I like that they give you a little welcome covid bag. However the pipes in the room were gurgling all night in the sink. I thought they were going to explode. The walls are also paper thin and we had the pleasure of being next to a screaming baby all night. Between the screaming baby and the gurgling pipes I definitely regret not drinking myself into a sleep coma to at least get some rest.  This place advertises itself as somewhere that’s nice. But don’t be fooled. It’s not.
50,Visited during the pandemic. Washing station at the casino floor free mask and hand sanitizer at multiple locations so we felt safe and healthy. The contactless check in and check out via the MGM app is a major plus. Hunts if you wish to visit the shark reef maker sure to make reservation ahead of time.
50,The Mandalay Bay is an amazing hotel and casino! With outstanding customer service willing to help and accommodate you while staying there. The rooms are big comfortable bed and lovely tub to soak in!
10,My wife and I attended a wedding on Oct 9-11 and stayed at Mandalay Bay. Room was nice. However rates you see do not include the following charges which are in the fine print or not posted.  Resort fee - $39 per day  Resort tax - $ 9.36 per day  Water in your room for drinking. $16 per bottle  Coffee/Tea $5 per cup used    We reserved and confirmed a king bed but upon arrival we were assigned a double bed room. The check-in attendants offered us an $85 food and beverage credit we said no the credit got to $100 with the promise to book us in a king room the following day. Never was contacted about the King room available so spent an hour at the check-in trying to change our room to no avail. The $100 food and beverage credit only applies to 6 restaurants and bars that were open at the resort. After a $22 gin and tonic and a $25 Black Russian Half the credit was gone. None of the credit can be used for water or bar items in your room. Thanks for the heads up hotel customer service. Alcohol is the most expensive on site so BYOB to save a couple hundred. Stop at the ABC store on the way from the airport. It’s worth the trip.    Nicer hotels (Not MGM owned) are better and lower cost by the end of the trip. Look at the Cosmopolitan as an alternative. Hope this helps.
30,Had to switch room ac was not working 2nd room had a toilet room that smelled like cigarettes kids had to use the toilet with the door open we were too tired to pack and switch rooms again. Also had the worst wifi of any hotels
50,Great nice big rooms and a very nice friendly staff. No refrigerator for personal food or drinks which sucks if you don't have a ice chest. Room service has a minimum of $100.00 to order which is not worth it for a quick recovery bite.
10,When you make a booking read all their webside small prints. You will pay a deposit for 100$ per night which is not mention on any part of the prices when you book your room! Dont touch any of their water bottles they have sensors and charge you 16$ per a water. Not recommended if you have small kids at all
30,I shouldn't be able to see my footprints or have write Hi in the dust settled on the tile floor.    Both us and our friends in the joining room were grossed out.    Shoes on for the rest of my stay.  Not comfortable.    The lady at checkout didnt offer a discount resolution or an apology. Just told me she would put a note in the system.    My friends said it's a pretty casino but they will find other accommodations next time we go to vegas at the end of October.
50,Covid precautions were greatly executed staff was awesome and friendly hotel was very clean restaurants and shops were a plus overall were already planning a trip to come back with the kids before the end of the year.
50,We checked in early and from beginning to end everything was great...also went to the hotel's Shark Reef. I would recommend anyone to stay here especially with the weekly rates being so low. The only thing if I had a complaint would be the hotel is at the end of the strip.
50,Could not have been better. The place is excellent and was exceptionally clean organized and I felt totally safe. Have not been there for some time but I strongly recommend it I also love the location. By the way the new mall next door had some of the beat quality and pricing I have ever seen !!!
10,Not having any restaurants open at 10 pm is crap. Closing have the bathrooms crap. Closing a pool is crap. Stay closed if you don't want to people there and definitely make it clear how little the resort open on your website.
30,Expected more attention to detail. The room service was service in boxes and we did not have any table for the two us to eat. We had to eat of our laps. The double bed is too small for two adults. I had reserved a King room but was only give a double. We did not have adequate amount of silver ware.
20,Casino is a service industry. You don't know the basic attitude that a service industry should have.  Losing money at a casino is common (I don’t care about that !) . I hate it when employees are unfriendly
40,Very pretty casino with nice rooms. Rooms are big w a nice big bathroom. Easy walk through the shops to Luxor. It is located at the end of the strip - pretty quiet down there. The property itself is really nice.    I wouldn’t stay there again if the tram wasn’t running. Usually the tram goes up to Luxor and Excalibur and then you can take another tram to aria and bellagio.    The pool looks beautiful but for a four diamond property it was lacking. No umbrellas or side tables unless you pay to rent one. They charge $25 for a tube to go in the lazy river. The fees for chair and cabana rentals are really steep too. No one comes by with pitchers of water and no water stations by the pool. The wave pool was freezing and you can’t stand in any of the shallow water at all. Hot tubs were all closed (bc of Covid?) and face masks even if you’re sitting in your chair which seems very excessive. You’re outside for one thing plus sitting down like you would in a restaurant. No face masks are required while sitting in a restaurant so that didn’t make sense to me. We were looking forward to a nice long day at the pool. We didn’t stay long at the pool bc of all that.
40,Things are different in Vegas right now due to COVID. It's hard to leave a review because the experience was so different that previous trips. The facility was running on a much smaller staff as was evident in fewer staff on the gaming floor and limited dining. The room was clean and beds amazingly comfortable. I felt safe in the property and we very much enjoyed the pool area.
40,Went with friends very nice rooms. The wave pool and beach atmosphere was just what we wanted! I brought my own pool inner tubes and was able to inflate them near the lazy river area. The beds are extremely comfortable best sleep ever!
50,Absolutely gorgeous! Everything was perfect beds were so comfortable staff was extremely friendly and helpful casino coffee shops restaurants entertainment literally everything you need right on site definitely will be returning!!!
50,We stayed for 3 nights and we chose Mandalay Bay for the swimming pools.  The swimming pool was amazing and our son loved the lazy river.  There is also wave pool for so much fun.  Besides there is Aquarium where my 4-year-old son loved.  The room was also great. Very nice and clean.  The front desk staff were very nice and knowledgable.  The location is the edge of the strip and I can't deny that i felt it's a little bit isolated from other casinos on the strip especially the monorail was closed due to covid-19.  However we could use taxi without any problem to go to other casino and restaurants.  We will definitely go back to Mandalay Bay for next vacation.
10,Staff at MB was very unfriendly. The strip is totally unsafe after dark. No police presence. None. Thugs smoking weed and harassing people on every corner and every footbridge. Even formerly nice areas.
50,Hotel was clean the bed was awesome and the food at their restaurants was good! Every staff member I encountered was super nice and friendly and went above what was asked if them. My suite was big and I loved the view to the strip
50,highly recommend this hotel checking in and out was the easiest 👌 the hotel itself is very beautiful and elegant now the pools are on another level of nice my kids loved there stay at the mandalay bay
50,From check in to check out everything was awesome. Thanks Mandalay Bay & Mlife for making our stay wonderful. Like to come back next month for Thanksgiving week! Pool was awesome we felt safe not to crowded.
50,What's not to like? I know it took a black eye but it seems staff have doubled down and worked extra hard to make it welcoming. In addition the House of Blues is on of my favorite locations Prices are fair rooms are spacious and VERY clean.
30,"We waited over an hour to get our code that never came to be told that they didn't have our room. We waited another 30 minutes for them to figure out what to do they finally put us in a 2 bed room. This was a celebration for our anniversary. They promised to get us switched over to the room type we reserved first thing the next morning. We were supposed to get a text. We never heard so we spent the day at the hotel waiting. I ended up calling them at 3:30pm or so and they finally got us switched over. During this process we were told by 2 employees that the manager would ""take care"" of us and they noted a room upgrade and food and drink credit to our account for the hassle and waisted time and because it was our anniversary. We did not get a upgrade but we did get $100 in credit. I wouldn't be upset except that we were told one thing and it was not followed through on."
50,We had not been to Las Vegas in 14 years! We were not disappointed by our return. The food was awesome the pool staff was great . Bernice at the pool was awesome. There was a small problem with our bill and it was corrected right away with several comps thrown in !
40,They have a great pool area with a wave pool and lazy river that was fun. I like the openness of the casino as well; it didn’t feel crammed. I do however have one quibble with the room: the door to the bathroom has daylight between the mountings so taking a shower isn’t exactly a private thing. Other than that I enjoyed my stay.
50,I enjoyed my stay at the Mandalay Bay Resort. It was amazing and I loved everything about it. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice and not too pricey resort to stay at in Vegas. I’d advise anyone looking to reserve cabanas to book prior to arriving as they will fill up fast!
50,"You wont be disappointed. Even with the covid bs going on still had the ""Vegas Experience""! I understand they're just starting to open back up & so the cautionary rules a bit much but i get it..not their fault. Eat at the Stripsteak and try the rib cap...you wont be disappointed. Blackjack tables are restricted to 3 to a table so they seemed a little quieter than norm...but the cards were on my side so that made up for the ""mask up when drinks down"" rule! Only problem that some may have in my opinion is that its at the end of the strip making it really far from a lot of places. I'll be back for sure though!"
10,We went for 5 nights to get away for a bit with the kids. The pillows smelled like womens perfume I called to ask them to change the sheets and pillows yet it was not done. We found human feces in the bathroom and I will tell you they do NOT clean thoroughly! I asked the front desk to send someone and they supposedly did yet the smudge of the feces that I had to clean remained there the entirety of our stay. so gross!!
10,I reserved a 2 bed Staywell suite with $50 credits towards food. The description states that is the cleanest room you could find during Covid Pandemic only for me to arrive late that evening and go to bed wake up to take a shower and its dried blood in the shower  bathroom floor was dirty as well as the tub  even in the small toilet area (with no ventilation) appeared to be dirty as well. I immediately called the front desk who then sent up the head of housekeeping that took pictures told us we had to leave so they can clean provided us with a $75 beverage voucher that she said we can use at Fat Tuesday inside of the Resort only for us to leave 4 hours  find out Fat Tuesday doesnt accept the voucher and that the beds and trash were changed but the bathroom was the EXACT SAME. i called down stairs again only for them to send someone up immediately to clean it and told my they credited my room with yet another $75 on room service & have $113 for resort fees refunded. I asked for a different room or even some of my money back and they told me they couldnt do it which was crazy because i reserved a top tier clean room only to get the opposite. To add insult to injury  the next morning i woke up at 7 am and put the signs on the door asking no one to enter  my wife  daughter & service animal were also in bed still so i didnt want them to come back in especially when it took them to 7pm the previous night to clean it before. I also called downstairs and asked for my room to be extended for check out til the following day.... 10 am comes and my wifes calls me in a panic saying someone opened our room door 3 times and on the third entry she screamed NO and they closed the door. Furious  i called down stairs and they said they was sending security up for a report only for him to ask me 3 questions & say he was going down stairs to get the door pad history to see who tried to enter they never followed up  they didnt care about the comfortability or even the fact they kept saying they were coming to clean  only to not clean what was requested and then someone is trying to come in our room 3 times with both signs on the door saying dont come in !!!!! To make matters even worse my check out bill was overcharged $270.12 (i have proof) only for me to go through each charge and i didnt owe them a dime. Overall my peace of mind is out of wack  that was false advertisement and a violation of privacy so i intend to seek legal consult
40,Mostly everything was great. Experienced a bit of a drink problem at the bikini bar near the pool but the staff was kind and understanding. Water is way too expensive. There was also a bar fight down by the casino and I wasn’t too impressed with the time it took for security to get to the situation when the attackers were long gone by the time the security got there.
30,"Smell of marijuana at pool hallways in room. TV did not work in room so had to be moved after we unpacked. Trash and half full coffee cups left in room after it was ""COVID sterilized"". No sticker on the door saying the room was clean."
20,When we arrived we had to pay a deposit in spite of reserving and paying for the room with a major credit card. The deposit was not disclosed upon booking and was sent to us in an email shorty before check in. The hotel room did not have a usable refrigerator it had a minibar and if anything was placed in the mini bar other than what was stocked it was a 50$ per day charge. The room did not have a coffee maker except for a coffee maker that charges you 10$ per cup of coffee the was no microwave in the room. The hotel amenities were atrocious. Every amenity of the hotel was only available at an exorbitant cost. The hotel is at the very end of the strip and not close to any of the other hotels or stores. It is not within walking distance of any entertainment. Parking is confusing and not discussed upon check in. The staff with the exception of one concierges employee were rude and had little interest in assisting us. The pools on the property were not impressive to us at all. The way pool took up the majority of space. We were on our honeymoon and wanted to relax poolside and there was simply no where on the pool deck that that was possible. I recommend booking anywhere else in Vegas.
50,Always exceptional service. My room wasn't ready on time so they gave me a free upgrade and got me in a room right away! No problem they don't solve immediately to ensure you enjoy your stay. I highly reccomend this casino/hotel.
20,Could not deliver 3 King rooms which I had booked and paid deposit on months in advance. Also rooms were sooo hot. Temperature in rooms never got below 71 degrees in 5 days even with curtains closed during day and night.
40,Pool workers with blue shirts aggressive when came to customer service they trying to sell every chair in side of pools they came to us stating chair were reserved and if we wanted they demanded $400.00 Not in nicely way
20,Room cleaning is poorly cleaned  Second day they forgot also to clean our room  then we had in the middle of the night an electric burn smell at like 1:30 am took them till 2:30 am to fix that and the burning smell so we didn’t get any sleep. We were on the 28 floor on Friday last night apparently there is a club couple of floors above us was loud music till 3:30 am we couldn’t rest at all. Casino everyone just losing money all over I wouldn’t gamble there! Staff wasn’t really friendly either. Plus the hotel is very far located on the beginning of the strip so u can’t just walk out and go anywhere The only thing that’s nice there is the beach pool that is it
50,We were there with 40 + friends and family for the wedding. The staff from check-in to departure were great. Very clean room and many obvious precautions during the pandemic. The wedding was held very privately away from all other guests. Very attractive resort.
50,We stayed at the Mandalay Bay before school started for my family to use the pools. Although the pools were fairly busy I was extremely impressed to see high level of health safety precautions taken through the casino restaurants and pool areas.  Two of us had food poisoning from a local restaurant (The Bootlegger Bistro) and stayed in the room. The staff was considerate and supplied us with clear liquids through rooms service. The Mlife rewards program and MGM app was helpful navigating through the entire vacation.  The staff including housekeeping were discreet safe and attentive.  Overall with all things COVID I felt safe and would make a return visit to Mandalay Bay.
50,First time staying at this hotel. We had a beautiful suite with plenty of room. Room was very clean. We were on the 4th floor so the view outside was not that great. We will stay again in the future but will ask for a room up higher.
50,We were pleased to see how Mandalay Bay is handling the pandemic. We felt safe yet not overwhelmed in the casino or restaurants. The pool was a bit overbroad. We had to wear a mask when we were in the cabana which seemed overboard.
20,Staff was very rude very expensive and blind sided by a $400 deposit on a $265 stay. That is absolute insanity! This used to be my favorite hotel but probably looking for other options after being gouged like we were. Due to Covid most things were closed so what’s the point of a pricy hotel? Hotel room was nice and areas were clean.
30,Initially asked for connecting rooms ... got to our rooms and one of the rooms was Dirty (still in use) 2nd rooms were not connecting 3rd rm the key didn’t work to the other room. No one could accommodate my request. They only comp one night. Should’ve comp my whole 2 day stay. Will NEVER go back to Mandalay Bay. I’m sooo hurt and disappointed I really liked the “Beach”
30,We went to Mandalay Bay for short weekend get away. The hotel is beautiful. But the entire time there we had issues with our tv. The tv would loss signal and go out while watching the Raiders first home game in Las Vegas. So that made me upset. But they final moved us to a suite with better tv on the last night we was there. My biggest issues was I missed the Raiders game.
10,Mask every where. Certain groups of people would have the mask rules enforced other people no enforcement. Grounds dirty the pool area was dirty and we were the first people to the pool. Some pools closed and other pools not allowed to go to because they were Delano guest so hard to keep 6 feet but a must to wear the mask at the pool but let's cram everyone into less pools
40,We stayed at the Mandalay Bay Beach Resort because of the pools. While we were there we rented two cabanas. The saddest part of our experience is that the employees are more concerned with people wearing masks than having fun. This will become a problem. I hope they can fix this. The property is beautiful.
50,Had an excellent time at the Mandalay Bay. The rooms are incredible especially the Stay Well Suites. The pools are top notch and this will be my choice every time. Covid-19 guidelines were followed without fail. There's no reason to stay at the more expensive resorts when this is the amazing escape.
20,We just stayed at the Mandalay Bay Resort for my 50th birthday and it was a lackluster experience.    The rooms were clean and nice though not much better than some hotel chains we stay at -- but it was good enough. The pool area is fantastic but you have to wear a mask while sitting in the heat. All of restaurants and bars are overpriced with a beer from the store by the pool costing $16 each!!! No free coffee in the room and you must pay $10 for a pod (one cup).    The location is on the nicer side of the strip and the property is well maintained. The staff seemed cold and lifeless when I interacted with them. The casino is nice and clean if you like to gamble or people watch.    It just felt like everything was about getting as much money from the customer as possible with no nice upgrades for spending my birthday there.    Mandalay Bay Resort wasn't horrible but it certainly wasn't the experience I hoped for. The best part was being with my family and walking the strip.    I recommend saving your money by booking My Place Hotel or another property then go to the strip for your fun especially since parking is free.
50,From the time to arrival & due to the pandemic times it's very easy the access to check in & void lines & congregations great communications via email & when you arrive it's time to enjoy the pools and great casino that they've restaurants options in general prepare yourselves for a great & friendly experience 👍🤗👍
10,Had a 3 night comped stay. Decided for 2 nights. When i called to see if i can extend i was told no and they tried to overcharge me. I left. Front agents were rude. Chair in room was broken flipped over and hit the glass and injured my toe. I advised agent they did nothing.
50,I came for a class... from NYC... experience was great was a solo trip.. so many option to pools restaurants gift shop and very family friendly.. I will defiantly be coming back to Mandalaybay in Vegas
10,Room was filthy unkempt and not worth the money. a lot of problems with rotting food left behind and obvious no detail to keeping it clean in today's world! Called down to correct the problems and got someone on the phone that was not worried about the customers concerns.
10,Was there for my 25th anniversary and the lack of service and the mask harassment was terrible. I didn't get the room I paid for and my wife got hassled for standing by me while I played blackjack. If you like fun or vegas don't even think of staying here till they get rid of their covid restrictions. Bars closed had to make an appointment to go to the pool it was the worst. Stay home you will have more fun . Help them kill the golden goose if they are this stupid.
50,I have not been to Vegas in almost 20 years. To finally make it back and see the new Las Vegas and what it had to offer our stay during this crazy time with Covid was better than expected at Mandalay Bay. This resort makes you feel safe to be out and about in public. When we arrived to check in there was a staff member that checks your temperature. They have hand sanitizer at the front desk while your checking in. They also offer mobile checkin. When you get to your room there is a nice goodie bag with two masks hand sanitizer and a tool to help push buttons so your not touching anything. When walking around they offer masks and hand sanitizer on the casino floor. You visibly see staff cleaning machines and floors throughout the day. This eased our anxiety tremendously.
10,We arrived an hour before the pool was going to close and were disappointed to find that there were used masks and trash all over the “beach”. It was disgusting! Used masks on the ground probably end up spreading covid rather than preventing it! Also our shower in our hotel room didn’t have hot water. I called guest services who told me they would send an engineer up to the room but couldn’t tell me when they would get there. We were in a hurry to get to a dinner reservation so that was unacceptable. Then they offered to get us another room in a totally separate wing of the hotel which obviously meant repacking and moving everything and hoping the next room we got would have hot water. In the end there was no resolution only attitude from guest services and my husband and I both took cold showers. I will never return to Mandalay Bay would have rather stayed in our travel trailer!!
50,Best hotel and atmosphere I've stayed at in Vegas if you want luxury sure their are other hotels but Mandalay bay is pure luxury in touch with reality the pool alone is relaxing during this time staff is amazing and attentive.
10,Mold!!!! Used masks littered everywhere. Long wait at check in. Majority of shops and restaurants closed. No music at the pool. Long waitlist to get into the pool and if you need to go up to your room you have to rejoin the waitlist before you can re-enter. Rude staff. Bed sagging. Weak $30 drinks at the pool. The list goes on and on. Used to be classy. Will stay at Caesar’s next time.
10,I had my wedding at the Mandalay Bay and if it could go wrong it did. My wedding coordinator lacked communication skills. When I was suppose to check into my wedding suite I found out it was CANCELLED.
50,As a couple we love to walk so we explored the main strip area and found Mandalay Bay by far the cleanest casino in  the area . Best kept secret   The staff in the casino as well outside the pool area kept people safe and protected .  We felt safe and relaxed
40,We recently spent 4 days at the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegs. Honestly not the greatest time to travel  but needed to find a sense a normalcy in these strange times. The Hotel and Casino were spotless. The staff was extremely friendly and kind. I found the online hotel check-in to be slightly disorganized or confusing. It was Labor day weekend and everyone was trying to keep a social distance check in virtually and follow the COVID rules etc. It was forgivable given the Hotel's efforts to keep everyone safe. The pool was fully open masked required. I overheard some complaining about the mask rules in the pool area but for us it was ok. The pool was less crowded and that was a bonus. This was a 5 star stay with one exception food choices.  Many restaurants are still closed (understandably). Don't let COVID keep you away the property was prepared and safe. Plan on returning very soon...
50,"Nice size rooms with comfortable beds and pillows. Very clean with pleasant odor. Awesome sand beach with wave pool and lazy river. Reduced room rates and free parking. Free towels and lounger chairs with drink service. Outstanding restaurants and bars. RiRa is an outstanding Irish Pub with good food (breakfast lunch & dinner) and live music on select nights. Interesting bars like the ""Ice Bar"" and Prohibition ""Bar"". Enticing slot machines with good payouts. Will definitely stay here again."
50,I really enjoyed the stay. Front desk lady was a sweetheart pool was fun rooms were nice. Had a little issue with the room charge but it got handled. I am pretty picky when it comes to hotels but this one was up to standards for sure. I recommend this place.
50,I was pleasantly happy with the level of detail of safety during a pandemic. Given these uncertain times me and my travel companions felt safe welcomed and taken care of by everyone. Thank you to MB
50,This was mine and my Husbands first time staying in Las Vegas! We went for our 25th wedding Anniversary and our stay at the Mandalay was exceptional! The hotel was very clean the staff was very helpful and friendly! We had a wonderful time!
40,Overall great experience. Room over all was clean but shower had mold. Staff were very friendly from front desk to HSK. Felt safe with the mask stations and face enforcement. Enjoyed the pool and over all had a great mini family vacation
20,For such a nice property why they feel they have to charge you $10 for the water $15 to use the in-room coffee and $50 to put anything in the provided mini-bar fridge was petty and sad. Soon they will charge for soap to wash your hands.  Room was crazy noisy. DO NOT get a room with an adjoining door if you don't want to hear every word said in the next room. Bring earplugs as you will also hear every person walking and talking in the hallways from many rooms away. At least that was our experience on the 7th floor. Great view of the new Raider Stadium though.....
40,The staywell rooms are very relaxing the beds are amazing. We recommend it highly. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The entire hotel staff kept everyone safe and are on top of the social distancing.
50,We love our penthouse suite so comfortable with fantastic views of the pools and very quiet. You don’t heard a sound from the planes or nothing.  The hotel is very secure and there is people around everywhere taking care of you and making people to keep social distance and wearing masks.  My only complaint is the quality of drinks at the casino. I couldn’t get my favorite brands it doesn’t matter I told the waitress I was Platinum.
30,We had a private 2 room suite. It was dirty. Toilets leaked everywhere and the AC didn’t work in one of the bedrooms and started smoking. Complained multiple times and it was never fixed during our stay.
50,Excellent hotel for the price you won't see it all in 2 days. The pool is incredible it has a lazy river and the aquarium was mesmerizing my wife and I will definitely return as soon as we have the chance.
50,My husband grandson and I stayed here on a whim when we saw the water park. We had a fabulous time! After staying the night I learned that my dad was hospitalized in Las Vegas Mandalay Bay worked with us and gave us a great deal the next 2 nights while my dad was hospitalized! Great customer service! I would recommend this resort! Room was fabulous and clean!
20,The first room I was given was dirty even though there was tape on the door indicating it was cleaned. Pieces of paper on the floor dirt in the corners of the bathroom and A LOT of lime and mildew on the shower head. This room was on the 27th floor. I called the front desk to ask for another room. This time I was moved down to the 8th floor. This room had no sunlight coming in from the windows so it was depressing. The shower head didn't have mildew but there was still dust and dirt along the bases of the furniture. The bottom of the box spring had hair and dirt. There was no point in asking for ANOTHER room. The hallways smelled like smoke and the carpets were filthy.  However the Casino itself was very nice and clean the front desk staff and baggage helpers were wonderful.  Mandalay Bay needs to invest in keeping their rooms clean or else their rates should be at Luxor level.
20,I have never once felt unsafe inside a hotel in Las Vegas and have stayed at the Delano (attached to this same casino multiple times). The clientele of Mandalay Bay has changed drastically with the lower prices offered as a result of COVID-19. I was asked for money on the casino floor and felt threatened more than once by groups of young men throughout my 3 night Labor Day weekend stay. Two men were roaming my floor (26th) after 12am and seemingly waiting for victims as they clearly did not have a key. I blocked my door with a chair on my last night.    While there was plenty of security checking for masks throughout the hotel (and pool) they were not watching in terms of the security and safety of the guests. I did not feel safe staying here with my friends for a ladies weekend. Be warned that the price of the rooms may have a direct impact on your personal security. I would not stay at Mandalay Bay again.    Additionally our supposedly just cleaned room was not clean. There was visible dust throughout the room the toilet area corners were filthy and there was mold/lime stains throughout the shower.
40,"*Disclaimer* I did not stay herebut visited a friend who was a guest. The facilities - Top Notch! Pool areas - Unbelievable! Amount & Selection of Shops- Great! I personally like the location;at the very end of the southern Strip near desert. The gaming though;definitely not ""loose"". If I we're going to stay @ a Strip hotel....based on previous stays @ other facilities....this one would be near the top of the list;excluding the really high-end properties like the Palazzo & Venetian. A person could could spend their entire stay in Vegas here with a wave poollazy riverplenty of gaming opportunitiesa Theathera mall type shopping expierencegood foodconvention center with banquet facilities....just walking around the property is an adventure! Any interaction I had with the staff was polite & helpful. I know where I'll be booking my next stay in Vegas!"
20,Stayed here many times before always had a good experience. Staff at the front desk concierge and pool were great. We rented a day bed for the day($400) it was wicker and breaking up. When we sat on it it was so saggy I had to put several towels under the mattress to make it some what comfy. Underneath was full of chips and trash obviously had not been cleaned. They are concerned about masks the whole time they forgot to clean the hotel. When we got to the room there was a piece of paper taped on the door indicating it was cleaned. But the corners were full of dust spiderwebs on the safe obviously that room hadn’t been rented in some time and had not been cleaned properly. On our last night there I was a awakened at 3:30 in the morning by a vacuum yes a vacuum!Housekeeping was in the room next-door cleaning. About 30 minutes later somebody must’ve checked into that room and I could literally hear thier whole conversation through the walls. When I reached out to customer front desk they asked what what she expected her to do about it? They asked if I wanted Security to come up but it wasn’t their fault that I could hear a normal voice conversation coming through the conjoining door room. The front desk person then explained that that’s how those rooms were because it was a conjoining room and I told them I had stayed many many times in hotels where they have a conjoining room door and I have never been able to hear my neighbors conversations. I think next time we will stay at a different resort It’s disappointing to pay so much money to sit in dirty chairs dusty rooms and have poor customer service.
50,We had a fabulous trip! Not sure why there were all the negative reviews. We felt very safe! They are definitely taking Covid seriously. Yes you have to wear a mask at the pool but that’s not their fault those are the rules they have to follow. We went down the other end of the strip and it was way too many people down there and no social distancing at all...so I feel Mandalay Bay is doing it right. Beautiful pool no problems at all getting a chair. Our room was clean and quiet! Overall a great stay and we will definitely be going back next summer!
10,First off I planned this quick trip with my husband to getaway for my 40th birthday! When we arrived around 9:30 at night we went upstairs to change and were up there maybe 5 minutes and when we went to open the door to leave and gamble there were 4 security guards at our door saying they received a noise complaint. We told them we havent been here more then 5 minutes and they said well I dont know just came up here and then walked us downstairs. I literally felt like I was in a jail or something the treatment we received off the bat! Y'all are MORE concerned about masks then the hospitality of your guests!    So the next day we went to the pool since it was 115 degrees outside and so we find some lounge chairs and I have my mask on my ear since I brought my water bottle down and was taking a sip of my water and this mask patrol person comes around and says you need to have your mask on at all times... I said Ok I understand just drinking my water I will put it on in a second... She said put it on now or leave or get in the water. I was thinking.. wow... this is a joke! I am paying to be here? So we packed our things and went back to our room..    The next day (Friday) my husband went downstairs to gamble so I tried going to bed around 10pm and there were so many parties going on in our corridor it was noisy and I was fed up! so I packed up some things and went downstairs to try and get a different room.. I see on hotels.com that the rooms were going for $139 a night... when I got to the front desk the lady said the only rooms left at $205 a night. I was so heated I said fine I will take it! So I get my room key and head towards the elevators and usually in the past at this hotel (I have stayed at this property for work and personal over 50 times) they have had security in each hallway making sure you have a room key... well I walk to the hallway for the 28th floor elevator and these two juveniles (maybe 21 years old) run into the elevator with me! They are basically staring me up and down - my purse was open since I just paid for another room.. and I had my wedding rings on obviously and they are just staring at me making me extremely uncomfortable (you have thought I knew them they were so close to me) so the elevator doors open and they slowly start to follow me and then said thats a nice bag you have... wheres your wallet? and this guy corners me and luckily this gentlemen was leaving his room... I started crying and said please help me and once the guy came to my rescue these guys took off running down the hall! I have NEVER in my life been so scared.. let alone disgusted with this hotel and the lack of security and etc.    Over all.. 6 hours later I go to check out and not even does the lady ask me.. how was your stay... I just was so disappointed with everything that I ended up paying an extra $600 to get us on a earlier flight home.
10,Be prepared for the pool area to feel like a covid prison lockdown. If your mask comes off more than 2 steps before entering pool you’ll be harassed. If you get out of the pool without a mask in hand someone will run over and require one be put on immediately. If your mask looks like it might be falling down someone will remind you to pull it up. Rules rules rules regarding covid and everything else under the sun. Employees seemed unhappy and were not polite. Chances are you’ll be disappointed in this new Las Vegas.
40,I stayed his several times and it's always been impeccable very clean staff is so friendly love the pools with the sand beaches and the restaurants are inside are great you really have to see it for yourself
50,I love the Mandalay Bay. I just find it to be a really nice (but not over the top) property that is very relaxing since it is located on the Southernmost end of the strip. The inside fittings are also quite classy in my view. Sure there are aspects of inconvenience in being located down the south end but it all comes down to what you are seeking. For example this property is very airport convenient or convenient to the South Premium Shopping Outlet or to some of the southern located off-strip casinos like South Point etc... And there is the free tram that get's you up to Excalibur where you can access MGM grand NYNY etc... Anyway this place is my cup of tea and I like it. Visit and see what you think.
40,Booked a stay here because it’s consistently rated as one Vegas top 10 pools. From the bell hop to check in it was pleasant quick and the staff was wonderful. Hotel was clean and everyone we encountered was very helpful. Went to our room and it was clean and gorgeous. Very pleased. Went down to the pool and was bummed to find out the wave pool can only be used by ANYONE 48” or taller regardless if a parent is with the child. I came with little kids specifically because it has a wave pool only to find out you can’t use it until your 10 years old. That was a real let down. I felt very mislead by all the websites touting what an amazing pool complex it is if you can’t use all of it with your children. Unfortunately Covid has ruined another part of our lives and very few people are allowed in the lazy river at one time so lines to get in get long and tiresome in the heat. Plan on spending 10-30 minutes waiting to get into the lazy river. Aside from those two let downs the stay was great we had a blast and we really enjoyed the hotel. I will be back here.
40,The good  Digital check-in was great extremely quick and no hassle! The room was nice spacious and clean! The cleaning ladies were very polite and have a great attitude. CJ a pool server could not do enough for you thank you!    Not so good  Smell of cannabis despite the hotel being a non-smoking  The resort fee there is a lot of this resort not open currently - including tram which makes the hotel pretty far out  The aquarium you have to book?? Tried visiting twice both days fully booked.. never have I heard of booking such an attraction. We visited many other attractions with no problem at all would dread to think what it’s like in peak season  Mask police by pool even approaching a couple whilst eating asking if we would like masks but if you are a group of men you can do what you like
20,The check in staff are very helpful and friendly and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. However other staff consistently provided incorrect information when asked for assistance. None of the restaurants currently open take reservations and the pool/beach facilities are awful. Maintenance is also lacking: the lights in our bathroom stopped working twice water soaked the floor around the ice machine the whole duration of our stay and we noticed many other problems around the hotel and casino. The maid service did a wonderful job with our rooms but trash thrown in the hallways was slow to be removed; in location it remained there for three days.
10,First and last time I’ll stay at this crappy hotel. $41 per day “ resort/aka ripoff fee”. They allow guest to keep dogs that bark non stop in their rooms ( woke me up at 11 pm). The maid just left the dirty towels on the bathroom no new ones. They’ll charge you $10 to use the in room coffee machine. Don’t even thing about using the I room fridge!! $50 per day!!! The bathrooms have mold and the TV would dim  then get bright again.
20,I would have to say of all the hotels over the years this is hands down the slowest check in process. with 11 people ahead of me and 3 Front desk agents open it took nearly an hour to check in. The lady who checked me in was nice . However we were approached my security who said that my grandson had to have a mask. When I told him that he has medical breathing issues the security went full blastic on us saying it was private property and we had to do what he said. Better read up on the laws I don't care if your public or private you want to mandate someones death? The room itself was beautiful.
40,Overall this stay was good and we enjoyed our post lock down getaway. The hotel did a good job operating in the face of Covid. Sure some things are just not the same but it is a pandemic. This review is a bit long but it contains some helpful hints if you are going to stay here.    MGM Resort app / Digital room key:  After reading several bad reviews of the app and the digital room key we decided to try our luck. And well it was about 50%. As soon as we landed in Vegas the app notified me that the room was ready; at this point I felt good about our odds. We arrived at the hotel about 930pm found the elevators used the digital key to select the floor in the elevator (another good sign) and headed up to the room. To my surprise the digital key would not work on the door lock so back down to the front desk to get the tradition room key. It’s a good idea but it seems like they still have some bugs to work out. In my opinion do yourself a favor and get a real room key.    Room:  The room was good; clean functionally maintained and supplied with a cool Covid pack (masks hand sanitizer etc.). The main quirk was the mini bar. It was stocked but you were not allowed to store your own beverages in it. It would have been nice to have a microwave which would be helpful during Covid times.    Pool:  The pool area opens at 9am and I would suggest getting there before that time because there will be a line. We got in with no issues but everyone (except your kids) will need a room key to get in (another reason for a key card). Pool towels are available after you pass through the checking area. They do seem to have a lot of pool chairs and they are spaced pretty well. However every chair was filled very quickly. Shaded chairs are hard to find. We found some by the food area. The shade lasted until about noon. Also you will be required to wear a mask everywhere in the pool area. The only exception is going to and from the pool and in the pool itself. So if you plan to work on your tan you will have some funny face tan lines. The drink service seemed a little under staffed. With the exception of staff walking around with mask boxes and enforcing the mask rules. That being said our chairs were next to a route that the servers traveled so we easily flagged down a great server. She really took care of us. Another hint bring your ID if you plan to drink.    Misc:  There are plenty of places to eat both in the Casino and in the shopping area connected to the casino.    Check out was at 11 and it was a breeze you could check out using your TV.    Again overall this was a good getaway experience for us.
40,Our family stayed at Mandalay Bay Las Vegas in July this year. I needed to put some of my groceries in their refrigerator (mini bar) in the room. So I took the drinks out to make some room there and put them back later on. Never used or opened any of their minibar stuff.  Few hours after checking in I noticed that besides the regular security deposit almost 300 USD was booked from my bank card for using the hotel mini bar. We got it settled when we checked out from the hotel but the money was released 2 weeks later. Just wanted to tell that be careful they probably have weight sensors that automatically charge you when items are removed from the mini bar. And if you have a non US bank card (I had debit card from EU) you might not have access to your money for long time. It's a nice hotel with awesome pools etc but stuff like this leave a bad memory.
20,Be very aware if you were lucky enough to snag a cheap price for a room here during the height of the Rona closures. I was able to snag a reservation for $60 a night back in May. But I definitely got the little that I paid for. When I checked in at 4:00PM on Friday there was about 50 people in line. Normal for Vegas on a Friday in the summer. But there were only 2 Front Desk people. After I saw that debaucle I checked in online. But after I went through the whole check in process I got a message no room was available. After an hour I called couldn't get anyone to answer. Then after 3 hours I still didn't have a room assigned. So I called again. Finally they were able to give me a room. I'm not sure about the opinion of others but waiting for a room for 3 hours after you check in seems very unreasonable. Not to mention if I wouldn't have called would they ever have assigned me a room? Then the app gives you no instructions. Zero. They give you a digital key but it doesn't work in the elevator. Again with zero instructions on the app I had to look like an idiot waving my phone on the proximity reader in the elevator expecting it to work. Finally I went to the Front Desk again still about 25 people in line. Thankfully an employee came up to me in line and I was able to let him know that I was already checked in but didn't understand why the digital key didn't work in the elevator. Again there is no information in the app. He looked at me like I was an idiot because I made the assumption that the digital key would work in the elevator. He let me jump the line and gave me two regular keys but still was not very friendly. And this begs the question what the heck is the purpose of the Digital Key if it doesn't work in the elevator? It might open the door to the room when you finally get to the floor but if you can't unlock the elevator to go to your room then what is the point of it?  Housekeeping never knocked on our door. We had the DnD sign off the door for a good portion of the day each day with the cart right next door but still no service offered. Not even a knock on the door to change the towels. Went to the House of Blues restaurant. Sat down and ordered wings. They didn't bring us napkins nor did they bring us silverware. Funny thing is little did they know that I was a local.  They might get some repeat business if this didn't automatically assume I was a tourist and not care how the service was. You definitely get the feeling that the employees are unhappy at the situation and being more unfriendly than usual as Strip employees are not known for their hospitality anyway. But I would think that they should at least be thankful they still have a job. The only compliment I will give them in the wave pool was a lot of fun Irish Pub in the Shoppes was great as well. But again beware that if you get a cheap rate you are most likely going to get cheap service. I will never return to this hotel based off this experience.
30,As returning guests to the Mandalay Bay we were disappointed overall. Part of our disappointment was probably expecting more but also was our overall stay. Our check-in was fine you need to wear mask in public areas our temps were taken prior to check-in. A quick check of the lobby/casino area showed some restaurants were closed lounge areas were open but bars were closed to seating. You had to order food to get a drink in the lounge not a big deal just order pretzels. There were adults driving electric scooters throughout the lobby some carrying boom boxes. These were not because of a disability they were being used as toys. With people and children walking about they proved to be dangerous nothing was said even though we observed one individual kick open the lobby door with his foot and drive to the outside. This was not the Mandalay we had enjoyed in the past. Our room was on the 29th floor for two days we observed the same plastic bags with food garbage on the floor in the elevator bank area No one came to remove it. We told a young lady (employee) about it when we were checking out she apologized and stated she would take care of it. I needed to speak with a front desk person upon checking out I approached the individual who firstly was behind a partition which I understood she also had a cloth mask on which I understood but also had a face shield which I thought was a bit much as I could not understand a word she said. I then needed to speak with someone else because I did not know what had just happened with my checkout certainly not the Mandaly Bay I knew. We knew things would be different but going forward it will be a while before we venture to Las Vegas again. Very sad indeed we really expected more from the Mandalay Bay.
50,They took all precautions. It is as the far end of the strip and the monorail isn’t running so just wanted to touch on that. Other than that it was stunning. The rooms are big. The pool is great (get there early since they limit capacity). Highly recommend the cabanas. Not much shade if you don’t rent an umbrella and chair or a cabana but the pools are unbeatable! Stunning pools. Staff was super friendly. Totally going back! Also they have great service our tv wasn’t working and they sent up someone right away to fix it. Felt safe the whole time. We will be back
50,Once again Mandalay Bay and Delano made my last Las Vegas mini vacation a great time. The room was cleaned and kept in top shape. Housekeep does a really good job and everyone is really friendly and always willing to help.
10,The check in process was very cold and unfriendly. The hotel was packed with people and seemed very unsafe considering the pandemic. The pool was extremely busy with no available chairs and unsafe with the number of people in the pools. There were no chairs available in shaded areas or with umbrellas unless you paid for a $385 cabana. We ended up leaving to avoid the unsafe conditions. They should be ashamed of themselves for packing people in like they are during a pandemic. Staff in general was unprofessional especially in the pool area.
50,This was our first time at the Mandalay Bay but it will not be the last. We are once/twice a year visitors at MGM Resorts and we were able to get a completely comped room (no resort fees) with some dining and gambling credit. The room was the Skyview One Bedroom Suite #62507. We loved it! Kitchen powder room seating/couch area with tv and floor to ceiling windows. The separate bedroom was spacious with a desk and and large bathroom with L'Occitane products! And trust me we Ioaded up on those. We believe this class of room was available to us only because of the Covid going on right now. The hotel was not crowded and there were only a few restaurants open but we really enjoyed our stay. If you don't mind flying and wearing a mask in the casino you will likely get a great deal on a great room.
20,Booked 3 rooms and a pool cabana to celebrate 50th birthday with my kids. Checked in early one room ready. Great. Get an email that second room was ready about an hour after arrival.Cool. Hour or so goes by call front desk said it would be another hour. No third room 4 1/2 hours after check in time which is 3PM. Decided to go to front desk to ask about my third room. They apologized but room just became available no notification 4 hours after check in time begin. The best part is that it is down the hall away from my kids who occupied other two rooms. And I missed 50th birthday dinner reservation. They felt bad so they comped my resort fee for one night at $39! Yes you read correctly 3 rooms for two nights and a $600 pool cabana reservation to miss my milestone birthday dinner reservation with a $39 credit. If you don't have the housekeeping staff available to clean and turn over rooms then don't book rooms! I shouldn't have spent my evening waiting around the lobby for a text from you for a room that should have been available hours ago. Mandalay isn't ready to be open. They Cosmopolitan. My sister in law got upgraded to a suite!
40,My adult daughter and I traveled to Las Vegas for a four day get away. We are seasoned Vegas travelers so we knew mostly where we wanted to go and what we wanted to do. With all the restrictions we knew it was going to be different. Mandaly Bay definitely knew what they needed to do. There were hand washing stations throughout the casino masks gloves and sanitizer available several places. When we arrived at our room there was a little bag with masks sanitizer and a little tool to make us feel secure. Very easy mobile check in and out. Keep in mind that bars are not open and just a few restaurants are. Shops also have limited hours. One thing we were not counting on was the monorail and train being closed. We spent more than we anticipated on uber and lyft rides. Overall MGM did a great job keeping guests safe while still being able to enjoy the casino and pool.
20,Arrived at 2:30 a little early from Detroit hungry ready to settle in and hit the town yet room is not ready time here is 4pm 7pm Michigan time we have our luggage still jst waiting in the casino #not happy
20,This review is to really highlight the good and the bad for our trip to Mandalay Bay in July 2020.    Check in appeared to be smooth the front desk attendant was able to merge our 2 reservations into one however that seemed to complicate thing on night one when my husband tried to sign the checks charging to our room as the first night was only in my name so I had to sign everything. Back to check in temperatures were taken and we were off to our room. The room was nice it was clean the view was beautiful and the bed was super comfy. The negatives on the room were the lack of room service I understand the Covid times however the ability to locate housekeeping to get fresh towels was difficult at times. As great as the room was our TV was broken generally not an issue in Vegas as we didn't go there to watch TV however we do use it to fall asleep. The last thing I will say about my room was - the smell of marijuana protruded into our room daily and continued down the hall to the elevator. The contact high we felt was enough to deter the urge of going to the local dispensary.    Dining: Eating at off times was difficult in the hotel and casino. There was no problem getting breakfast however if you wanted a mid day snack or a snack after 11pm you were out of luck. the restaurants that were open were scarce. Night one the website indicated the food court was open we walked down to the food court to learn that the only place open was Subway! That doesn’t constitute the entire food court being open… I didn’t come to Vegas to eat subway…. We found a mexican food place that was pretty good to hold us over until our reservations at strip steak. I read on their site that they had the best potatoes.. We had a 5 pm reservation and already had our meal picked our party of 4 wanted steak frites. They sounded amazing so to our surprise when we tried to order them the server indicated they were only for happy hour (we were within the happy hour time) and could not order them unless we moved to the other side of the restaurant which was literally 10 steps over.. No worries we moved and enjoyed our beer and steak frites. The problem with this situation is the menu did not indicate this could not be ordered while in the lounge rather than restaurant portion of the facility.    Pool: Was nice the music was good however the hype about them having the best pool isn't what its seems to be.  Day 1 We attempted to check out the pool however the line was a 2 hour wait so we passed not that.  Day 2 We got up super early as we were told the pool would be at capacity by 9 am. We found a nice spot to chill and ordered some Bloody Mary's and shared a burrito. we repeated this on day 3. The Bloody Mary's were pretty good and the burrito was plenty big for my husband and I to share for breakfast. That day we decided on day 4 we would like to sleep in a bit. We looked into renting a cabana for our group of 8. Called concierge and was given he run down that the pool area was not toptional...We were fine with that. that was the only input that was given to us over the phone. We chipped our money together and was excited to have the cabana and some extra sleep the next day. The attendant did not mention anything else about coming or going changes to what is stated on their website etc. The website indicated that the cabana came with non alcoholic beverage and water we learned this was not the case once we arrived - we were told by the host this was due to Cover -19 however we learned that was not the case for all patrons as we spoke with individuals who were able to obtain beverages without an additional cost. Additionally we were given a wrist band but told if we left the pool area we were not able to come back - we paid for a full day cabana this didn't make any sense to us. While standing in line to enter the pool the day before we saw groups of people entering the pool area and just flashing their wrist bands and got in no problem. There seems to be a discrepancy there! One of our group members had to run to the little store at the front of the pool area and the cabana host had a staff member escort them to the store and waited for them to make their purchase. So humiliating!    Spa: I can't comment on that because we were told it was closed although it appeared to be open when passing by.    Casino: The casino is nice and big. I am not sure how it is normally as this was our first time visiting but it appeared to be empty with minimal tables open. The tables that were open started from $10 and up.    Covid related: The casino was gracious to provide masks in our rooms and had hand washing stations and hand sanitizer throughout the casino. The staff would walk around reminding you to place your mask over your mouth if you had it down to long between drinks or smokes.    Customer service: I would hardly say the hotel is taking care of their patrons to the best of their ability. We had friends who had trouble with their first room - the air conditioner broke in the middle of the night (it was above 100deg) they were told someone would be up shortly my friend waited up until 5am and finally went back to sleep when no one showed. The brought this to the front desks attention the next morning and they were allowed to change rooms. The second room had no hot water. They brought that to their attention and went about their day as the hotel advised it would be fixed before the day was over. This was not the case. They brought it to the front desks attention at check out and were told they would be comped for their troubles only to find out when they got home the charges were never comped. In regards to my room the broken TV and the marijuana and the cabana issue we too were told we would be comped.. We did get comped but it was minimal and the charges to my credit card were confusing as it appeared the $400 deposit was the charge. I emailed account receivable back and forth over a period of a week and finally was able to speak with someone who advised she would get in touch with customer service to make it right however I have yet to hear back from them.    We go to Vegas a few times a year and stay at both MGM and Caesars properties it is rare that the level of give a sh*t is so low. I understand it is stressful times however customer service should be a top priority. We will be back in Vegas soon but I am not sure I will make my way back to Mandalay Bay again.
30,The hotel has everything you need for a wonderful vacation. Lots of things to do and see. Staff was amazing. Pools were so much fun. Rooms were nice but not over the top. The hotel did everything they could to keep us safe. Hand washing stations masks limiting the number of people at the pools took our temperature when we checked in ect. Drinks and food were very expense. I would recommend having alcohol and snacks delivered by Vons. Bring your own inter-tub so you don't have to buy one for $27 to go down the lazy river. If you want to be close to other hotels I recommend staying somewhere else. This hotel is on the end of the strip. I wanted a quite sunny vacation and that's exactly what I got.
10,We decided to bring our sons family to this casino to celebrate his 30th birthday and have some fun in the pool. They are not really open although they charge you full price for everything. The internet and tv have been not working for the past two days. I got stuck in an elevator with my mobile key on my phone and couldn’t get off. It’s 106 and the ice machine on my floor doesn’t work. The drain in my shower is plugged. Tried to order room service and nobody answered. I could go on and on but why. I complained and they just blame it on the virus. I think Mgm is in the casino business and not in the hospitality business. What really bothers me is the staffs attitude they must be treated like crap and as a result it’s comes across to the guests. Doesn’t matter where you go in the property the mask police are everywhere. Never been to Russia but it’s got to be close.    Stay home and wait for a vaccine
40,This is my second stay in months.    The electronic check in is the worst. I arrived before 3pm ( official check in time). I had to wait an hour for an text saying my room was ready. However people waiting in line for a real person got rooms immediately. Upon notification of my room being ready the telephone key wouldn't work. I ended up going to the desk for a key. In my opinion the entire electronic check in was sub par.    The beds were comfortable. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the soaking tub. The room was nicely equipped. Cleaning services were provided which is a bonus for the Corona times.    The pool was very well organized with their covid precautions. Constantly reminding people about masks and readily providing them. The pool staff were very professional and friendly in their enforcement.    I will stay again but I will certainly not utilize the electronic check in again.
40,We've been to Vegas many times and stayed at a variety of properties but this was our first stay at MB.    Used the contactless check in through the app and it was fine. Our room was ready early which was great. I had requested a high floor and we were assigned to the 10th floor. It wasn't as high as we would have liked but it was fine. The room was immaculate and well appointed. I love a tub and the tub did not disappoint. I would suggest the addition of a body wash or bubble bath.    Of course as with all MLife properties no fridge or coffee maker. There is a convenient coffee shop Hazel just off the guest elevators and there was hardly a line.    The casino is huge. Usually after a day or so we get the lay of the land but even on our last day we were still getting a little lost. Not a complaint it just means there is a lot of offer.    Due to Covid there were limited dining options everywhere you went. We did have a chance to try Citizens and it was fine. We also did room service one night and it was prompt which was great.    The staff everywhere was amazing and did a great job of reminding difficult people to put on their masks. Extra shout outs to the friendly people all over the pool area who had to work in 115 degree heat with a mask and always kept a great attitude.    Drink service was almost non existent but I attribute this to the issues relating to Covid. I imagine the property doesn't want to give people many more reasons to pull down their masks.    A few complaints: During Covid I think drinking and smoking should be prohibited in the casino. It just gives people an excuse to not wear one. Appoint a smoking section for the smokers and people can drink in restaurants and in their rooms. Also I have never seen so many kids in Vegas. It was nuts. Kids also don't seem to be great at wearing masks properly and practicing social distancing. The local casinos by us have banned smoking and kids for this reason and it would be great if the properties in Vegas did too. Getting in and out of the pool with 10 kids sitting at the stairs makes maintaining distance difficult.    Otherwise MB is a great property. Next time I'd like a higher floor but otherwise it was great. We can't wait to come back post-Covid!!
10,The bathroom we had was completely disgusting. I am a bath taker and couldn’t take a bath due to the filth it had. Tried calling down to front desk several times couldn’t get ahold of anyone. The line was extremely long just to talk with someone. There were little black bugs on the side of the tub and dried blood on the wall next to the tub. With covid and having our room sealed once cleaned was disturbing know it was still nasty. Not happy with this hotel.
40,We loved the resort and room itself. The restaurants are very nice and access to the shops through Luxor and then Excalibur is really nice.    Proximity to the pool and the pool itself really couldn’t be better.    Check in was really bad had to manually check in after mobile check in and a two hour wait and most of the staff really weren’t helpful at all.
30,"Well....what can I say the beds were comfy...but that is about it. The check- in process was a nightmare and took over 45 minutes to get helped. COMPLETELY unacceptable! The rooms are quite dated and the property seems drab and sad. It seems the property is way over its ""glory days."" We were not allowed in the pool because it was over capacity did not seem to want to return the outrageous ""resort fee"" rip off. The majority of ""guests"" seemed sketchy. I would not stay here again. We keep giving these sub-standard ""luxury"" resorts a chance only to be extremely disappointed. Of course our place is the Wynn or the Encore-----WELL worth the extra money."
20,I wasnt sure what to expect with a post-COVID return to Las Vegas. The Mandalay Bay has always been an exquisite and upscale property so we trusted that we could return to Vegas safely and boy were we disappointed. Don't get me wrong - they provide masks and hand sanitizing stations at all of the casino entrances which is a huge bonus. The room was still dirty - like candy stuck to the floor by the window what appeared to be blood-stained sheets and hair in the shower stall. The staff and service while still adjusting to all the pandemic changes are few and far between. Most we encountered were polite but the wait to get to cashiers slot service or drink service is at times unbearable. Unfortunately it was a trip spoiler all around. The bright spot is the pool service. 11 acres of heat-busting fun! The pools have accommodated to the changes well and everyone we encountered there was amazing!
10,"We get to the Hotel Monday and we are tired from plane/uber rides and want to eat at a restaurant guess what? There are NO restaurants open. I went up to the conceierge and I was like ""where do all these ppl eat""? and she was like ""our restaurants are open"" which was total BS!    in a nut shell read this before booking:  - Yes the pool area is terrible you will wait 2 hours to get into the lazy river because of a long line. The wave pool only makes a wave every 2 minutes and it's freezing cold and uncomfortable and the lifeguards are rude.  - no restaurants to eat at you have to walk up the strip to find groceries and food  - The maids are understaffed we had to find them in the hallways to get more shampoo and towels.  - The staff didn't seem to know what was going on  - No dealers to play card games with  - They tried to charge me for the mini fridge when i didn't buy anything  - Final complaint that has nothing to do with the Hotel but the transportation is really bad we were stuck on the strip for an hour because we couldn't get a cab/uber which makes one feel somewhat helpless.    save your hard earned money and go when things are normal but I still won't come back to Mandalay Bay."
10,My family and I checked in on Sunday 7/5. After a mobile check in we went to our room. If you do a mobile check in they don't take your temperature. We got to our rooman Elite King and as we opened up the couch/bed we found food in it. Tried calling guest services and it did nothing but ring for 45 minutes. Sent our two 16 year olds to the pool only for them to be told there would be a 3 hour wait. Seriously? What am I paying a resort fee for? So my husband and I went and waited 45 minutes to speak to a manager about our dirty room. We were told that housekeeping would be right up. 4 hours later housekeeping arrived to take a towel and throw the food on the floor of the room. Are you kidding me? So I was left to pick up the food off the floor. Later that night we all get ready to take showers and guess what no cold water. It's well over 100 degrees in Vegas and the pipes are hot. None of us can take a shower. We call again..... surprise......no answer. We go wait again to speak to someone about not even being able to shower. Lizzy was great upgraded us to a clean room with a shower we could use. Also should add that about 90% of the hotel restaurants are closed. There is 1 Starbucks for the entire hotel.  Food is being left outside of guest rooms for days. The stink is unbelievable. Housekeeping is leaving bags of trash in the hallways for days.    My family and I go here every year. Spend a fair amount of money. Mandalay is not ready for guests.  On our last day entering the pool area a 5 foot metal sign blew over on to my hand. It immediately swelled up and bruised. Security came and took down my name and room number. Haven't heard from them since.  I guess what I'm trying to say is......again......Mandalay is not ready for guests. Save your money.
20,I couldn’t wait to get home after this trip. The hotel had very little food options open. We had one meal at house of blues. The staff seem angry at being there. The food was overly salted and dry I did not finish my bbq chicken. The skillet cookie dessert I had had gummy chocolate ice cream on it it must have been left open during the Coronovirus. But You can clearly see part of the ice cream is dried why scoop that and serve it to me? Why not scoop under the freezer dried ice cream? No it wasn’t caramel or fudge swirl ask me how I know. The two meals we had at RiRa was hit or miss. There were no other options nearby. NONE. The room had a few dirty spots making me go over surfaces with cleaner to be sure it was sanitized. Casino slots were very tight lost a lot of money with no fun play. Could not get a bonus over 200$ after putting in 1k. This trip was a huge mistake should have waited. Went home hungry annoyed at wasting time and money and more tired in a bad way than I arrived.
10,"This was my first time and my last time to this resort. I checked in on my phone which was a fantastic idea until I got there and realized it's a great way to spread the Coronavirus. They have no limit on the amount of people that can load onto the elevator and you have to put your phone up against this sensor thing to access your room floor. So everyone's phone is touching this sensor thing and spreading germs. The room's carpet was dirty and the sinks where filthy with dirt and toothpaste. The remote control had a holder that said ""sanitized for your protection"" and was absolutely caked in dirt and the grime. It was by far the dirtiest remote-control I had ever seen. Not a deal-breaker but the TV was mounted on the wall crooked and would drive some people crazy.    We paid extra to check in early to be able to use the pool and went down to only be told there was a waiting list to get in. We decided to go to the food court while we waited and discover they only had Subway open. This resort has like 4000 rooms and only had Subway open in there food court. After two hours we finally got a text saying we where able to use the pool. The pool area is awesome but make sure you wear flip-flops because you will burn the crap out of your feet on the concrete and sand. You have to buy a tube to float in the lazy river.($25.00) The lazy river was jammed packed even with the Coronavirus going on. My son's glasses got knock off by the waterfall that comes down in the lazy river and no on staff seemed to care. The lifeguard just shrugged her shoulders when I told her what happened. I told another staff member and she said check lost and found. Luckily another guest found the glasses but they had been stepped on. We headed back to our chairs to discover that our towels and all our personal belongings where gone!! There was plenty of empty chairs so I am not sure what happened to our stuff.    I would definitely not return to this resort."
50,Came here for the 4th of July right when Vegas reopened from COVID19. Masks and hand sanitizers were everywhere and social distancing implemented. I felt safe it was clean and we had a damn good time! Met lots of other couples just so happy to be out of the house and in the sun. Amazing trip! Thanks Mandalay Bay
50,My 4th or 5th time at Mandalay Bay and was very enjoyable.    This is a nice property with a lot of options of things to do. The pools are great for my teenagers and my wife. Mall attached to the resort. Went back right after they re-opened. Had a lot of spacing masks and hand sanitizer. I felt safe as just about everyone was wearing a mask. Those that did not - the employees kindly asked them to.
40,We enjoyed our stay at Mandalay Bay. Great rooms comfy bed clean great strip-view fun pools lots of hand sanitizer. Wished there were more people staffing pool restaurant and more open restaurants. Overall a great pick. Tram to Luxor and Excaliber was helpful but it had limited hours. Riding the tram or taking an uber to the other areas of the strip worked but we were disappointed about the tram's limited hours. We were there the first we after reopening in July though so my guess is the hours and restaurants will soon expand.
20,I always like staying at the Mandalay Bay but this time it was the worst experience 😒 check-in was a nightmare the line barely moved..I had to get out of line after 30 minutes and do mobile check-in. It put me on the 13th floor I'm not a Superstitious person but I thought hotels skip the 13th floor. I booked a King Elite suite for more space the room was a bit outdated the furniture was stained bathroom light switch had brown dirt on it I'm assuming it was 💩 luckily I had my own disinfectant cleaning products. The pool had a waiting list 2-3 hours they will text you if they had more room to let you in ...we never got to see the pool my daughter cried for hours! This hotel had no where to eat! I didn't want to go back to my car to the parking garage which is a 15 minute walk not to mention waiting 15 minutes in the garage in 110 degrees waiting on the elevator to open. I ordered room service for cheeseburger and chicken strips two lemonades cost 87.00$ I wish I would had just stayed an extra day at the palazzo there was never any staff sanitizing anything go to palazzo or bellagio they wipe down everything. Picture I uploaded shows a dirty chair very dissatisfied
50,Having stayed in Vegas many times we always avoided Mandalay Bay based on its distance down the strip but having stayed there recently it has now become one of our favourites!  For a video review of our room please head over to You.Tube and search for 'Tim and Matt's Travel Reviews' for this and other resorts.    So let's start with the location. It is the resort farthest south of the strip so if walking it does take a while to get to and from. You can walk outside or use the connecting bridges to Luxor and Excalibur. There is also a free monorail that connects to Luxor and Excalibur which take only a minute to get you there. Thanks to both the monorail and the connecting bridges Mandalay Bay didn't actually feel as far as it is.    The casino floor is a huge 'square' shape with bars in the centre and dotted around. The ceilings are high meaning it does feel a little less smokey than some of the others. Also late at night if there are no events on it is quieter than some of the central resorts which you may find as a positive or negative.    There is a food court which is a bit of a trek away from the main floor and when we went for breakfast early it wasn't open so ended up grabbing a Starbucks of which there are a few.    There is a huge convention centre but we did not use this. The pool areas look fantastic and has a large wave pool and real sand beach which can get very busy as it is often hailed as one of the best pools in Vegas.    Our room was fantastic. We received a great deal from M-life for a two bedroom suite which for the three of us that visited provided a mass of space for us with some amazing views. Our room faced the Raiders Stadium but also provided views of the pools airport and the strip. The beds were super comfortable and the living areas provided loads of space - probably more than we needed!    Check in was fine nothing special but if you do find the queue is long there is a water fountain with cups nearby you can grab to have in line. The check in process did not take longer than was necessary. I did ask to have a different view but was told this was not possible due to my special offer which was fine as I didn't realise at the time we would still have a partial strip view!    Housekeeping was always excellent and the general cleanliness of the resort was always of a good standard.    We visited just before the lockdown back in March and already there were plenty of anti-bac stations everywhere and I believe MGM resorts and Mandalay Bay are taking more precautions than some others as they re-open.    Would we recommend staying here? Yes! And we would stay here again.
40,I stayed here for a convention in July for a week and overall my experience was mostly exceptional. The service was very professional and helpful from checking in to staff around the convention center. I appreciated that it is at the south end of the strip so a little quieter and farther removed from the party scene. The lobby was very classy and I enjoyed how the casino was not the first thing you walk into but could be avoided if you were just going up to your room. You did have to walk through the casino to get to the convention center however. The elevator system was rather efficient with three elevator banks going to different sets of floors. Our room was very spacious with comfortable beds and a lovely bathroom. We had a nice large window view overlooking the pool area on a high floor. There were plenty of restaurant choices in different parts of the hotel and convention center including an Irish pub the house of blues an American style diner a really fabulous Japanese sushi restaurant and so many others. The pool area was a bit crowded but the wave pool was a fun experience and the lazy river was pleasant. Bring your own inner tubes if you are able as they are quite expensive to buy or rent. The convention center was laid out logically and was easy to navigate and the staff was always very efficient at set up and teardown. We did not have a chance to visit the shark reef aquarium but it looked fun. There is also a free tram between this hotel and the Luxor and Excalibur hotels. There is a designated spot to pick up Uber and Lyft down on the lower level. Beware not to take anything out of your mini bar refrigerator as you will absolutely be charged. Food is definitely not cheap here but I suppose that’s common in Las Vegas. Overall if visiting the city again I would definitely choose this hotel for its more relaxing scene and professional atmosphere.
40,Mandalay Bay is a great place to visit for anything you need. The casino is huge. Food options are plentiful with numerous restaurants (with a large diversity of food). Large convention area. Entertainment is excellent with shows as well as the Shark Reef.
40,Really enjoyed our stay here. The room was great the bed very comfortable.  The buffet was excellent. and not expensive.  Staff friendly and helpful.  Why they would want to aggravate their customers by charging $50 if you want to use the fridge I can't imagine.
50,Based at the south end of the strip this hotel is at the quieter end of the activity and so is an ideal base for those wanting a little time out from the hustle and bustle. Mandalay Bay is also not a themed hotel so it’s interior is classy and professional.    We had a room on the 53rd floor facing the airport which was great. We loved watching the planes fly in and out. Shame we couldn’t get a strip view but that probably would have cost a lot more.    Our room was an ‘accessible’ room and so had a huge walk down tub (big enough for two) as well as a large walk in shower (also big enough for two or three or four 🤣).    The bed was so very comfortable and I slept extremely well throughout my time there.    Food in the buffet restaurants was superb and service good too. Plenty of choice of flavours and international dishes as well as US favourites.    When staying at the Mandalay you can use restaurants at other hotels in the MGM group and charge to your room or use your daily allowance. It’s a fantastic idea which means you get to experience other hotels offerings. We also ate at Luxor which was pretty good too.    Casino was nice and clean.
50,It’s our yearly tradition to visit vegas around this time...first time at Mandalay Bay and wow!  Love the atmosphere and specially the staff. Very good experience with check in at the concierge mlife. Got a higher floor room without even asking for it. Restaurants were good specially Stripsteak! complimentary fries from tthe chef was awesome!! and the casino floor had really good luck vibes for us lol. Very Good customer service overall. Room is amazing-Strip view lots of  closet space and love the lights/bathroom mirrors.  Overall I would definitely stay here again but going to my favorite resort back in June first...Aria 😊
50,Our trade association has held their convention at Mandalay Bay more years than I can rememeber. The hotel is well-connceted at the south end of the strip close to the airport and city passenger rail. Whole foods is about 2 miles away The converntion hall iis an easy indoor walk skirting the gambling floor. The resteraunts are decent. the pool is huge and great for kids or adults. There Irish Bar down the elvated hall is fun with good pub-grub. The only downside is the Vegas obligatory charge for just opening the tiny refridgertor (sigh).
50,Traveled for a convention right before everything was shut down. We've only stayed at Caesar's Palace in the past and honestly...I didn't really enjoy the Caesars experience that much. We felt it was way over-priced.    For the money we spent..I thought it was a Mandalay Bay was a great hotel. Love how you could walk to connect to Luxor and Excaliber then easily walk to a bunch of others (New York MGM etc) Really liked the location. While walking through Luxor and Excalliber...I felt that Mandaly Bay was a MUCH better maintained property with better dining and drinking options. One day we walked all the way to New York for dinner and honestly wished we would have just stayed at Mandalay Bay.    Staff was super friendly helpful and made me want to come back again. The hotel is HUGE and the pool area is amazing. The weather didn't accommodate so we couldn't use the pool but I would say it's one of the best features of the property!    Would stay here again for sure.
30,The room was very clean. We already paid a resort fee and they wanted another $50 if you used the refrigerator. They also price gouged the snacks they left in your room $20 for a small bag of cashews $10 for a can of Pepsi. WOW!!! I realize we were in SIn City but REALLY!! I doubt we will stay here again!
10,Terrible stay. This was by far the worst stay I have ever had especially on our wedding weekend. We expected a lot more from Mandalay Bay especially with the dining experience. Food was closed shops closed early and to much more to say.
30,The Corona Virus was just taking off and the hotel felt flat. Employees were not engaged. The check in experience was horrible. The clerk was so rude and disinterested. The food was good everywhere. I had to stay another night and got a great rate online. I paid $225 for 4 nights and $69 for the last night.
50,The room was awesome. The service was just as good. I read alot of review's were people complained about being charged for the refrigerator and coffee machine if you ask questions before hand it wouldn't happen. Very happy with my stay.
20,While the rooms are spacious the restaurants are bland the gym is tiny and hotel is tired.    If the food wasn't so bad I would have given 3 stars.    There are much better and updated hotels with a better restaurant selection.
50,It was our 19th anniversary. This place is great it is very clean great food and the staff are very friendly. The casino was also very clean. We also won a little money. Thanks everyone at Mandalay Bay.
50,Love the rooms!! Hotel always smells great!! The staff is very friendly especially at Vip check in!!!!!  Gambling not that great but lots of machines!  Very close to the airport Great restaurants!!!!!
50,Friendly staff. Nice location. VERY family friendly. Went with a small group and had a great time. Casino staff was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. Restaurants vary according to taste but overall a good value if you look for it.
40,The resort is really beautiful and the rooms were lovely but the bathrooms are enormous and really nice. They have several pools that looked amazing but we didn't go swimming. The only drawback it that the resort fee is outrageous and the elevators are kind of a pain you need to hold your room key to a sensor in order to get the buttons to work and there is always a long wait for the elevator. The parking is kind of a trek and the elevators in the parking garage are really slow.
40,From the time of check in to the time of check out everything was great! My room was always cleaned and in order when I returned in the evening. The variety of dining was great as well. I used the cardio room daily and they have enough in there for me to get my workout on. Everything was easily accessible and the directional signs made it easy to navigate the hotel and conventions center.
40,We care to Vegas for a few days to get away and celebrate our toddlers 2nd birthday. She had a great time at the shark aquarium shopping and eating at the restaurants! We will hopefully be back in the summer.
40,Excellent housekeeping staff. Restaurants so so hash browns burnt at sea breeze restaurant and coffee horrible place but waiter very nice amazing ambiance thought prices were threw the roof 4.99 for coffee ridiculous
50,A first trip to this MGM property & it won't be my last! First class stay in a great hotel & casino!    Peter & Evagaline in Casino made the experience all that much better!    Great food at Libertine Social & drinks @ Rhythm & Riffs!    If the sun shone for more then 4 hours would have been that much better!
40,"We chose Mandalay Bay based on the House of Blues being located on its premises. The idea of just taking the elevator down to see Santana was way too convenient! Ironically we also caught the Michael Jackson ""One"" show that was there as well. The resort was nice with great cocktail lounges and live music every night.  What we particularly liked was being at the end of the strip which forced us to walk walk walk. And we did.  Room was large and nicely appointed."
30,"When we arrived the TV would freeze on certain channels. PAC-12 networks was important as we were there for the PAC-12 Women's Tournament. It took three calls and three different people to fix it. The first two guys just didn't want to be troubled by it. If they got another channel working they would say ""it working now"". When they would leave and I would put it back on PAC-12 we would have the same problem. The third guy took the time to figure out the problem. Room 12-231 was close to something that we could smell cigar smoke the entire time."
50,Was there for NCAA women's basketball tournament. From arrival to departure was treated with courtesy and friendliness. There are a variety of restaurants I particularly enjoyed breakfast at the buffet. My only peeve was the Resort Fee but unfortunately that is becoming common.
50,The casino is big but not too big. The pool area is beautiful. The rooms are pretty and clean. The staff is very helpful. I do think though they should have free coffee in the rooms and free water in the rooms.
20,Didn't like the buffet too limited maybe the stuff that it has is ok but it need more to offer omelette bar has just a few items  need more veggies more cheeses they guy is nice and kind but need more to offer Harrah's casino buffet is more completed and cheaper.great service still
50,Started off with amazing check-in staff then the room was gorgeous! The food options are delicious and the pool is paradise. I was lucky enough to get to try Fleur brunch! (Only served on Saturdays and Sunday’s and very worth it!) All in all it was a perfect Vegas day...
40,We loved our stay at the resort. The ease to just walk to the game and get food. We didn’t adventure outside much. Just one day to go to the m&m’s store for our granddaughters. We loved Kumi’s restaurant and ate there twice loved the cafe for breakfast. Thank you!
30,We got put in two queens instead of one king like requested. My husband is 250+ lbs and it’s not very comfortable sharing a queen...and we left 4 kids at home for 5 nights away not to sleep in separate beds. Also called ahead of time to ask about pools they said they were all open but the wave pool wasn’t.
50,So had this trip not been a mix of business and pleasure I would have canceled altogether. My birthday alone was not reason enough to keep the resetvation.  I arrived at the front desk in a DISMAL mood. Have just been injured endured (granted a predictable) long drive and a series of logisitcal nightmares... I wasnt all sunshine and rainbows at the front desk. I somehow failed to notice the relocated VIP checkin desk (Im not legit VIP just for some reason I always stay Platinum at MGM owned properties).  Anyway.  Michael greeted me with a quick wave a real smile and a great freakin attitude.  I wanted to whine but he deflected my negative nonsense offered me some upgrade options for a nominal fee and ultimately I took the best one at the biggest fee and said screw it I am gonna have a good time.  I did.  Thanks Michael!!!!!!  Also... the room. Wow. The service awesome.  Everyone was friendly. The room service was blah but who cares right???
50,Was fast check in did prior to arrival room was clean and roomy the buffet was great and service was excellent there. Great selection of slots to play  plenty of places to choose from for meals . Good location to see other sights as well. Had a great time
50,Great Customer Service! We had a wonderful stay. Due to an error that I made I needed to change our reservation. Sherita helped me correct my error taking the time to listen to my problem and had a solution which allowed me and my wife to have a wonderful stay. Mandalay Bay needs more employees like her. I'll definitely stay here again.
50,Excellent place to relax enjoy stay and play in Las Vegas!!  Don't miss out on a trip to the Mandalay.  Enjoy Water activities The Spa The Casino Shows and Entertainment and a Taste for every desire.
50,Recently stayed at Mandalay Bay for business. The room was great with an awesome view of the strip. Very clean and comfy. Enjoyed great food and drink. I like that you can still find a $10 blackjack table in the casino. Great place
50,Staying at the Mandalay Bay is like shopping on Amazon it has EVERYTHING! You never have to leave! Superb service friendly staff and very (I mean very) clean rooms. An added touch of detail was providing Purel stations at every turn to promote clean hands! Thank you Mandalay Bay for the great stay. I will return!
50,After many Vegas trip we decided to try the Manadaly Bay Resort and we were not disappionted. However check in was slow and the room we booked was not available at check in. Once we arrived in the room we called the front desk and they moved us to the type of room we paid for. Room was on the 12th floor with little view but was large clean and well maintained. The monorail system to other casinos was excellent.  We would stay at Mandalay Bay resort again if we return to Vegas.
10,Horrible experience at this hotel over the last 18 hours. My husband dined at a resort property restaurant last night and 4 hours later woke up violently ill. We are staying at Mandalay Bay as well. After being up all night with apparent food poisoning we started the morning first alerting the restaurant (who promptly tried to deny responsibility) then having to cancel our flights home then calling the front desk to extend our stay an additional night due to him being so ill. After speaking with the front desk manager in the morning  she let me know the hotel would need to send security to the room to file a report. The security guard said they would file the claim and he would call the hotel GM right away. I asked him to have the GM follow up with me and my phone number was provided.    We spent the afternoon at a local urgent care as he worsened and it was confirmed food poisoning he was given IV fluids and 3 prescriptions. We returned to the hotel later and on our way to the room returned to the desk to get our updated keys due to our extended stay. I asked the registrant when the manager would be contacting us and she said she would find out and again took my cell number. Over 2 hours later nothing!    I returned to the front desk and demanded to speak with a manager to understand what course of action I have. The manager stated he did not know he couldn't advise me and he had only been employed for about 1 month. I asked him to provide me the hotels insurance company and contact and he could not locate anything. He advised me to call the hotel's main number and try from there. It was completely useless and I am completely shocked at the lack of care here. So here we are stuck in a room that we are having to pay an additional night for due to eating a restaurant at this property.    We are here for a conference having to do with hospitality and the irony is this is the least hospitable experience we have ever had. I hope the management of this hotel see this post and takes food borne illness seriously. The last part of our entire trip has been ruined. Our rebooking fees with our airline the cost of extending our stay and medical costs have already exceeded thousands of dollars.    In light of the pandemic of the coronavirus seeing how this property has handled an illness that was caused by a restaurant on their property and their lack of follow through and caring I would avoid this property at all costs.
50,We really enjoyed our first visit to Mandalay Bay. We played in the wave pool and lazy river. The grounds were very tropical and clean. The country and 80’s dance bands at the bar played fun music. House of Blues service and food were excellent.
40,This was our first time staying at Mandalay Bay Resort; we had an exceptional time! Friendly staff very clean beautiful rooms and lots of amenities. We were there for the Women’s NCAA PAC 12 basketball tournament. The security and the staff were so impressive. We felt very safe and the stadium was being cleaned continuously. Highly recommended!!
50,Overall beautiful hotel & rooms are clean and up to date.Valet is nice and smooth well organized loved it. Friendly service Casino the only thing is that the drink service needs to improve that's all.
30,There are no free amenities in the room that you would expect in any motel-hotel. To use the in room coffee machine was $$. Personal use of the in room refrigerator was $50 per day or rent a fridge for $35/day. Late check out also had a fee based on length of check out time. Expect more out of a four star hotel.
50,This was our first stay at Mandalay Bay. We were attending the Pac-12 Women's Basketball Tournament. We had a wonderful time. There was so much to do that we never left Mandalay Bay during our stay. The room was comfortable and clean. The casino was fun. Sports book personnel were attentive and knowledgeable. There were plenty of dining and coffee options and the basketball facility was wonderful. We will stay again!
20,Our room was not serviced for two days room was loud due to airplanes and music from the Daylight pool area.  Food in restaurants was mediocre at best....good sports book for service. No refrigerator for my medications....$50. charge for mini bar frig use!
40,We had a good experience at Mandalay Bay the hotel is really nice has a lot of restaurants rooms are clean staff was friendly and it has what we expect from a 5 star hotel.  A little far from the strip but the tram works fine.
50,Best hotel experience in every area. Very friendly and helpful staff. Beautiful property!! Clean and exceptionally well maintained. We  Loved the beach!! The beach is great for kids as well. We decided we will not stay anywhere else when we come to Vegas .its such a beautiful view from our room.
20,I was did not enjoy the property at all. I thought it was out of the way the rooms were very weak. The food at dinner was try and tasteless. The servers at dinner were very friendly however. The Mlife people were ignorant and condescending.
10,This was a bad experience from the start. Lousy room in a noisy area. Room service took forever. Got charged $24 for 2 K-Pods for the coffee on the counter without any written notice of a charge. Front desk would not allow a late check-out despite room service delivery being over an hour late. This hotel is total horse manure!
50,What a fabulous hotel and venue for our real estate conference. Great service clean and spacious room accommodations and food food. Conference went very smoothly thanks to the production team that handled lightning sounds and effects. Thank you Mandalay Bay!
40,Nice hotel at the very southern end of Strip so be prepared to walk a bit further. Staff is by and large friendly and professional. Facility is clean and nicely appointed.    A few things that bothered us:  1) Daily resort fee of $39 (plus $5+ tax on top!) is a legal scam. Just build it into the room rates already.  2) Threatening customers with a $50 charge for storing personal items in the mini-bar refrigerator? Seriously?  3) Uber pickup area is inconvenient. Why not allow this in the main entrance area where all the taxis hang out?  4) Two items were stolen from our room on consecutive evenings apparently by a staff member who had access. Thankfully we locked up our valuables in the room safe. What else might be stolen from other rooms where this precaution was not taken?
10,Sadly the Mandalay Bay is now charging extremely high fees for valet workout facilities and every other area they can squeeze money out of their guests. The property itself has become a disappointment.
50,Was a really nice experience everything was excellent and because there is nothing to be complaint i would say that the only thing that is bad is the location but maybe for other people could be excellent.
40,I like this location that is a little ways from the busy strip. This hotel is a beautiful place with clean and comfortable rooms. They have lots of swimming pools and large conference rooms for groups.
50,If you are looking for a resort stay this is the property! We came for the PAC-12 Women's Basketball Tournament and was pleasantly surprised. We would stay here again. Also as a non-smoker this property smelled less of smoke than the others we went to during this trip.
40,Website while booking does not tell you. Until you mobile check in. Also room credit does not cover mini bar. Which is also not disclosed to you. So please prepare for undisclosed information when booking.
50,We have gone to Vegas many times in our marriage and have never had the customer service experience and stay like we had at Mandalay bay. A guy named Michael at the front desk checked us in and right from the start made us feel so cared for. He listened and you could tell has a passion for what he does. The whole process was a red carpet check in and we felt so important. From our suite to the pool & the food at the buffet.....It was all amazing and top notch! It was our first time at Mandalay Bay and we are already planning our next trip with our kids. We can't wait to come back!
20,We booked Mandalay Bay Resort exclusively for the Beach and pools. Their pool complex is huge and gorgeous but we weren’t able to enjoy it.    We chose Mandalay Bay because of the pools and checked the website before booking to confirm they were open. We went to our travel agent days later and she confirmed by phone with the resort the pools were open.    We got to Las Vegas and learned the pools closed the day before we got there and would open the day after we left. No sympathy from management no breaks no alternatives just a shrug and a lot of don’t care.    We will never go back!
50,Everything about this hotel was too notch! Very clean and luxurious and the pool was definitely a big hit with the family ! Great restaurants the aquarium was amazing and the hotel was conveniently located.
30,sold me online king size room and at check-in said that they can not provide it to me. I was forced to accept 2 queens room. I was checking in at 6 pm. No verbal apology was offered either. Very cold kind of reception of the guest. Just take it or leave it.
50,This was the first time we have stayed but have been there for conferences for the last several years. Everything from checking into the food in the cafe was great. We look forward to returning next year
10,"I book Delano Hotel and was sent to Mandalay Bay even though you took a 3 day deposit. I said I would be there at 11 PM came at midnight to find my room was gone. This is he second time this has happened. No call no apology just ""sorry sold out"""
20,I stayed at Mandalay Bay 1 week after it opened and continued to do so until our most recent trip. The resort has changed drastically not for the better for me. I expect more from a Las Vegas resort. We are going to try Aria for our future stays.
50,Nice well organized hotel and casino. Clean and well kept. The Players Club is a great way to get discounted stays food and free play. The casino area is easy to navigate with plenty of gaming and dining options.
40,I was concerned given some of the bad reviews. True - reception and check-in were hardly warm and welcoming. I was asked for ID credit card and once room keys were issued if I wanted a resort map. Beyond that no “enjoy your stay” or anything that would require moving more facial muscles. Certainly not a smile.  That being said I loved my room: 59-231 (34th floor now renumbered) - great view of the Strip but be warned the Strip rooms are probably too noisy for some due to the hotel’s proximity to the airport and also vehicle noise (yes... it’s audible that high up!). Didn’t bother me at all and I slept like a log in a very comfortable bed. Room and bathroom were nicely decorated and spotlessly clean - housekeeping staff very friendly and accommodating. Reception should take note!  As others have mentioned things are expensive. But it’s a hotel on the Strip in Vegas.. to be expected. Biggest bonus is the water fountain in the lobby that dispenses still and sparkling water for free so take your own bottle.  I ate at House of Blues (friendly quick service) and Kumi (average service good food). The rest of the Strip and other Vegas attractions are easily accessible on foot if you’re a walker or by taxi and rideshare.  After reviewing my account and checking out using the room tv I promptly received a summary of my folio via email.  All in all I enjoyed my stay. It definitely helps to sign up for the Mlife program - faster check in and out and discounts on rooms shows and exhibits.  I really have no complaints and wouldn’t hesitate to stay at Mandalay Bay on my next trip to Vegas.
10,Have travelled from Australia direct to Vegas and paid the $40 extra to get early access at 11am - timing all flights to allow for the least amount of waiting after a long trip. Not to be. After checking in via mobile before arriving I get to the hotel to be told a room was not ready and that they would refund the $40. Not the solution I was after. They could not give me any indication of when the room would be ready and because I have an Australian Mobile phone could not guarantee I would get an alert so to check my emails for a notice of when the room would be available. They did give me an alternative to downgrade my room but I could not move back to my Strip view for the rest of my 6 day stay if I did this.    I ended up speaking with two checkin attendants. Neither apologized or we’re sympathetic to how frustrating this result was for me. Instead they just said they have no control over house keeping so couldn’t give me an estimate or even special request given my circumstance. It’s now 1pm as I write this review and have again check back at reception.    Funny thing is that I am here for an event industry conference where the Mandalay is showcasing their venue to our event industry. I Certainly don’t expect any special treatment but so far would not be recommending or bragging positively about the Mandalay Bay accommodation check in and front reception at this Special Event Conference.
10,After being struck on head neck back by sn approx 8 ft tall 50 (+/_) falling structure and taken to the hospital there was no follow up (other than a vm asking if i wanted an ice pack which i already purchased several) by anyone at the hotel. Very disappointed.
40,We came back to Mandalay Bay because when stayed there few years ago. We picked it because of the fact that the UFC was having an event at their event center. We were able to use the adult pool but this time we were told that we couldnt use it.
50,Had a awesome time here excellent sleigh slept comfortable staff was really awesome will come again love this place thank you guys It shows here were awesome as well and will come again and bring family and friends
10,Dated hotel keys rarely worked on elevators staff was not very friendly. Food I had was sub par and very tight slots. Overall not a good experience better places to stay.    If you do go prepare to pay 5.50 for a soda and it’s in the smallest glass ever. Haha
50,The Mandalay Bay was a great resort awesome staff great spacious clean modern room & over all I was very pleased with my stay. It is at the end of the strip which makes it a lot more quiet close to the airport and a lot cleaner and no street hustlers!! I would highly recommend staying there. I have stayed at a lot of the other resorts (Luxor Paris NY/NY Caesars Palace etc) and honestly this was the best stay I have had when comparing staff room food serenity.
10,Just checked into a 4 night stay and immediately tried to upgrade ourselves to anything to get out if this room. Very dim lighting throughout. With the curtains open in full sunlight it’s still manages to be not optimal. Disappointed as I know dressing up this evening will be a challenge with this lighting. Advised all rooms have the dim lighting due to their use of certain LED lighting.
10,I would actually really disappointed with my stay at the Mandalay Bay. We had difficulty from the moment we arrived with staff being an educated and not knowing where to direct people. The king Room had a bed as hard as marble. The sheets had a werid smell to them. M life gave us so many different stories and misinformation they had us running in circles. Ultimately we left incredibly disappointed with our stay. It was quite sad we've stayed there several other times in not had any issues but this time there was nothing but issues. I will definitely be reconsidering my next stay in Vegas.
50,Mandalay Bay is a wonderful property with very professional well-trained and helpful staff. Beginning with getting out of the taxi at the beginning of the trip to exiting on the last day the staff is ready and available to assist in any way. I will return!
20,There were many different reasons we had a poor experience: First I paid for an upgrade where as my travel partners were offered the same upgrade to a strip view for free just by accepting two queens? I would have done that. I was never offered it. The pipes in our bathroom kept tapping like a woodpecker all night until finally on the 3rd night I called and complained at 4 am. My husband got food poisoning for 3 solid days on the second night of our trip from the House of Blues restaurant. Almost to the point we had to go to an emergency room. The breakfast that cost $57 was 4 very stale and small pastries that were hard as a rock.
50,The purpose of visit was attending a conference in Vegas but we extend our stay for leisure and shopping. It’s a huge property with large conference facilities the service was good and we enjoyed our stay.
50,The service was exceptional from the time we checked in until the moment we checked out. Our room was immaculate so was the rest of the property. If your looking for a great place to stay with tons of activities look no further you found it. Love the Mandalay would recommend to everyone who asked!! Thanks Mandalay for a great stay see you all when we return.
40,Was a great stay. Very helpful staff and friendly loved the restaurants and the Santana show was great!! Very easy to get around in such a big hotel. The grounds were very well kept and loved walking the whole property
40,What a change.    Love the connectivity to the Delano.    The casino has many great games and the stakes are not high compared to the new addition.    They have Texas Hold Tournaments at various times.    Great staff.    The have the Michael Jackson Circ show here.  Will catch it next week.    They also had a photographers convention which closed the bar. But still plenty of options.
50,Stayed here to attend a conference that was held on site. Loved the hotel. It was a pleasure. The room was very nice and clean. We had plenty of options to choose from for food and entertainment. You really did not need to leave the premises unless you wanted to hit the strip.
50,Everything is 5 star including all the casino staff house keeping valet m-life counter VIP service. Mandalay bay sets the bar extremely high. Me and my friends will definitely be back for our next adventure
50,Super cleanfriendly staff and delicious churrosat Bay Buffet on a Tuesday dinnerloland killer baby back pork ribs  Only bad point the first week of March only one bathroom and no changing roomawful lines just to pee you have to have at least 2 bathroom since you have 2 pool openMusic way too loudvery clean and friendly staff except one employee at the spa and Do Not Dine late at Citizen restaurant awful and overprice food .
40,The hotel and casino are well laid out and easy to navigate. The rooms are large clean and nicely decorated with no sign of wear. The conference space was easy to navigate. The restaurants were expensive for the very average quality of food. Azure served steaks that we some of the worst ever eaten for a restaurant at that price point.
50,I stayed at the Mandalay Bay for the WPPI photographers convention and I have to tell you I was very happy. The check-in was easy the room I had was perfect I could not have been any happier. We utilize the motorized carts which made the trip even better.
20,I was given a room with shower very dirty and handle almost falling off. There were chocolate stains on my pillows as soon as arriving. Bath tub was stained and gunk in it. You can see how dirty it was right away. Also towels were dirty.
50,Mandalay Bay is a gorgeous facility. My overall opinion is definitely influenced by the fact that we had a suite so it was a huge room with luxurious bathroom as well as a full sitting area with couch marble coffee tables and side chairs. There was a full desk and a dresser with nine large drawers two closets large nightstands....a great room with a huge sweeping window and view. The hotel and casino are immaculate and there is a wide assortment of shops and restaurants. I found it less confusing than others in terms of finding your way around. We enjoyed several restaurants - Hussong’s Cantina (try the Margarita flight!) Citizen’s for coffee and pastries and Ri Ra an Irish pub. There’s a free tram that will take you down the strip a ways if you don’t want to walk. The shower was wonderful. No complaints at all!
50,I travel to Vegas a few times a year. I always choose a different hotel to stay at. This was my first visit to Mandalay and it will definitely not be the last. Great staff! Hotel was palatial! Dont even get me started on the pool...
40,Here for convention stayed for first time and would stay again.Like restruants on site casino OK while place smells like coconuts. It was too cold to use the pool but looked impressive. Highly recommend Border Grill!!
20,Room was clean but the furniture is getting old. The carpets feel really old.  The $30 a day F&B credit is only good for the buffet which is terrible or the extremely overpriced restaurants that most of the week closed early because they are so quite. The restaurants you want to use and serve great food are not included. I only discovered this on check out $150.00 out of pocket.  Gambling food and shopping are much better of strip. After 22 years of staying on the strip I’m going to try something off  strip next time.  MGM seems to be on a relentless mission to nickel and dime every guest. Vegas and particularly the strip has lost its magic. Fact is because of that I spend less now than I did 10 years ago.  Less bean counting more customers focus required.
50,Mandalay Bay is an excellent choice when staying in Las Vegas. Clean friendly staff and excellent food and services. Beautiful rooms and excellent accommodations. The hotel is well located on the Las Vegas strip and great taxi and uber access.
50,love it just amazing very nice organized clean amazing beds and shower just perfect the whole room was just amazing the window view was amazing and u have everything u need to feel amazing i loved it i will be there again soon
40,"High resort fees especially when the pools are closed. Not much help around if you cant find what you are looking for.    We really liked House of Blues.    The tram is nice. It would be great if they tied it to the others.    Michael Jackson show was good if you ignore ""Neverland"" and the images of children in it including one who said he was molested."
10,We just spent two nights here. Upon checkin we were told we could upgrade to a King bedroom. Well there was no reason to up grade because that is what we reserved???? They wanted $20 more a night for something we already paid for.    Will not be back. Normally we stay at the Venetian and have always booked through SW vacations they have never given us an issue til now.    Also resort fees for pools that are not even open????? NO.
50,Very clean and comfortable friendly staff and lots of Resturant to enjoy. My wife and I traveled to Vegas for the first time and we were extremely happy that we choose to stay at the Mandalay Bay Resort.
40,I've stayed here before and wanted to stay at least one more time before the football stadium opens up. The check in staff is great. I am an MLife member and was comped a room. I was there for the Blake Shelton concert for the MLife group. I was able to check in early with no issue. My room was fine and the bed great. They provide both feather and non feather pillows. I was there as a solo and it might seem a strange complaint but I don't like the bathroom toilet set up. It is in a small closet room that the door automatically closes on. I wish I had remembered that as I could have brought a door stop to keep it open! The bathroom does have 2 sinks and a separate tub and shower. That is quite nice. I was kind of able to prop the toilet room door open with a garbage can with the hair dryer in it to weight it down so it wouldn't slam shut. I also found someone's clothes in the drawers upon check in. The tram to get you to Excalibur does not start operating until 9am. So I walked the full way to Aria buffet breakfast one morning. I did enjoy my stay there and found all staff to be helpful and friendly.
30,So ridiculous to pay for a expensive room and then get charged for chairs by the pool. Las Vegas greed as become too much. So many other fun options else where that are less expensive. I think it’s time for Vegas casino to go through a downturn.
50,I first started our vacation at Planet Hollywood. Things went bad there so we checked out and Mandalay Bay graciously took us in at last minute to finish our vacation. Saving the vacation for us. Beautiful hotel! Wonderful staff! Thanks for a great vacation!
50,Excellent stay at the Mandalay bay  thought it was out of the way but worked out perfect as it was easy to get in and out casino Not too big but everything you need tight there Only complaint is $ 12.00 for a cup of coffee in your room is a little much
30,The front desk didn’t give information about the place. Didn’t ask me why I came it was basic 2 start hotel. I had issues. Refrigerator sensors didn’t know about it . Security at the club didn’t let me charge my iphone and. Bartender take to long to get drinks.
30,I loved the hotel I just didn’t like how the rooms where clean need better cleaning service. There was hairs in the tub and shower. I didn’t use the tub but when I use the shower I had to clean it myself
10,At check-in was told we were getting a king size bed I am 63 275 pounds we got two queen size bed our view was of a roof went down to talk to attendant at front desk she said that’s all we have you can always go stay at another hotel rooms were very clean they do a great job of cleaning your room every day at checkout was told I would not receive the $30 voucher because we did not eat at hotels on the list we never received the list at check-in asked to speak to the manager was told the manager was too busy that was two different occasions never got to speak to a manager the managers are not there to help the customers they have a wet bar the prices in the wet bar The prices in the wet bar are not there for the customers they are inflated 1000% overall I would not stay at that hotel the Mandalay Bay for free like I said the food was good the rooms were clean but the customer service you received at the front desk when you check-in and when you leave is very poor
50,Great hotel everything was awesome ! Amenities great casino was awesome excellent location. Beach pool was awesome .hotel was very clean. The bayside buffet was not all that only thing good there was the snow crab legs
50,Great hotel nice and clean. Teller was great helped me check in and make arrangements for my stay due to change of plans. Great overall normally people wouldn't help unless you ask but the fact that it made it easier thank you thank you
40,Everything was good in my opinion restaurants staff check in etc. and I would definitely go back here. This trip was business for a trade show however I would go back on my own for pleasure. Good location for me.
50,The rooms are clean and the staff is very helpfull. The restaurants are fantastic as well as the buffet. Great pool for the kids and nice adlut area also. It's got a great view of the stirp and the cost to get that view is worth it.
50,We have stayed here several times every time we rarely leave. So many restaurants and things to do right in the resort. The pool is amazing (although we didn't get in this trip our kids loved it our last trip). One of my favorite things is the service in the casino area never had to wait long for a drink when we were gambling. The waitress' were so kind and even remembered our drinks from the days before.
40,1st time in Vegas. We t for a conference / Seminar. Place is huge. Wear very comfortable walking shoes if going to conference area in hotel as it's almost a mile walk each way. The rooms were clean and the beds are very comfortable. Drinks are very expensive as I'm sure you find that everywhere in Vegas
20,Mandalay Bay lost a good chance to redeem themselves after 3 nights of poor cleanliness if the room...after we did our checkout they simply said you needed to come before the checkout...I cannot credit of refund anything...what a bunch of bull
50,Great rooms very clean and well kept. I love the atmosphere and would stay here again in a heartbeat! The buffet is a great option if you don't want to wait in line at one of the other restaurants and the food is good quality.
10,The lights did not work in my room the entire stay and after multiple attempts going down to the front desk to get the problem fixed nothing was resolved. I stayed for 4 days in the dark. I had to use the restroom brush my teeth shave and shower all in complete darkness
50,The hotel is very clean and very well maintained. It is located with easy access to the airport. Actually you can see the property from the airport terminal. The mattresses are phenomenal. The Michael Jackson One show at Mandalay Bay is a must see.
50,Excellent stay. No issues. Easy check-in. Room clean and comfortable. Food options good and food tasty. Convention center facilities were very good even though it was a long walk... it was good exercise. I did not use casino so cannot comment on that.
30,First let me say that a very nice lady at the M life desk Nancy was amazing and helped me out so much. I couldn’t have asked for a better customer service. She deserves 10 stars!    This is my second time to Las Vegas and I had two nights comped through the myVEGAS app. The room itself was nice but was constantly hot. They sent someone to fix the thermostat but it was not working. Nothing is free in the room including coffee. Would not recommend the buffet - stick to the Restaurants. I didn’t realize how far away it was from pretty much everything so the daily journeys we exhausting. Overall this was a below average stay for me.    Enjoyed the Libertine and live music by Phil Stendeck at the House of Blues. Slice of Vegas pizza at the shoppes was great and definitely have a drink from Fat Tuesday’s! The Michael Jackson One show was pretty cool and sushi restaurant was ok but have had better.    I would give a poor rating but Nancy at mlife and the entertainment bring it up. That is why it’s an average for me. Again this rating is up because of the customer service and entertainment! If you stay here just be aware of the cons but check out the casino and restaurants above!
10,From check in I was charged a night that I wasn't there and had cancelled 72 hrs in advance then was given a key card to a stranger's room and walked in on them finally got my correct room and the toilet ran all night second night security and paramedics bang and woke me up just to say they had the wrong room escalator didn't work one of the Tran rails was down also just a mess and I use to love Mandalay I'm a Mlife credit card holder service has gotten very poor and all they think about is how to charge you for everything not quality service I've decided to go back North of the strip to Palazzo...
50,The staff is amazing even though the hotel is at the end of the strip it is easy to get to other properties. the rooms are clean its a comfortable hotel. easy to find your way around and has nice pools for family and for adults.
10,I've been to Vegas nine times now and I would have to say that this was the worst hotel/casino experience I have had while being out there. I stayed at the Cosmopolitan a few nights beforehand which was very nice and booked a room at the Mandalay Bay for a real estate conference I was attending at the resort. The overrall experience was just not good and going forward if I attend this conference I will definitely be staying at another hotel/resort. Room service was 1.5 hours anytime you used the phone for a service it took a minumum of 5 minutes for someone to pick up after you have had to listen to the same ads over and over again. I believe there is much room for improvement in every aspect of service at this hotel.
50,My friends and I visited for a conference and for pleasure - we had a great stay. Checkin was quick and easy rooms were really nice and clean. Staff was great. Distance from room to conference was not far (maybe 5 minute walk). Restaurants and food were great especially BBQ Mexicana for something fast and good!
50,We had a great stay. We will be coming back soon. Rooms were wonderful pool was exceptional and even has a lazy river. I love how the hotel is off the side of the casio. We ate at several of the property resturants but our favorite was the Bayside Buffet.
50,Great place for a business convention and great place to stay as well. Great atmosphere and excellent food choices. Many great options to fit any need really. I would recommend for anyone whether it’s business or leisure Mandalay Bay works for anything.
50,Nice resort. Good food. Careful of the rooms they charge for even using the fridge to store personal items. Great views the casino is very nice. Growth Con was amazing. I think Mandalay Bay owes Grant Cardone a big thank you for even considering using their hotel.
30,Nice hotel but just as the title says my room came with someone's panties. I noticed that the bathroom floor had dried flowers all over but the vanity and toilet room looked clean. The shower I questioned as it had no toiletries so I cleaned it myself. To my surprise when I closed the bathroom door I found a pair of blue panties hanging on the door handle. Ewww. What does such a thing get you at Mandalay Bay...the $40 resort fees removed...Meh. Good thing this was a last minute one night stay for a friends birthday.  Aside from that little nasty bit the room was quiet bed was comfy mini stocked well.
50,It was mainly a business trip with a little of pleasure. I had a great time. It was awesome. The staff was great and very helpful. I was there for the Growth Conference and it was AMAZING!! I will be there again next year!
50,Hotel staff and amenities by far exceeded my expectations. We most enjoyed Bayside buffet. I visited for a 5 day conference and some R&R. We had a medical emergency during our stay and the staff immediately call emergency services and they arrived in minutes. We can’t thank Mandaly enough for their quick action.
30,One small bottle of water from mini-bar cost $18.00!!! No prices at mini-bar to warn you. Coffee-maker in room also at mini-bar prices per cup. Can't use refrigerator it is full of more mini-bar junk!
50,Had an absolutely amazing time there at shark reef. It was amazing to see all the animals and fishes. Must say it was spectacular adventure for me and my family. I would recommend to everyone to check it out
50,Has a great time at the Mandalay resort so many choice for food and excellent shopping. Rooms were very clean and good bed for sleeping. In casino drinks were served in a timely fashion with a pleasant smile. Was very happy to have had experience staying there.
50,Beautiful rooms clean hotel and wonderful staff. Oh! And the different styles of restaurants seemed to be endless no matter the your budget. Simply interested in a quick bit to take to your room? How about stopping by the market? Want a more upscale dining experience? There are many to choose from.
50,I have nothing critical to say regarding my stay at Mandalay. Service is always excellent rooms comfortable. I play poker and have noticed the room gets less players than a few years back. I would suggest going back to progressive high hands as you did before to increase players.
50,It is amazing hotel amazing services great food and great restaurants options and food.  A beautiful hotel.  The location was great the view incredible. The rooms are clean the stuff are at service and it was incredible experience!
50,Mandalay is one of my favorite spots to come for work. Quick ride in from the airport nicely upgraded property that’s got options but not so much it takes a month to walk to the convention area and of course a solid room experience for the night.    Business traveler view here and all but it really is one of the nicer rooms without a crazy cost. Lots of space actually sane number of outlets and in decent locations. Comfy bed shower tall enough for someone not short ok views. Walls could use another dose of soundproofing for people tramping around at 2am but such is Vegas.    While it’s far down the strip the connector to Luxor and then up to other spots allows for enough options and wandering up to more exciting venues further along the strip.    Outside options aren’t the best right around the hotel but it is a very quick walk to a gas station for more reasonable snacks or a quick drive to escape the madness and get off the strip.
40,The most gorgeous rooms. Place feels understaffed. Wait times for all food is too long. Staff is friendly. Ask for a room close to the elevator because after walking forever to get to your floor the hallways are extremely long.
40,We stayed here on a weekday February- 3 night getaway. Figured it may not be too busy. Aside from a convention or two it was not mobbed. Elegant place! Our room was Resort King roomy enough for two. Did not get the upgraded room with a view for $35/night extra. Had a great view of the airport but really who stays in their room looking out the window in LV? Room was clean bed and bedding top-notch bathroom roomy and clean 2 sinks. Lots of connections for charging things. Good lighting. It was quiet but I noticed that the walls are a little thin if you have a loud talker in the next room-we heard a Mom talking to every one of her kids in great detail one morning-nothing wrong with that. One thing I didn't like was the minibar and the conditions that come with that- almost like they are looking to trip you up and charge you money for touching or moving anything in the mini bar. Oh man don't put your own bottle of water in there! Thats a fine. We stayed away from that whole thing-didn't even open it. Of course there is a Resort charge. This is not new not a surprise. I am amazed at reading other reviews where people are shocked-Shocked!-when they see this on their bills. I don't like it either but we payed it anyway because we love to go to LV. So many eating options here I am not going to try to review that. You will find what you like. We had no issues with service or staff. We did cell phone check in very easy. Sure the location is at the far south end of the Strip. Some may not like being in the center of things but we like it-been coming here for 30 years don't need the freak show that the central Strip has become. Good free live music at night in the casino. Parking garage is a hike from Registration and elevators but thats minor.If you have M Life Pearl or above no charge for parking. If you are a Vet you will get free parking. I don't review casinos if they are loose or tight. It is a lovely casino! Have fun at MB!
40,I was on business trip we have been going there every year for last several years. overall quality and value is great. This year overall experience was better than before. Seems like management is making a more concentrated effort to improve overall quality of guests experience.
30,We needed to get out of Washington and into the sun. It was a trip with my girlfriends to enjoy good food clubs the pool and a little gambling. We spent most of the time in our hotel. The food at Lupo was amazing.
20,Problem checking in and problem checking out. On daily basis there were debits out of my account which seemed odd. As I write this review the matter is not resolved. I have never dealt with this type of inefficiency. Honestly if I could help it I will never stay at Mandalay Bay if I could help it. There were12000 people from my group in that conference.
30,We stay here every year for a conference and enjoy the casino and variety of restaurants. The rooms however are getting a bit worn. The towels are terrible hot water was very limited and the TV didn't work. The fact that they take up a good portion of your counter and drawer space with an electronically monitored fridge and minbar that charges you if you even touch it is ridiculous! On the plus side we had a great strip view and the beds were comfy!    As others have mentioned you will pay a $39 resort fee even when pools are closed. This too is ridiculous as you get nothing else for this fee.    We did enjoy several of the restaurants esp. Libertine Social and Hazel. The live music at Hazel is fantastic--just wish they were open later.    And as for the gaming: while playing electronic group roulette we hit a number and our machine immediately went black. Ours was the only machine that did this. We tried to find assistance but there was no one around. My husband found a waitress and she had no idea what to do and was no help. A security guy was also unable to help. Neither he nor the waitress would call anyone for us. I stayed with our machine with the black screen while my husband was searching. After about 8 mins it came back on but did not record our win so we did not receive our winnings. We just gave up and left. Huge bummer.    This hotel is a solid three star hotel but calling it a four star is really a stretch. Now that our conference has moved hotels we won't be coming back.
10,I was really disappointed. The TV did not work due to lost signal. I tried ordering room service and they did not have the 12 oz. steak that I wanted.    I could not watch any TV while waiting for my departure.    The convenience was not there.
50,Close to the airport the first Resort on the Strip and offers a variety of excitement relaxation and fun. The Spa saunas are amazing and I even took a nap after on the lounge chairs until my room was ready.
20,- 1.) Be Warm 2.) Read Your Customer and 3.) Give Options with Grace & Humility  If the room the guest paid for is not available when the person checks in I think staff should be genuine and thoughtful with the options they provide to their customers next. For instance if a guest can't check in right away why not offer a food voucher while they wait or a free drink? I understand some people are in a hurry after traveling to just get in a room but others would actually like to know what their options. Although it may be hard to tell the difference that's a part of good customer service. Knowing how to read/anticipate your guest. To be a high class resort I was expecting more class and better communication than I received.
50,I only booked this hotel because of a discount from their M plus rewards through MGM and the 10X Growth conference with Grant Cardone was happening at the Mandalay Bay Convention center. I was not happy to have to wait 4 days on my last day to have a King bedroom had queen but paid king room price. The wait for over an hour for a remote control was so annoying I was cheesed I olmost missed seeing Kevin Hart speak. Overall better hotel but farther down on the strip. Never left my hotel to walk outside which I love to do for pics and food. Food is expensive there. You pay top dollar there but the service should have been better.
50,This place is beautiful in its architecture fountains waterfalls swimming pools and especially its staff. Everyone I dealt with was warm friendly and very helpful. The Guest room was beautifully appointed and had marble floors shower and a huge tub. My room overlooked the strip and faced east. I was able to capture some inspiring sunrise photos.
10,they do everything they can to trap you with hidden fees. if you eat a bag of chips from your room they charge $70. And they make it seem like it's a gift for staying with them. don't have prices anywhere
30,The hotel is nice but order a cup of coffee and pay $6.00 order a beer and your at $10.00 during our conference I purchased a small protein bar for $7.00. The rooms are nice the staff is good but not enough cocktail waitresses or at least they don't come around very often. I haven't been to Vegan in the last 2 years but I do not remember it being so expensive for a simple cup of coffee!
10,To charge your guests for refreshment charges which cost more than the room itself. Drinks which were never touched nor did we want anything to do with those drinks is absolutely unethical and a scam. Completely disappointing to come home to these charges after a business trip. Will never recommend or step foot in this place again
50,The Mandalay Bay is a wonderful establishment to reside with while visiting the area. I will definitely recommend this resort & look forward to future business with this resort. I greatly appreciated the friendliness of the staff.
30,Nice property. Convention center is huge so plan on walking a lot (which can be good). Property smells of cigarettes as you have to go through the casino to get anyplace. OK restaurants all (even food court) as pricey. Even with pool closed still paying the full resort fee.
30,Paid for an suite which had multiple service issues that took hours to get resolved. Long wait times for service including room service. Overall stay was ok but service could’ve been much better in regards to maintenance of rooms.
20,Rooms were average location was far from most things on strip. Service was ok to poor. Had hotel employee try to enter room without permission while taking nap. Sinks in bathroom were left full with cleaning fluid everyday but one. At least the rooms were quiet and the beds were comfortable.
40,Mandalay Bay was a nice hotel. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The aquarium was awesome make sure that you go and see it. Skip the Buffet it was really disappointing. When checking in they didnt have a king room which we booked 6 months in advance. They gave us a room with two queens instead of a complimentary upgrade. Overall the hotel is nice and we enjoyed our stay.
40,The place was clean the house keeping was awesome (ana) The shop was too expensive i bought water and drinks out sidee of the casino which was cheaper and dislike that there is no transportation to and from the airport
10,Luxury is defined by many people differently. Some will look at the decor others at how well they were treated The conveniences that were available as well as the inconveniences that were avoided. I think it’s probably a combination of many things but if I am of the opinion that I would go back to a hotel or any including restaurant I would definitely consider that facility to have something that encompasses luxury be it a smile comfort great food. Behold the $12.00 luxurious cup of coffee pictured below I suspect not from the civet cat.    The same cannot be said of the Mandalay. Like everything else in Las Vegas it’s primarily the ILLUSION of luxury that seduces the traveler as you are pushed through the registration and then finding out that self-park is two blocks away that if your bottle of water is cooled in their refrigerator is an extra $50 that your room does NOT have coffee maker so you should luxuriously make your way down at 6:00AM to the luxurious long line awaiting coffee in the Starbucks or the HAZEL coffee shop. LUXURY MEANS TO STAY IN YOUR ROOM AS LONG AS YOU WANT BECAUSE YOU ARE IN WANT OF NOTHING. Luxury is not having to stay in a hotel that is threatening you with a $50 charge if you move their refrigerator contents or that has a parking lot 2 blocks away or one that surreptitiously charges you for a resort that you never use. This last point is actually the fault of TRIP ADVISOR who has failed its users by avoiding mention of this scam. Just remember that these hotels and casinos were originally brought to you by the anti-socials of the mafia. Who now runs them is anybody’s guess Harvey Weinstein’s pals?💩💩💩💩
50,My husband and I stayed here on a business trip from Thurs - Sunday. It was our first time at this hotel and they didn’t disappoint. Clean beautiful and comfortable rooms a friendly staff delicious restaurants and overall just a beautiful hotel. Definitely recommend!
40,Room was very nice and clean. It was easy to check-in and check-out with no waiting. The convention center was an easy walk though it got very crowded. The restaurants were nice and usually busy; however the food and drinks were WAY overpriced compared to the quality of the food and service.
20,Don’t waste your time or money on this place.. The casino has got you hooked here... Very expensive and service is very slow and unhappy servers. could go on and on but not worth it. Walk a little and save your money.
20,Again SCVA put on another well organized volleyball tournament. Even if our LAC 17USA girls didn’t receive a medal winning their division keeping 107 courts 214 teams playing simultaneously is quite a feat!  Mandalay Bay should reconsider their business plan. Instead of charging teenaged girls $6.25 for one bottle of Gatorade and making everyone stand in long food lines try bringing in more vendors and focus on selling quantity instead of draining a child’s spending money to rehydrate!  These young ladies are athletes and should be treated as such! Parents are not allowed to bring in our own food or drinks yet the venue falls way to short in accommodating these athletes the necessary energy and nutrition they require in the short periods between matches.
50,Very clean and comfortable room.Secruity is great for going to your hotel room. Convention hall area is huge and little intimidating but marked very well. Convention rooms are easy to here in as the speaker are talking.
20,Poor service at Hazel lounge poor quality in room dining forgot an expensive item in the room after checkout and it was not in lost and found the next day. No coffee or usable fridge in room. Poorly maintained cardio gym and other gyms in the hotel cost $30 per day! Fees on all services keep going up.
40,Good service at reception good access to food and stores  good security whit privacy comfortable rooms  good access for transportation like Uber taxis and the tramp in between the tree casinos but high price on parking lot
50,Firstly the casino is extremely well kept. In addition the professionalism and friendliness of the staff and willingness to help and assist with any issue at the drop of a hat has made this trip extremely enjoyable and I look forward to my next visit. Additionally I would like to personally thank Jimmy Barilla and Enne Bond for going above and beyond what is typically expected of casino staff. Both are the examples that all staff should attempt to emulate. It was a pleasure.
30,Usually we have top A service but this time we could not reach the front desk for 3 days in a row just went to a recording The thermosat was stuck so it was very got in room and TV had no communication service it was not until 3rd day it finally worked. I hate giving a poor rating especially since in past this has been our go to hotel.
40,I liked all the amenities inside of the resort. All the different restaurants offered a lot of variety. The shark reef aquarium was great and the pool area is very nice. The casino is very nice as well.
50,During check in the clerk talked so fast that I couldn't understand him. I asked for him to repeat and he repeated back just as fast. Got to the room had to call for an extra towel. Person who brought it up also spoke low and fast.    Room was very nice. My wife fell in love with the soaking tub. It is rare to find a hotel in Vegas with a tub let alone a big soaking tub.    The beds were very comfortable maid service was top notch.    Check out was pleasant I noticed they tax the rooms and resort fees separately. The resort fee is a lower tax so I didnt complain. Wouldn't do any good anyway.    Over all a pleasant stay.
30,Stayed here for a large conference that took place at the convention center. I enjoyed my room and the very nice bathroom. Good view of the strip. It was nice to be in the same hotel as the conference but it was a LONG walk to the convention center. The walls are paper thin so I heard the people in the room next to me (just normal conversation decibel snoring etc). Bring ear plugs to sleep for this reason and also if you are staying on the side of the hotel across the street from the airport. The food is my biggest complaint. This hotel does not have near the diversity or quality of eatery options as other hotels on the Strip. It's also quite expensive so hard to justify since quality is subpar. Since I was there for a conference I had no choice but to buy all my meals at this hotel. You could leave the hotel and go to McDonalds but with the location of this hotel at the end of the Strip there is not much else around you. The casino seemed to prohibit the conference host from providing us with reasonably priced food options. For this reason I will likely not return to this conference which is always hosted each year at this hotel.
20,Water infiltration/damage evident in several places in the room. Bathroom door did not close properly making a lot of noise. French doors to bathroom uneven so that when they were closed one could still see inside bathroom area. Overall very disappointed with the room. Would not return nor recommend this hotel
50,"First trip to Vegas and the Mandalay Bay was an excellent choice for us. Everything was great. MB is at the ""end"" of the strip so bring your walking shoes but the tram gets you as far as the Excalibur and then it is about a mile walk down to what I would call the ""center"" of the strip. However you could have an excellent Vegas vacation and never leave the MB grounds they had everything you could want."
50,We have been coming to Mandalay Bay frequently for the past three years and find it to be one of the best hotel-casinos on the Strip and all of Vegas. Cleanliness and quality abound throughout the Hotel and we have always enjoyed our stays there. Rooms are clean and spacious. Access to the Hotel from the parking garage is of prime importance to us since we now live in Southern Utah and are able to drive into Vegas for our stays. Access from the garage to the Casino floor is a piece of cake and very accommodating to reach the front deck and room elevators as well as the casino floors. We love Mandalay Bay and put it at the top of our list.
10,We had to ask twice to have our room cleaned. My daughter and I were there for volleyball. After a long day we would come back to a dirty room. We asked housekeeping at about 4 each day. They said they normally don’t clean rooms each day. Had to ask for clean towels. We ended up making our own beds! Glad we paid almost 300 dollars a night. Unfortunately we are back next month for volleyball. The worker had to come fix our sink that didn’t drain. He left a horrible mess. A housekeeper knocked on our door a few hours later to clean this up but I had already done my best. Horrible!!
20,You have to pay to use Fitness and sauna. I think this should be included in the perks for being at the hotel. The water being $18 dollars in the room is very high as well. The wait at restaurants was very long over an hour in line for Starbucks.    They had 2 conferences at the same time and I was stuck in a hallway for 15 minutes being pushed.
50,This is a beautiful resort that offers everything you would want in Las Vegas. A nice casino good restaurants efficient valet very nice rooms and bathrooms and good service. The location is not as convenient as some others but there is a tram that helps.
10,Counted at least 4 different peoples hair on our bedding and in our tub. Grind on the walls. Unwashed dishware. Dozens of pictures of all this! Disgusting. I had to hunt down managers to get anyone to do anything. And even still the response was totally lacking. They acted as if this is the norm and I should just get over it sand pay for it. Really unbelievable.
10,"You make enough money on the casino the ""resort fee"" for what I get from that seems to be a complete zero and it is a huge daily fee.  One single banana at your simple shop is $3. Usually pay less than $50 cents. I can afford what you charge but you really do not need to rape your guests Now you charge for self parking an appetizer is more than a typical entree most restaurants. I am done with your hotel after coming for over 10 years. Enough is enough. there are 5 small hotels within a 15 minute walk that charge fair fees for their rooms and food. MY VETERINARY CONFERENCE IS THERE BUT NOT MYSELF IN THE FUTURE."
50,We stayed at Mandalay Bay for the annual Western States Veterinary Conference which I had not attended in years probably since the organization first started using this venue. I remembered it being a very nice hotel and my memories did not disappoint me! It was possible (I did this so I know) to stay completely indoors for over 24 hours since the meeting was in the convention hall and anything we would want to eat or do could be obtained right there. It is a little pricy but I would certainly hope to return to attend this conference at this venue again in future.
10,The bathroom in the room on arrival was not cleaned and smelled of a urinal the toilet seat was sticky they had a housekeeper come back and it did not resolve the issue. The thermostat did not work I was freezing used both blankets on one bed. The room service sent up cold pancakes and coffee in leaky cups no napkins for $50. The housekeeping man came into the room at 8am while I was in my pjs (I am a woman alone) and looked at me while I repeatedly said no no no I am checking out at 11 GET OUT OF MY ROOM. I stayed here 4 nights - they did not comp one night. It was horrible to smell urine for a day and a half they gave me a $75 food credit and resort fee credit. Oh Yay! $300 a night. Go somewhere else. Each time I called they took my call as if I were a pain in their a** not a paying customer with a legitimate problem. I travel often and in my last 6 business/personal trips have not had one issue - this was the worst place I have stayed.
40,"Great location FANTASTIC FACILITY Great food (hotel catered ours for business meetings) really amazing setting. Room wasn't outdated but wasn't ""pristine"" hence the 4/5. Was clean but more picked up than truly clean--I'd expect better and typically experience better from similarly type hotels. It was picked up but not truly clean...and I'd expect truly clean out of even lower star rated hotels. I give them a 4/5 because I think I got an ok room and suspect it an outlier. It wasn't dirty to the point of me needing to complain just wasn't ""fresh"" if that makes sense."
50,My husband found the conference facilities to be excellent. Together we so enjoyed the many restaurants at lunch and in the evenings. The casino was active and the many stores were great for browsing and shopping. Our room was spacious and clean.  The perfect balance in a resort property!
30,I stayed at this hotel because I was attending a convention that was happing at the hotel. I have asthma and I knew there would be a casino and people would be smoking. I came prepared with a mask and stayed out of the casino whenever possible (only walked through). What I was not expecting was the fact that there was so much smoke (cigarettes and joints) that I was still inhaling smoke you at the shops. They need to invest in an air purifier for their hotel.
20,Only stayed at the hotel because my daughter was playing at a tournament in the convention center. Not only did the casino smell of the usual decrepit smoke but some mitigation measure make the odor even more unbearable. I do not want to see this hotel again nor do I want to visit Las Vegas again. What a horrible cesspool.
20,The room is nice but we stayed three nights and never got the room serviced which is strange because we were gone most of the days. Even after I specifically called and scheduled a time for the cleaning services to come they never showed up. Ironically they did clean on the morning of the day we were leaving which didn't do us much good at that point. They advertise having a fridge but you can't use it unless you want to pay an extra $35 a day ridiculous! Also no free coffee service in the room have to pay and you can only find the prices by finding the list on the TV. Waiting staff at the restaurants seemed generally unhappy and unavailable though other hotel staff seemed nice.
40,The rooms are definitely beautiful and very clean. The bed and pillows were quite comfortable. There was even a one cup coffee machine I was able to use. I would recommend bringing your own coffee cup and additives because you will be charged for using the hotels. Also storing personal items in the refrigerator will incur a $50 fee so be aware. If you’re trying to save money while traveling none refrigerated snacks are a must. The restaurants are very expensive as well here. I used eating establishments elsewhere.
50,From check in to check out it was great. Ate at Libertine Social which is always exceptional! Love the menu from appetizers to dessert great selections. Branzino is great! Presentation as well as flavor. Love to set at chefs counter and watch them cook. Sommelier is very nice and helpful. Staff is right on point! Drinks and appetizers in the bar are a must do if you aren’t up for dinner.
20,Pros: central location room was clean    Cons: try to upcharge you for literally everything. They even plastic wrapped coffee cups and pods and are trying to charge for coffee in the room! Ha! A bud light in the bar is minimum $9. For these prices skip Vegas altogether and go to an all inclusive in the Caribbean.    Overall it was a let down. Vegas is dying - the newer generations aren’t willing to overpay for a cheesy and mediocre experience.
10,Horribly overpriced with free nothing. Many hidden costs. The room located on the seventh floor looked out through grate like widows.The dinner buffet was over priced and the food was terrible. They were even able to ruin pizza.
30,"Room was nice with deep tub and clean. Bed was very comfortable. No complimentary coffee had to pay $12 for ""Coffee for 2"" WHAT!!! Forget that don't touch the minibar in the room outrageous prices. For the resort fee they could at least give you coffee!  Dinner Buffet food was not good. Tough meat sugar free desserts were mislabled. Go elsewhere! not worth the $36.99 for dinner!"
50,"We always had stayed at Venetian when we go to Vegas (since my aunt is a ""high roller""). This time she did not come with us so I got a room thru Trivago at Mandalay Bay. We had a great time. They know how to take care of their guests. They give you a $30 ""meal credit"" that you can use in most of the MGM properties. Rooms were clean and big. Staff were very helpful. I actually recommended it to my aunt. Hopefully she can get comp rooms here too."
50,Wanting to get my mom the best seats at the best price I went directly to Mandalay Bay for The Michael Jackson One Show. Christopher went above and beyond!!! He stayed past his shift helping me he made sure I had numbers to reach him for additional assistance prior to the show he also made sure my mom had wheelchair assistance. Lastly what blew my mind was that he followed up afterwards to make sure we enjoyed the show and to see if he could assist with anything else!!! Thank you Christopher you are a true rockstar your kindness and attention to detail will never be forgotten bless you for making my mom's 80th Birthday special!!!
50,The pool area is beautiful. The resort area is easy to navigate. There is a nice choice of places to eat. Although it is at one end of the strip-it is easily accessible to the other resorts. The room views are wonderful.
20,Unfortunately no different than many other hotels. Numerous additional charges and fees parking $50/day to use the refrigerator resort fee etc. We ate at the House of Blues and the hamburgers were horrible. Better burgers can be found in a vending machine. Service was nothing special and slow. No beers on tap. Will never go back. Live music was mediocre at best.
40,Great resort. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Our two queen bed room was a great size as was the bathroom and shower. Beds were very comfortable. Overall the resort was very clean even with a large convention of people. Only down side was the long lines for coffee (everywhere in the morning due to the large size of the event). This is the second time we have stayed here and it really is a great place to stay.
40,Enjoyed our stay. Friendly at check-in lots of varied eating options and a number of things to do. However one of the things we could not do was go to the pools as they are apparently closed for the winter. We weren’t necessarily planning on swimming (though it was in 70’s two of the days) but then why are we being hit for a $37/night resort fee (in addition to $12/day parking)? Seems tacky and should be included in rate.
50,Spent 4 nights in a fabulous panoramic view suite at Mandalay Bay Feb. 10 - 14 2020!! Loved every minute of the Vegas visit and hospitality at Mandalay Bay!! Room food casio atmosphere all were wonderful!! I will definitely be back for more stays at Mandalay Bay!! Friendly staff too!!
50,I had booked our room at the cosmo and they made a mistake and booked it for the wrong month got to room and they had no rooms... Found rooms at Mandalay bay and I was super impressed with The complete Mandalay Resort.. Very nice i would recomend any body to stay there...
50,It was a nice stay. Wish the fridge wasn’t locked so we could’ve used it to chill some personal items. Everything else was great. The tv kept turning out because of the reception. The WiFi wasn’t great either
50,We were in Vegas on business and we stayed for the week in Mandalay Bar. I have been to Vegas a few times but this was my first staying here. I would defo return.  The check in was easy staff were very friendly rooms were nice clean really nice size two twin beds in my room. Bathroom was nice bath and shower toilet separate room which I liked. Maid was great room was lovely and clean every day!  There is an Uber waiting area there which was quick and easy to find. We checked out early and left our bags there for the day quick and easy system. Check out was easy too no hassle.  Mandalay Bay is at the top of the strip so is a little out of the main actions but we just jumped in Ubers under $10 to get everywhere. So isn't too bad! The casino was great too we had a lot of fun in there.    There is a great bar called 'Hazel' which we spent time in alot drinks were nice staff were quick. Would recommend visiting.
50,This review is specifically to show appreciation for one specific employee. I've dealt with Morena Cipriano on two different occasions in 3 months. She absolutely goes above and beyond expectations when providing customer service. Our M Life tier level did not determine how professional courteous and hospitable she was to me and my husband. She makes it a point to make sure that she is as pleasant to Sapphire members as she is to Gold members. One of the reasons I return to Mandalay Bay despite all the other choices on the Las Vegas strip is because of the amazing customer service experiences we've had there thanks to Morena Cipriano.
50,Craps table worker Trini (sp?). She was my Husband Brother & Son’s favorite craps table hostess whenever they would see her on a table working they headed STRAIGHT for it! She was so fun & helpful her table was always full & she lit it up with her terrific outgoing personality!!  We can’t wait to get back to Mandalay Bay for another very personalized trip! All around BEST hotel we’ve stayed at!! Thanks for the fun!
40,Stay was nice room was clean and comfortable. No good restaurants to eat at after 11:00pm. Casino was attracting.Bell service was prompt. Valet was servicing well. Staff at front desk was very professional. Although I was charged an extra 20.00 for a view not fair!
50,The price was worth it! My girlfriend asked for chocolate covered strawberries for Valentine’s Day and the hotel made it happen! Perfect ending to a perfect evening. Sky Lounge and the Delano restaurant was amazing!
40,Disappointed that they supply a coffee maker but charge $12 for the coffee. If you want to use the fridge they charge a $50 deposit. We wanted to keep water in the fridge but it was locked without and would not open without a deposit. They also charge a $39 (plus tax) resort fee. No clue what that is for.
20,Not happy with stay. First we did not get room we asked for instead got a handicap accessible room. The slots were awful I did not see anyone at the casino winning. Drink lady’s would take forever. The Light club was crowded and loud. The worst was the getting in the parking garage and getting out. Will not staying there anytime soon.
20,It was pretty depressing being there because of what happened with the shooting a couple years ago.    And the pools were closed.    The black jack tables and roulette weren't pay out much. To top it off the minimums were mostly 25 dollar bets.
30,Paid a resort fee when the resort was closed. They need to wave this charge for the off season. Customer service would not give me an explanation. Everything thing else was good. Hotel room was clean food was great
30,Nothing bad but I have stayed at other properties close by for less money that were just as pleasant. I can say that every employee I encountered was really nice. The room was clean. And drinks were strong. Vegas has set a high bar and every one does a great job.
30,We attended a volleyball tournament. Be careful of dynamic room pricing which apparently has no limits. MGM Resorts treats their customer as everything by warning that they charge $$$ if you store anything in the refrigerator (weight monitored) even medications. Prices are at least double or even triple for food. Gouging leaves a sour taste and does not encourage a return visit. We felt “threatened” by management’s warnings and attitude. Employees were very courteous however. But overall we had a less-than-fun experience. Too bad MGM does not care to make the experience more enjoyable.
50,On the last night of our trip to vegas I spent about 6 hours hanging out at a blackjack table with a great dealer. Enne was always more than happy to give some friendly advice. She seemed genuinely happy if i won and genuinely disappointed when i lost. Above all else she was just an enjoyable person to be around.
20,Checked in late for one night. Was going to try out and compare to the other hotels we use (Wynn Bellagio). It was no where near as nice or good. Rooms were basic and ours was a bit dirty. Shower was cheap and our drain cover was unattached. Valet service was not helpful and slow. Food at breakfast was expensive and not good
30,Hotel parking is NOT on the property it’s the equivalent of 2-3 blocks away. I had a suite came with a mini fridge that was loaded with way overpriced drinks (understandable) but if you don’t want what they offer you CANNOT use the fridge to put your own items in it or you’ll be charged $50 per day.  The shower door seemed to be closing properly but for some reason after my shower there was water all over the floor and the two double French doors to the bathroom don’t lock at all.  The vent for the AC/HEATER is way too small for such a big room.  AFTER we checked in we were told that the hotel power would be shut off for 2 hours starting at 1am. If that was a predetermined thing why wasn’t it made known to us AHEAD of time a day or two BEFORE we showed up? Nothing had power except for hallway lights the room itself was completely dark I.e. no TV or power to any outlets.
30,Overall Mandalay Bay was satisfactory. Although I was late to a shower after having to wait for an engineer due to shower drain not draining water I was provided a new room. A little disappointed that the staff did not offer a comp after explaining the inconvenience this caused.
50,Excellent Hotel to stay in when you go to Las Vegas. value was great and staff were friendly. Very convenient location. Don't go to the buffet is not worth the money unless it's was given for free. But they have other great restaurants
50,I really loved our room the service was super the restaurants were great loved the house of Blues for breakfast and the casino was awesome because it allowed me to play and win enough to make it fun  I lost but what a great trip
40,So just to let you know you are the furthest casino from all the entertainment. You have to do a lot of walking to just get to see the entertainment and night life. But you come here for the pool. This has by far the best pool out of all the resorts. The pool is just incredible and you get to slide through the casino and shark tank!
50,The stay was great. Wish our hair dryer would of worked and they would of been more punctual getting us one up there. The cleaning staff was on point and great. Really like the pool view to buy airport is a little loud!
50,I took my daughter to Vegas to celebrate her recent graduation from nursing school. Mandalay Bay was our first choice of resorts. At check in I believe he was a manager and hearing it was our first trip to Vegas gave us an upgrade to strip view.  The view was incredible. I could see all the way down it and the lights offered a spectacular view.  The room itself was very nice and large. The decor was soothing and the towels were soft the bed was the type of bed you don’t want to get out of.  My only complaint and I understand is common amongst many hotels is lack of a refrigerator. They have a stocked mini bar that has sensors when anything is moved.  The dining options were very good. The brunch buffet excellent the dinner menu good with a nice variety of choices. We also at at house of Blues on property and enjoyed the food there.  The pool was open although too chilly for me. The pools not open this time of year looked incredible  I have heard so much about this property being too far from main strip. I have severe mobility issues and had no issues taking free tram from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur. There is New York and Park Hotel right there as well as MGM and a free tram from Park to Belligio.  There are also rideshares everywhere and convenient.  I loved visiting the sights and being around the crowds in am and going back To Mandalay Bay at night and never feeling in a herd of cattle here like other hotels in area.  The resort is so spacious you never even when crowded feel crowded.  The casino go lively at night again never felt hoarded in. I loved variety of games. They also have a lot of older games I’ve always enjoyed that you can’t find elsewhere. They also have the newest releases and I found the casino payed me more of my money back compared to most.  I also saw quite a few people hit nice jackpots.  This resort is one I will always recommend to others and look forward to going back to visit.  The staff at every level were always professional and genuinely helpful.
20,"I'm not a gambler but still thought it would be fun to stay on strip. Mistake. I felt trapped and taken advantage of at MB. Room has no usable fridge for leftovers (mini fridge filled with alcohol. $50 a day to use for personal use! and an actual weighting mechanism to detect and catch you if you snuck something in there!). Also no coffee in room unless you buy the ""coffee kit"" for some exorbitant amount. Plus no cold water in my room (to be fair I never called maintenance thinking problem would resolve). Def will stick with Hilton next time."
30,This hotel has over 2700 rooms so the chance of getting an early check in pretty rare! Our room and bed were very comfortable but was disappointed with the noise that came from our neighbours room in the middle of the night it was almost like a stranger was in our room. The mini bar rules over the top alarmed so beware not even sure if tea and coffee are provided. Don’t think I would stay here again especially as smoking is allowed in the casino area my eyes and nose never stopped running. The breakfast was nothing to write about and slow to deliver 45 min after our order.
40,It was nice I liked my stay here. The room was really private. Walls were very strong it cut out neighbors noise. The hotel staff was very friendly. The bathroom was very nice and relaxing. Room service was very fast and understandable .
50,Had a very nice room. Heated pool available. But the rest of the outdoor pools were closed since its still winter and very cold. But it would be nice to visit again during summer time. Excited to experience the BEACH. Fyi you cant use the fridge doing so would cost an additional 50usd. No microwave as well. 15usd per night for self park. Hope this gave an idea of the things to consider. But for us will definitely come back.
30,Needs to have higher quality food and quality workers that follow hotel procedures. I had things stolen from me in the spa an it was never dealt with or settled. I had to walk away missing more than $400.
50,No matter where we stay we end up gambling at the Mandalay. Table minimums change with crowd. No hotel traffic walking needlessly through the casino floor. They have all our favorite machines. Crazy Money II is by far the best.
50,I stay at the Mandalay Bay for the location and great swimming pools. I have a four year old grandson and there is a variety of pools to choose from and I feel safe with the shallow pool and lazy river. It's a great location and the staff if friendly and professional.
30,I’ve done writing enough no hot boiler no hot water for me to make milk for babies. Infact the guest service said 15$ for a cup of hot water. The wifi kept switching on and off and I asked why and is there any solutions for me and the guest service says no. And not even sorry about it. I don’tthink I’ll ever stay at MGMResorts anymore.
50,Had a nice family weekend trip. Great restaurants and the Shark Reef was great for the kids. Can't wait to come back in the summer to swim in those great pools. The poker has some great action. The casino bartenders are extremely friendly.
50,Beautiful facilities and able to handle the huge crowds. Staff very friendly and sooooo helpful. Pool/hot tub very nice and designed to look out at the mountains from multiple tiers. Never disappointed with the buffet.
50,This hotel is a great place to recharge your batteries and get some much needed relaxation and entertainment.The restaurants are high quality and customer focused. The casino floor is well maintained and very enjoyable to play in.
50,I loved my room - I slept like a baby! My only complaints were about mobile check in - supposed to save time but my room was still not ready at 3pm check in despite being told through out the day it was being worked on...ended up having to just go to regular check in and agree to a different room (two queens vs one king).so the mobile check in was kind of pointless.  My only other ding was on the cleanliness of the bathroom noticed a lot of dust on the base boards in toilet closet.
10,see previous comments re $12 for coffee and price not displayed in room and wrongfully quoted $5 when I called the operator on Wed Feb 5. Check out girl could not have cared less. Clearly she seemed used to the issue and told me i should have turned on the tv menu to view the prices of the coffee? Seriously? when a sign in the room purposely says $50 RESTOCKING FEE FOR mini bar in the fridge when clearly the coffee cups were not in the fridge.  WORSE rip off ever. Never again.
30,Mattress way too soft. I can feel the springs. Feels like I was sleeping in motel 6 bed. I requested a shower cap for my wife and it took them FORTY MINUTES to bring it. I had to call twice after the initial request!!!
10,My husband and I frequent begas ths was our first time at mandalay bay. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.  First night: we paid to upgrade our room seemed awesome great deal our view was incredible. Went to shower after being up nearly 20 hours. It stunk and had sewage. We had to leave the roomnforntwo hours for it to be fixed and cleaned. Slept fine next night same situation. Front desk moved us into an upgraded room they claimed. It wasnt it was an awful view and nowhere near as nice. The bathroom had clumps of hair. So went down to get that fixed and was told they cant do anything for us. never NEVER NEVER AGAIN SO HORRIBLE
30,We stayed here for 2 nights as got a great deal but the hotel does need a revamp. Beds were exceedingly comfortable and big rooms though. Not impressed with the breakfast buffet nor the area as so outdated and drab . To be honest there are more modern hotels you can stay in and not pay for valet parking either.
50,Great all around. Price was what I thought and the room was more than expected. I will visit again. We only stayed one night. Room service was a little expensive but was good. Great hotel for future Raider games.
10,I was on business at a convention. They could not accommodate the amount of people they had at all! We waited in line 45 min for starbucks and an hour for lunch. To use the Krupps machine in the room it cost $6 or more. I have stayed at numerous hotels this last year and that has always been included. So I walked down and bought a drip coffe for $6.50 and a water for about the same.
40,Great location if you are attending a tradeshow at the hotel. Plenty of restaurants to choose from.  The only cavet it was hard to get coffee in the morning without having to stand in ridiculously long lines. MORE COFFEE stations please. Especially for regular coffee drinker i.e. black coffee or coffee with just cream. Would have made my stay much nicer.
10,Someone left dirty room service dishes outside my room and it was never picked up. I was there for 3 days and 2 nights and by the time I checked out I could smell the dirty dishes - absolutely disgusting. I don't understand why housekeeping didn't just pick them up when they cleaned the rooms.
30,Expect more from here. We had to pay a deposit months in advance for our reservation. Upon check-in not able to get the room we reserved. It did not even appear that the resort was busy. Our reservation wasn't honored customer service was poor didn't care about our concerns.
10,"I booked a King room and was given a double queen instead. The reasoning was they don't actually book a room by type as they just simply hold a room for you. I was then told they would move me when a King room was available and no one EVER contacted me. They then ""discounted"" my room to the rate it would have been had I booked the room I was given.    Terrible service!!!!"
50,Mandalay Bay is consistently the best place to stay in Vegas. Great rooms and staff always friendly! Plenty of things to do in the hotel and multiple choices for dining options. Will keep coming back!!
50,We have always stayed at Bellagio previously but wanted to give Mandalay Bay a try. We were not disappointed at all and the same great service we expect from MGM was appreciated. Very friendly and clean a beautiful and amazingly large venue.
40,Beautiful property. Have stayed here many times over the years and can say with confidence that Mandalay Bay is dollar for dollar the best value in Vegas. Only complaint is that we specifically booked a king room and were told upon check in that only queen rooms were available (not ideal for an anniversary stay). Any king suites that were available they wanted charge extra for. Typically at other properties (eg: Caesar’s Palace) if they are sold out of the rooms of the requested bed arrangement they will upgrade to a suite (if available) free of charge if that’s what is required to get the customer the as booked single king/two queens layout. They were kind enough to eliminate one nights resort fee for the inconvenience but those are a whole other discussion (especially when the nightly room rate is comp’d).
40,Room was clean my only disappointment was they did not give me a higher floor with a better view. I was put on the 3rd floor due to no other rooms with King size beds. Also there iron was the cheaps iron I ever seen or used in my life!
20,Hidden fees poor casino service no available staff to help guests find their way around. Fees for using the refrigerator in you room. I took my husband for his birthday and we spent at least $400 in he casino between us and I got 1 drink and he got 2 in the span of 2 days. Up side was the room was clean and the beds were nice.
50,Had a very nice stay in the hotel and visit to a conference at the conference center. Everything we needed was there including a comfortable room and bed very helpful staff great food an interesting casino beautiful views and outdoor area. Just a very nice stay.
10,"My tv service was intermittent for a recent 6 night stay at Mandalay Bay the customer service people who man the phones kept telling me ""it was because it was windy that affects the satellites"" - which is just ridiculous if you think of it the satellites are in space 2 tech visits still not working finally a call to one of the hotel managers admitted to me they've been having problems with the TV service for 2 weeks and an outside firm was coming in to reset it (which did not work) So if you have any desire to have good TV service I would stay away from Mandalay Bay!"
10,No Coffee in room. No pool or Jacuzzi. Terrible room svc. Staff walked in on me naked. To and from airport costs way too high other classy hotels have shuttles felt like they just wamted handouts dor everything even drinking water wow.....
10,WiFi does not work but you are charged  5.50 for a bottle of water is insane  Rooms outdated  No energy resort lounges  Has homeless people sitting and harassing at the video poker with no security there to get them out . My friend and I handled it ourselves
20,For the cost of this hotel you would think you could use the fridge. Nope. Unless you want to pay $50. They have snacks in the room... $20 for some Pringle’s if you are hungry.  The room was clean when we got here until we looked at the bed. The down comforter was filthy covered in hair!!!!!!!!! Gross! We called and they brought a new one but come on they don’t change the blankets????  Will choose a different hotel next time.
50,Loved every minute of our stay. Would stay there every time I come to Vegas. Much to offer and lots to do inside and near the hotel. I was sad we had to leave. Slept like a baby at night so we could party hard during the day.
50,Mandalay Bay is always our Las Vegas Go TO. No Smoke smell in the Casino Lobby Or Rooms is a huge Plus. Love the Restaurants People and Casino. Great Place to Stay while in Las Vegas. Good Lounge Music too.
30,Beautiful hotel many choices of restaurants but location is at the far end of the strip. My only complaint was with my room. I was on a non-smoking floor and It smelled like weed throughout my 3 night stay. Instead of offering me a new room housekeeping came in with a deodorizer and sprayed the room.
40,The room was better than expected. Don’t touch the snacks or use the refrigerator. Bedding was nice. Bathroom was clean. No problems with the room. Fast check in. Had a credit of 30 dollars per day to eat at some of the restaurants and bars. Don’t miss the Michael Jackson show. Buffet was good and house of blues was good as well. I would stay again but next time I may stay more centrally located on the strip.
50,This is our 15th time staying at Mandalay Bay the VIP staff is amazing. Angeli in the penthouse the such an awesome person she is a blast to spend time with him while they’re at the hotel. Our casino host Liz always treats us well  she’s an amazing person we are very comfortable there in the hotel because of her and the staff. We have choices to say when we go to Las Vegas but we choose to stay at Mandalay Bay.
10,My wife and I just arrived and the frustration level is through the roof. My wife needs handicapped parking walking long distances is very painful. Mandalay Bay’s parking structure has 4 levels and I’m guessing there are about 10 spaces on each level so for the whole hotel there are maybe 40 spaces. Then trying to get on the elevator took 15 minutes because there is an expo at the hotel and cart after cart of containers is taking up the elevators. I thought that after the lawsuit for letting someone bring an arsenal into the hotel there would be some kind of regulation on large containers but apparently not.  So I call the front desk to inquire about the lack of handicapped parking and see if there was some way to alleviate my wife from being dropped off in the garage while I search for any open parking. I spoke with a guest services agent and though cordial had no information on parking. I spoke with a guest services manager who seemed a little put off by my questions. The manager first said that the amount of handicapped spaces met regulations and later said he did not know how many spaces the hotel has. I was just asking for some kind of help any assistance for my wife but revived nothing I felt like anyone with a disability is not given any consideration. After unpacking my wife is laying down with ice on her ankle. We have stayed at Mandalay before but surely after such impersonal treatment and lack of consideration we feel unwelcome and unwanted. We were willing to let the many minor issues
20,Room and location were nice but don't touch anything in your mini bar unless you plan on consuming it (you'll be charged regardless of actual consumption) and DONT EAT THERE. Maybe I'm spoiled living in a farm to table community but the food is TERRIBLE. Everything tasted like it was previously frozen.
50,Excellent place to stay on the strip. Very clean and friendly staff that help those not familiar with the table games. The free tram makes it easy to visit other casinos and restaurants in the area. Also have some excellent restaurant choices in the hotel.
20,cold and impersonal service by staff the casino was very spread out with very poor service by the cocktail staff timeliness for cleaning rooms was very poor- attempted to clean the room at 6 pm lack of staff available to ask questions unless you approached the front desk
50,I’ve been staying at the Mandalay Bay for years and it’s consistently a wonderful stay. This time around we visited in late January. I usually favor this resort because of the amazing wave pool and lazy river but during the winter it’s closed. This year I decided to ask if any of the resorts many pools were open? And they actually had a nice area open not the summer pools but the private area. I was expecting a small pool and hot tubs but in true Mandalay fashion it was more then I imagined. Two large hot tubs and one medium sized pool with a nice bar! I’m definitely going to stay during the winter again. It was a sunny day and 72 degrees it was a perfect day by the pool in January!
50,We flew all the way from Orlando FL to see the Aerosmith concert @ The Park Theatre. Our Casino Host Brittany made our reservations & gave us VIP checkin status which is located in a private room stocked with an assortment of adult beverages & snacks. We visited there often & became familiar with some of the most hospitable hosts anywhere in Vegas! The rooms at Mandalay are some of the most spacious accommodating & stylish rooms that I've stayed in. The dining choices were varied & plentiful (especially loved Strip Steak). We are planning on making this trip again very soon & will d ed definitely be staying again at Mandalay Bay!
30,OK the room was nice and the beds were really comfortable. Just really annoys me that there is a nice sized mini fridge in the room but if you put anything in it you get fined $50 but hey they do have an ice bucket. This would be in addition to the $40+ resort fee for I'm not sure what. Beware if you pick anything up from the food tray in the room to look at it you could be charged for it as it is done on a weight basis. We were kind of afraid to use the in room soap or to take a shower as were afraid we might be charged extra for it. Staff were friendly and helpful. This place is huge and so easy to get lost in. Seriously you could spend the night searching for your room. Next time will stay somewhere else.
40,The pool area looks unbelievable but due to the cold weather we could not enjoy that area next time we will go in April. The tram was also very convenient to get to the New York area. The price was a great value
50,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Mandalay Bay. The room we were in was big with a very comfortable bed. Bathroom had a separate tub and shower. We had a great view of the pool area. Just wish we were there in the warmer weather to take advantage of the pools and lazy river. There was one small outdoor heated pool open and hot tub available but we didn't go in them. Dinner at the buffet was very good. One of the best buffets we have had in Las Vegas.
50,Very nice hotel. We definitely go back to this hotel and recommend it to my friends. It’s just the casino they took me there. Keep losing. The restroom and guest parking are far. I appreciate the staff very accommodating.
50,This review is from back in August but better late than never. Mandalay Bay is one of our favorites in Las Vegas. This stay was no different. We had a comped stay but were able to upgrade to a suite on the 60th floor for $100/nt. The suite was fantastic with a bedroom and separate living area. Also had a small kitchenette with a half bathroom attached. The one negative that I noticed and did not think about was the high floor and summer heat. At times it felt like the AC was having a tough time keeping up. Moorea is a favorite pool of ours to go to and this was no different. The casino was a bit quiet but still a fun time.
10,This was the first time I visited this hotel and was told to check out on my phone which I tried to do and it didn’t work set told me I had to call which I did and the lady who helped checked me out ended up hanging the phone up on me and she was rude
10,Weak drinks rude bartenders terrible front desk service (had the room comped for up to 4 nights ahead of time - still charged me afterward). Sports Book is awful - long lines $500 bet to get 1 free drink coupon? Terrible. Place is a total dump and a waste of time and money.
10,Ordered room with king bed showed up and they gave us 2 queens. Thought it would be easily fixed I was wrong. They said they dont guarantee room that you pick when you order they just guarantee a room. Windows whistle all night because black tape they used to seal window was ripping off. Called them twice they kept saying someone was showing up no one ever did. Finally falling asleep and then they call at 8am next morning asking me if anybody ever showed up. It's sad this used to be my favorite hotel will not be going here again.
50,Mandalay Bay connects to the MB convention center making it the perfect place to stay. The rooms are great and have coffee available which is a plus. A great market by the elevators and wonderful restaurants. Everything you need under one roof.
40,First time staying at Mandalay Bay. Overall we had a good experience. Rooms were very clean. Staff were very nice. Its a little further down the strip than what I am use to but overall I recommend staying here.
50,I came out here mainly for business but had my fun and pleasure as well. Service was great room was great hotel great and clean. I would recommend this hotel any single friend and business colleagues
10,After returning to Las Vegas after about 10 years  my wife got tickets to a concert for me for a Christmas present we decided to stay at Mandalay Bay and what a mistake we had booked a King and the said they didn't have one available and then the rooms never got cleaned same towels we had used and glasses we had used not replaced with clean ones guest services were rude as I stated to them been out and about seeing Las Vegas and return to our rooms and find them not cleaned if you could just pass this on to housekeeping the front desk asked in a rude tone did we want them to come up and bring fresh towels and glasses and I said it would have been nice to comeback and find a nice clean room. So never again and thanks Mandalay Bay for making the experience at your hotel the worst.
30,No coffee inc in room. Tv didnt work well. Too far from the action. No ventilation in room bathroom had no fan and continuous system was inadequate. Price on all minibar was way out of line. Spa pricing too high.
20,"Wait in line 30 minutes to check-in. Purchase an upgraded 2 bedroom suite and find it old few amenities small and limited towels no bathrobes. Service is terrible more help at a Motel 6. No bellmen to help with bags car valet doesn't lift a finger. Hotel restaurants are ridiculously over-priced for what is offered -- and the $30 per day ""food allowance"" wasn't honored at any of the hotel restaurants I visited.  The place is going to eventually be updated (renovated) -- you have a chance to be one of the last to visit this place before it is repaired.  Note that the employees are angry -- I was told that they are being charged for parking.  No way I will return . . . there are too many other choices."
50,Awesome stay everything you would need is on property. Staff was extremely helpful and security was prominent to add that extra bit of comfort. Room was Very Clean and Comfortable and made sleeping very relaxing. Great Job Mandalay Bay Staff
50,As usual I had a fantastic time at the Mandalay Bay. The staff is always friendly and the rooms are always clean cozy and stylish. I really enjoy staying at this property everything about it is super convenient.
40,After a lot of years staying Hard Rock have transitioned to Mandalay Bay for annual Super Bowl trip. Love the casino and property. Still trying to figure out MLife points but in meantime getting some decent offers. Sticking with MLife hoping it pays off with more perks moving forward.
50,Beautiful hotel. Cleanest casino and hotel in Vegas that I've stayed at. Excellent food options. Well suited convention center. I appreciate the quiet clean and comfortable rooms. The convenience stores inside are extremely overpriced like all Vegas amenities so if you need something I'd recommend a quick trip to a regular store in town.
40,Generally ok for business purposes. Room has the same decoration for the past 8 years or so. Convenient access if your convention is at this facility. SPA could use some help. The folks at the front desk were helpful and friendly. Housekeeping does a good job keeping the rooms clean and neat
30,Nice room clean spacious. Disappointed room not ready when we checked-in after 3:00 pm. No in-room coffee. Charge you $50 to use refrigerator if you want to store your own food. South end of the strip worked well to see shows at MGM and New York. I did like the water station in hotel lobby to fill up water bottles. It was a nice place to stay a night don’t know I would go back.
50,I love it if you put refrigerator's in the rooms my trip would be much better. Think about this my left overs from a meal was enough for breakfast. When I woke up it looked spoiled. So I went to get more that was at another casino. I ended up staying there a while and not playing at the Mandalay Bay. If I
40,Don’t stay here the employees have a very bad attitude and they don’t care about customer service. They don’t really care about you and the booking you made they just want to get rid of you to go home
50,Mandalay Bay is just awesome. Had a great 4 night stay. Food at Rivea was great and Buffet was good also. Drinks at Foundation Room at Delano is great place to relax. Stayed in room 17-334. Had great view of new stadium Mirage T Mobil Stadium and Luxor. How great is that.
20,If staying at the Mandalay Bay resort expect to bring an extra $50 to use the in room mini fridge or sacrifice your sink and fill it with ice every hour. Test your shower before getting in it to make sure it drains and is free of calcium build up. I didn’t spend almost $500 on the room for 2 nights to spoil a bunch of food and feel like needing a shower right after showering.
10,guest room had no wifi broken desk lamp broken fridge was then charged for drinks from mini-bar which I did not drink. spent 3 hours on the phone trying to resolve the issue which finally occurred when i was moved to a different room
40,Great restaurant options including buffet shopping a market for late night snacks drinks milk etc. Live music was awesome at Hazel Rythmn and Riffs House of Blues etc. There is even an aquarium. I have spent a total of 9 nights here on 2 seperate trips and have not seen the whole complex yet. They should not charge the full resort fee during the winter when the pools are not open and their drink prices are more expensive than most other places I visited.
40,Great resort clean rooms and delicious food. Also they give free parking to active military personnel and give you Pearl level for M rewards. Will stay here again if the price remains the same. Wish it was a little closer to the strip. Perhaps they can build a tram that connects the rest of the strip to the Mandalay Bay. Check out the Michael Jackson One show. It is incredible! It’s the best show I’ve ever seen!
50,Best location to stay in for ITSE of course but I couldn’t be more pleased with the friendliness and professionalism exhibited by all the team members of Mandalay Bay. I’ll definitely be back for a non related work trip. My trip was too short !
40,Mandalay Bay is without question what people probably think of as the classic gambling casino. Twinkling crystal chandeliers? Check. Ornate free-standing roulette wheel? Check. Sleek and stunningly attractive cocktail waitresses in formal wear? Check. All that's missing is James Bond in a tuxedo.    Plus it has live music really high ceillings (a big benefit if you don't smoke) and tons of great shopping at high-end stores close at hand.    The Bellagio and the Wynn get a lot of press on the Strip but the Mandalay Bay casino is where you should go if you want genuine classic casino luxury and phenomenal people-watching on the floor. Plus they have their own tram to get you to the main part of the Strip and back.
50,Had a great time here in the casino and the conference hall. The games were fun and the service was great. The conference halls were also amazing. Highly recommend checking this spot out! The food courts are great too
30,Property was okay. Nothing to glamorous or hyped enough to talk about. They charge for everything including the fridge. $50 bucks a day to use there fridge. Also they don't tell that if you pay the 24 bucks a day for valet use can park your car at other MGM property's. We didn't find that out til our last day. So we spent quite a bit of money on taxis per day. We will stay in the center of the strip next time.
