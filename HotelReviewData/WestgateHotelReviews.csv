50,Enjoyed our stay at the Westgate forgot some items in our hotel room and had a wonderful experience working with Lupe and Kiasha the items left were personally important so it was wonderful to have them returned. Great customer service.
50,The entire staff at the Westgate is just lovely!! They are friendly and accommodating! I recently had interactions with Chris Eva and Lila who is one of the greeters. They all welcome you with warmth and friendliness. On top of that this is one of the few hotels left in Vegas that is literally steeped in history with great performers of the past and present making it their home. The entertainment is great and the sports book and food court are huge. Definitely make this one a part of your stay in Vegas!!
50,Excellent get away. Rooms were clean! Forgot an item in my room and Lupe and Yessenia ensured I got it back. Amazing staff and customer service definitely will be returning to this hotel soon! Restaurants were amazing as well
50,Venue is awesome Casino not so much-didn‚Äôt win see add is great food court is delicious just wish we could have won some money‚Ä¶.will definitely be back! Have stayed here before and rooms are amazing!
50,I was only in Vegas for a few days and Amy Davis who is in charge of the hotels social media managed to arrange an unofficial Elvis Tour for myself! I‚Äôm still in shock this was even possible and I‚Äôll forever be grateful for Amy taking the time out of her busy day to show me around. She was so kind funny and knowledgeable. Thank you so much Amy! Fantastic member of staff
50,Kara has a wonderful personality and a awesome voice...always nice to hear real talent! She was very interactive with the crowd and kept everyone engaged and highly entertained. Hopefully I'll be able to see her again!
50,In house greeters at the owners lounge Army Ron and Antonia has done an excellent job greeting you with a friendly smile and kept the place clean and well stocked. Our host Ross have been very friendly and helpfull telling us what's new in Vegas and how to make the most of our stay here at Westgate
20,Pool was supposed to be heated it was cold. They blared hideous music in the pool deck all day. Drove us nuts. Couldnt block it out with head phones. The casino and restaurants were just OK. We at a Sals and sportsbook. Bot too bad but expensive. Nicest part was the monorail stop was right at the hotel.
50,I lost my cell phone on 2/27/23 and two great women helped me out in lost and found department. First Kiasha patiently provided me the phone numbers to call regarding my mobile provider and mobile company. She assisted me for a long time and didn‚Äôt stop to help me. She really cares about helping me out and retrieve my cell phone. Kiasha made me feel better because of an outstanding service she had given me. On the other hand I also spoke to Yesenia on the same day and saw her in the restroom the following day and told me about a returned cell phone in their department. I just need to go to Lost and Found and wait for her to get back to work. After a few minutes she searched for my missing phone. She asked me specific things like the description of my phone and she found it for me. I signed paperwork and very satisfied with the outcome. Kiasha and Yesenia were wonderful and I am extremely happy with these two women. They know how to help me out and really cares about to what they do. Thanks ladies for all your help. I do appreciate your hard work.
30,Came for a work conference and got a dated room with a Murphy bed. Not a good vibe. Sad. The room wasn‚Äôt meant to be a bedroom but a meeting room. Really should not rent out that room. Called the front desk and got moved to much better room in the East tower. Brand new clean and beautiful. :)
50,Vince in the EVS dept was very helpful in the hall way.. there was a spill and he made sure we did not fall ty!!  He kept the area very clean and. Come to find out he has family in my home town‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a small town
50,Our Elvis group visited the hotel to review the history of the hotel and Elvis time there. Thanks to all the hotel personnel to get our group situated with accommodations and the opportunity to visit history locations within the hotel in relation to Elvis time there.    A special thanks to Mr. Westgate who was so courteous throughout our stay and shared some time with the group as well.
50,Janice T at Westgate resorts hotel was very Friendly Helpful and lovely to chat with. She is a lovely person. I loved the fact that she smiled constantly and made sure our... my needs were taken care of. Thank you Janice I'm great to have meet you üòä
50,My checkout experience with Lyndia at the front desk made my total experience at Westgate Las Vegas worth re-living time and time again. Normally at the end of a vacation you are disappointed you have to end it. Lyndia cheered me up with her welcoming smile as if I had just arrived to check-in. It was not about how much I planned to spend. Lyndia was glad I was there!! One reason to go back to Westgate would be to experience her smile combined with job knowledge professionalism courtesy and just great customer service. Finally. hours after I checked out she kept her word to contact guest services and call me about the results of her research. Waitress (Monique) did a great and work hard. Great job Lyndia!!
40,Stay was ok. Room was nice once they rebooked us to corret location. Had to sit thru another time share hard sell (3+ hours) since we went on a VOA. The two women (Aida and Fe) in the owners club that helped us were amazing.
50,Definitely come here. The people want you to enjoy your time and not care about anything but having a blast! The sports book is the best. Place to be. No wonder ESPN has a booth here. In addition the restaurants are great. Ate at both the edge and fresco and just bam in your mouth goodness.
20,After a five hour drive leaving at 5am from Southern California through a snow blizzard to meet our son who was flying in to LasVegas we called the hotel to request early check in. We were told that if we wanted to checkin before 1pm that we would have to pay an extra $40. This was outrageous considering all the extra fees we were already charged and compared to other hotels at which we have stayed. But sure enough when we arrived at 11am after our long scary drive we were forced to pay an extra $40 to check in at 11am. We were so exhausted by the time we got to the room we weren‚Äôt picky. Though I notice a heavy chemical smell probably from disinfectant spray. Later I realized there was no coffeemaker in the room. I called the front desk and was told there are NO COFFEEMAKERS in any rooms The next day I learned there is NO WATER. I brought water for the journey but ran out. I went to the Fitness Center and although there was a large ‚ÄúCulligan‚Äù water bottle it was empty! I asked the woman at the spa where I could get water. She told me I would have to buy it at a hotel store. The stores price gouge ($5 for small Pepsi). I called the front desk to ask for water and was told that the hotel provides no potable water and that I would have to buy it. My husband and I drove to the supermarket to buy water and coffee.  This hotel is rundown. One of the North Tower elevators is stuck open and the other elevators take very long. I walked to different elevators to haul up gallons of water cold coffee and milk for coffee. One of the sink faucet handles doesn‚Äôt turn (hot) and the sink basin is old and cracking. The sheets are rough and scratchy. I woke up with a rash.  This hotel isn‚Äôt cheap. We paid $287 plus fees to be treated like beggars. Find a better hotel.
40,"The nostalgia of this hotel overwhelmed some of the service problems. Looking up at Elvis' private quarters from six floors away from our room was an experience I wasn't expecting at this property. The hotel makes great pains to be contemporary but it was difficult to see it that way. I appreciated the distance of Westgate from the strip - even just 10-15 minutes away it was enough to feel relaxed and away from the hustle of the strip. We liked having the availability of Starbucks - there are no coffee amenities or microwaves in the rooms. We struggled to get housekeeping on a consistent basis. I started calling them before we left for the day to request services. I was asked ""Do you want bathroom services only or the whole room?"" I am guessing they are short staffed. Resort fee absorbed the parking. There were ample parking spots at all times. Close proximity to McDonalds and Dennys if you don't want to pay for resort food for every meal. We had a car and were glad we did. There is a free shuttle that runs to the strip from the strip every two hours which we did one day. We did not take the Monorail which has a stop at the Westgate. Our room was okay - on the smallish side and showing age but it worked. I saw some dust. Note: There is a $15 daily fee for having multiple people use the Internet in the room. We did not see any signs about this. In summary I have wonderful memories of our time in Vegas and at the Westgate. I would probably stay there again."
50,They are friendly and nice persona.I appreciate their services. We need more people like the gave in us that service that we deserve and the new owners deserve to That the reason why always come to see them every time that I'm in town. Tkyou.
50,fe L‚ÄôOr√©al Aida were great kept food areas nice and clean. Very friendly and went out of their way to accommodate. Great smiles lovely to be greeted. It‚Äôs so important when you‚Äôre out of town to feel welcomed and appreciated so your staff go the extra steps to be wonderful.
50,My husband and I had the pleasure of meeting two beautiful spirited young ladies at Westgate in Las Vegas. My husband and I have been time share owners since 1994. We were greeted by L‚ÄôOr√©al and Antonia. They were very professional courteous and accommodating to all of our requests. They both exemplified extraordinary customer service!    Satisfied Customers  Darnell & LaTanya
50,In town for fun vacay or business ?    Stop by the Westgate Resort for the best of nightlife ! Thurs nights is always a blast with HIGH ROCKTANE band : voted BEST of LAS VEGAS : 2021 & 2022 ( Las Vegas Review Journal )    Dance the night away 8- 12 am to hits from the 80's 90's and beyond ! Funnest band ever ...!
50,We came to the westgate hotel to have a look around and explore and Jimmy the front door man was the most lovely man. He was so warm and friendly couldn‚Äôt be more helpful and a true asset to the hotel! Would definitely stay there next time!    Thanks  Holly
10,First time ever writing a negative review. Book elsewhere. We had 12 rooms booked for a team. Promised 2 double beds per room got one bed per room. Then we were given roll out cots while a staff person tried to tell me they were sofa beds LOL! The 2 rooms booked under my name didn‚Äôt receive the cots till 1:30am the next day (5 hours of us waiting). Meanwhile the kids rooms were all over the hotel and not in one area. I have a list of 4 managers that I spoke to and 10 staff. They will promise one thing and do another. If you do stay here check your confirmation and charges DAILY as the charges will be wrong EVERY. SINGLE TIME. I spent more time at the front desk than I did in my own room. Keep a track of every single person you speak to (in your phone) as they will NEVER have notes and they will plead ignorance every single time. I wish I could say it was one staff but it‚Äôs not. From the initial booking to the final day this hotel is a nightmare to deal with. And the rooms are a 2 star at best. If you need a list of the staff I‚Äôm happy to provide it to you. Worst hotel of my life with zero accountability. Because I was at the front desk so much I overheard a lot of conversations with guests and the hotel staff and the screw ups and aloofness was common practice for this hotel. The location also sucks at it‚Äôs a 10 min Uber to the Las Vegas Strip and there is nothing near the hotel. To give you a comparison I stayed at the Vdara before coming here with the team and the Vdara was amazing in every single way and cost me less than this stressful hotel LoL!!
50,It was mine and my family‚Äôs first time at the Westgate. We were very impressed by how beautiful clean beautiful scent of the Westgate.  Mr Westgate was the highlight of our visit at Westgate he was very friendly made us feel welcomed right away he was also very knowledgeable about the history of the hotel.  We definitely will be coming back
50,Had a wonderful time at the Westgate resort. The Manilow show was fabulous....definitely a must see while you are here. Barry puts on quite the show. The staff has been fantastic and so helpful. Our room is beautiful.
30,Stayed for five days for World of Concrete Convention. Not a single day did our rooms get cleaned. I had to call just to get supplies replenished in our room. There was a shortage of staff. We have stayed here for the convenience but will plan on staying elsewhere next year.
50,I am an owner at Westgate Resorts. This is my 2nd time here. My 2st experience with the room was very disappointing. I was satisfied with the room selection now. I had a beautiful view from the 27th flr. I went to the Westgate Club for the first time and again happy and very satisfied. I went during the evening when being a member between the hours of 5pm-7pm you can have all the beer wine beverages tea cheese platter fruit and vegetables with a breath taking view of the Westgate Sign and beyond. The in house greeters Kelsie & Aida were perfect. They were gracious professional polite warm and so much more. They kept the club clean and stocked. I already booked to return in October.
50,Awesome place first time here and I will be back. Visiting the Westgate Club was great. The atmosphere and view are breath taking. Kelsie and Aida were an absolute delight easy to talk to and kept the place very clean.
50,Miranda in Sports & Racing was so fantastic. This was my first time in Vegas and she was so helpful. I had an issue with my app and she was great making sure I was up and running before the Super Bowl started. Miranda thanks for making my trip so seamless.
50,Kevin the manager at the Westgate calmed me down and listened to me and solved the issue. Kevin is amazing!  I wanted to speak to a manager after being on hold for 2 hours and getting transferred when I just needed to add a name to the hotel room so they could check in early. The last receptionist did set everything up but couldn't fully understand what I was asking so I asked for the manager and he made sure that everything went smoothly!
50,Wonderful excellent service üëè at üíØ % If you owners get the gold card for free drinks! And the ladies are so nice! They clean up after you .. It's the best buy we did ! It's costly but worth every penny! Some come and enjoy !
50,L‚ÄôOr√©al  Aida and Antonia was amazing !! Very helpful and kind ! They all provided all our needs! They even gifted my friend with a bottle of expensive alcohol for her newly engagement!  This social gathering was terrific! Thank you beautiful ladies!
30,Front desk line took way too long to get us checked in. But when I got there Tyler T. At the Front Desk was very nice and professional. Rooms are nice but no soap or shampoo in the room when we arrived. If things don‚Äôt get better from here on out this will be my last stay here.
10,I planned a weekend with my son at Las Vegas and we decided to try the Westgate because it has tennis courts. We arrived to Check-in late at 11pm because of a late flight. The line to check in was about 40 people deep and they had two people at the desk. It took almost 2 hours to check in. We went to our room to find it in horrible state. It appears no one has redecorated since the 1960s. There was yellowing of the pain and it was peeling all over the room. There was an obvious water leak rippling to the dry wall in the corner where a wet bar made of 1960s brick stood. The room smelled of smoke. The bathroom had a plethora of water stains rust stains and hard water stains. The tile in the corner had lifted due to water damage. What was sold as a ‚Äúroom with two queens‚Äù was actually a room with a double bed and a roll away. We proceeded back to the front desk for another 2 hour wait and explained that we were not going to stay. I explained the condition of the room and the front desk actually agreed. I was refunded promptly. It appears there was a whole string of people doing the same thing as the couple next to us was doing the same thing. I think the hotel is renovating but only has a small portion done and throws everyone else in the horrible old rooms even though they advertise the new ones. I would strongly recommend avoiding this property and hotel at all costs. If you must book here book thru the hotel website and not third party or you won‚Äôt get your money back. The couple next to me was told they could not be completely refunded. What a mess this place is!
50,Rock Roulette was amazing they got the crowd going and we're so talented. Their choice of music picks were right on. The audience was dancing and singing! Best part of Westgate casino by far! Come to LA and play!
50,I attended a Kool and the Gang concert on a Friday Night and I would have given more than five stars if possible. Considering I went to high school in the early 70‚Äôs it was like a class reunion. I must mention that I actually arrived 45 minutes before the start and whoever lined up the pre-concert music was spot on. Some of the ushers had to politely stop people from dancing in the isles as they were guiding people to their seats and once the concert started it was hard to stay still. They sang all their popular songs including various instrumental additions; trombone trumpet and saxophone were big highlights for me as it was nice to hear real instruments. Robert ‚ÄúKool‚Äù Bell came forward and shared a little of the bands history. He‚Äôs been their bass guitarist for over 50 years. Hollywood Swinging Ladies Night and Celebration and others had you groovin through the night. I don‚Äôt care what age you are you can‚Äôt go wrong experiencing Kool & The Gang.
50,Loreal Aida Antonia are great staff friendly at the Westgate Owners Club! They made our time at the owners club pleasant and provided snacks and refreshments and always welcomed us with a smile. üòÅ
50,If you need to be taken care stay at the west gate they will take care of you. My dad is handicap and needs special help to get to his room. Craig at the front desk took care of my dad! I will forever be grateful for taking care of him. Westgate customer for life.
30,Nice property but anything you buy onsite is ridiculously priced. Got some Sudafed for $25.00. Breakfast at the buffet is a rip off @27/ per person. You are better off going to Sid's Cafe. Rooms are okay. Everyone is very friendly and helpful.
50,High Rocktane knows how to rock! Such a good time listening and rocking out with them definitely recommend watching them perform when they are near you! They interact with the audience and show you a good time!
50,Yes I'm just thankful I got a chance to meet the two ladies they are wonderful people. They treated me like they have been known me all my life and I was part of their family. I am the owner and Orlando and I'll come here and I get treated much better here than I do in my own home and Orlando. Just keep up the good hard work and keep caring about people thank you so much I cannot wait to come back again. Aaron
10,The worse experience!!! I went on one of their time share presentation while in Las Vegas Sunday February 5th. Richard started out being friendly wanting to know about my life and sharing about his life. However things quickly changed when I consistently said I was not going to purchase a time share. A female manager came over and tried to low ball me into purchasing and trying to insist I was not making a financial sound decision. Oh I was told not to use my cellphone as it looks like he(Richard was not working). I told them I wanted my $40 deposit back and they could keep those gifts offered. But instead allowing me to leave they sent over another guy and this is when I felt like I was being held against my will so I secretly called a friend who wasn't home but her voice mail recorded how I was yelling let me go!! Finally was allowed to leave but not without being insulted and told not to do another presentation. I would not recommend Westgate and I am in the process of seeing how I can change these presentations!! I have tried to contact customer service at Westgate to report this encounter but I have been given the run around. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
30,We went for March Madness. While the Sportsbook was good there were a lot of also run experiences. i.e checking in was uncool toilet in room backed up just trying to get a cup of coffee in the morning was challenging trying to get food while at the Sportsbook was a bummer and the food was less then good.  The property shows it‚Äôs age.
50,When I visited the owners lounge was greeted graciously by Kelsie & Aida the In house greeters. Kelsie helped me with trouble shooting my key Card. Aida was very informative and gave suggestions about dining and delivery options for food. Was very happy to have great customer service. Two thumbs up for Aida & Kelsie.!!!
50,It was a great hotel. The rooms were clean with very considerate cleaning staff who would clean rooms around night shifts. There were great facilities; gym washingrooms bars restaurants) and on the whole very friendly staff
50,Aida from the owners lounge is very gracious and accommodating. The check in process for the owners is very fast. There‚Äôs plenty of choice to drink at owners lounge on happy hours. The staff are nice.
50,Love the west gate! Had an amazing time down in the Casino! Tuni Randy and Jay are great dealers with a great energy to them! Also can‚Äôt forget about Robert! Can‚Äôt wait to get back for my next business trip!
10,Woke up with over 20 Bed Bug bites‚Ä¶  All they did was change my room and have yet to hear from a manager. Even though that they said they would call. Lady from risk management verified it was bedbugs.The bellhop was the only one who said he was sorry.
50,This was the first time that I came to the lounge with one of the owners and Aida and Kelsie was so nice and accommodating. They made sure I was comfortable amd made me feel like I was part of their family.
30,We stayed at WestGate casino because we stayed there before and enjoyed it a nice and clean casino but this time around was different (i mean still clean and nice casino but a different experience) we came with family (kids) we got there Friday and checked out Sunday as we are checking out we decided to eat at the fresh buffet and my 5 year old needed to use the restroom but didn‚Äôt make it and had an accident as soon as we got to the bathroom a cleaning lady (Ashley Ramirez if you encounter her stay away from her not polite or any type of customer service experience) was blocking the door due to a gentleman cleaning the inside and i asked her if it was going to be closed for a while i explained the situation and all she said there‚Äôs bathrooms on the other side mean while i have a child that had an accident and couldn‚Äôt walk any further i had to call my husband (leaving my 1 year old with mother-in-law having to make unnecessary actions) to come to the bathroom to take my son mean while the gentleman that was in the bathroom comes out and she is still blocking the entrance i‚Äôm assuming they had to change other things in there so finally my husband makes it to us takes my son in and all of a sudden a lady comes by and asked to go in and Ashley moved her cart to make way for the lady and other people to come in ü§¨ü§¨ like are you serious!!! you had us here waiting all this time and even when the guy got out of the bathroom couldn‚Äôt even let us in so i went up to her and told her i think it was a little messed up she did that and she looks at me rolled her eyes and said there was a guy in there i couldn‚Äôt let you go in and i told her he wasn‚Äôt in there all this time we could of gone in as soon as he came out so she just turned around ignoring me so i asked for her name and she kept ignoring me i literally had to ask her 4times for it until she mumbles it as she turned away and i asked her again and she said i already told you it‚Äôs ashley but all along she had an ATTITUDE!!!! i hope her managers and hotel General managers check the cameras to see her attitude and check her because she was rude from start to finish i asked for her manager of course not to her but to another staff member that was around and they did call one down mean while she is standing there with 2 other gentleman (cleaning staff) mocking me and acting out how it all happened (very unprofessional) and laughing as if it was so cool what she did to make the story short the manager came down he was the one that gave me her proper name he apologized and said they were gonna talk to her and tried to explain the situation i told him i‚Äôm not dumb i know she has to do her job and if there is a guy in there we can‚Äôt go in but courtesy and customer service is what you look for when you choose a hotel very disappointed with the way the situation got handled i just hope they do something about it because to a mother that is the worse experience to have someone do your kids wrong it had my blood boiling
50,The attendance was very helpful in house greeter the team is Aida and Maggie they did and excellent job doing the service and very kind persons when serving beverages and make sure that nothing is missing
50,My wife and I have been thoroughly impressed with the service we have received in the Westgate Owners Lounge. Great food and beverage selection and wonderful service by the friendly staff Aida specifically.
50,We went to listen to music and dance. High Rocktane was playing and they were fabulous. 4 piece band drums (good rhythm and nice voice) lead guitar (was also very good and good background singer) bass guitar (good player with a good rhythm and good voice) the lead singer was fantastic her voice was pure and on point). They played a nice mix of dance music. Well worth seeing them
50,First and foremost I had a very substantial first time visit at Westgate. The staff were very friendly and so are the slot machines ü§ë. My casino host Mary went above and beyond making my birthday a memorable occasion. I will be back on my next trip!
50,Not only was Tyler looking dapper he was a gentleman at its finest. Made me feel welcome seen and cared for. He started my stay off on such a good foot this is the only place I‚Äôll be staying when I come into town.
50,My family and I came to the hotel for ‚ÄúBattle for Vegas.‚Äù My wife had bought a group buffet pass; for our family. Unfortunately we were given the wrong times for the buffet by the school organizers and we completely missed the buffet. My wife was extremely upset she was upset not because of the buffet or money she was upset because the organizers already had inconvenience many of our group with misinformation. The school organizers showed no interest in fixing their mistakes. They didn‚Äôt even offer an apology. My wife is very shy and prefers not to ‚Äúrock the boat.‚Äù Me in the other hand I am a problem solver. I walked over to the front desk and spoke with the most polite and caring team member by the name T. Tyler. I was expecting to be received with no help at all. But T. Tyler was extremely attentive and helpful. He made a stressful situation much better. I work in law enforcement I am a commander and I believe it is important to recognize professionalism. I demand the level of professionalism Mr. T. Tyler showed from my staff. This staff [T. Tyler] member made my wife‚Äôs day; and for that I‚Äôm beyond grateful. Please recognize your team member [T. Tyler]. A member who made our last day here at the hotel much better. Thank you T. Tyler.
50,Aida is a lovely person working as in house greater in owners lounge in the Westgate Las Vegas resort. She provides an excellent service very attentive and has a positive attitude. Everyone who works in this department are very polite positive and friendly. The lounge is sparkling clean the food drinks and snacks are always replenished in timely manner. Great people great service! Thank you.
50,Aida was professional. Customer service was the best I ever had. I will definitely come back. She was amazing Kind and funny. Omg I love her what a great time. Really nice work a great personality. Can‚Äôt wait to come back
50,We love Westgate Las Vegas!!! Loreal & Aida work at the owners lounge and are just amazing! Aida has been so warm and welcoming! We absolutely feel like we are home here with the beautiful generosity and kindness that we feel from the people like Aida! Thank you for truly making this experience feel that much more special!!!
50,Spent a Thursday evening at the Westgate's International Bar during a recent convention trip to sit relax and have a drink. I saw a Live Band was setting up. I saw some local fans got there early and re-arranged their tables and chairs to all sit together. I stayed for another beer to check out the band and am I glad I did. It was Best Night I've had in a while during business travel. The band was named Rocktane which was 4 members. They used the aid of an iPad for some background instruments that they did not have live to create cover songs for a variety of club music. It was fun. I stayed all 4 sets. Felt like I was in college again at a Fraternity party. Band members were animated. Lead Vocalist (Kara) during some somgs walked thru the crowd to sing and/or dance with patrons. Passerbys stopped and watch. People danced. Definitely a memory to cherish. I go back to Vegas in October 2023 for another conference. I hope they are still around. See them if your travel allows. They play on Thursday nights. It's worth the Friday morning hangover.
50,Here‚Äôs my review.  We were at the Westgate in Vegas. Loreal & Aida are awesome! They made us feel VIP and very welcome. ü§óü•≥ü´∂üèªüçæüç∑ü•Çüçª  üßÄ  üßã  üé∞  üçª  üçØüç©üçøü´òü•úüç´üç¨üå∞üßÅüéÇüéÇüçÆüç≠üç©üç™üçµüç∂‚òïÔ∏èü´ñüßãüçªüç∑üßâüçΩÔ∏èüßäüçπ
40,Lydia from the Front Desk was most helpful during my recent stay for three nights. My initial room had some electronic issues so she nicely moved rooms for me in a newly renovated East Tower room. The process was fast pleasant and top notch!
50,I came to Vegas for the first time for the 2023 NAHB International Builderers' Show. I knew I would be meeting both current and new clients many for the first time in person and needed to look my best. Lyndia at the front desk met every accommodation I asked for and let me get the restful relaxing hotel experience I needed to perform at my best. 10/10 I Will be back again!
50,High Rocktane is not only musicians but performers! Crowds need to pay for admission. As a true lover of live music this group knocks it out the park. 10/10 will see again. Kara is an absolute amazing rock star with true vocal talent and the band is versatile. Do not waste this talent!
20,Hotel cancelled 3 of our rooms that we booked through the conference without letting us know. To make it right they gave us a two bedroom suite. The suite smelled like smoke one room was pumping AC when the heat was set at 78 and it was 30 outside. That room never got above 66. Other rooms didn‚Äôt get colder. The other bedroom abutted the elevator machine room which squeals screeches and creaks every 5 minutes ALL NIGHT.    And finally fresh smoke made it into the bathroom every so often‚Ä¶not sure from where.
20,The beds were OK. Everything else was terrible. No prices on anything in the stores. Extra resort fees. Disgusting overpriced food ($4 for a small bag of skittles!???) and rude staff that acts as if you‚Äôre an idiot when you ask for the price of something. Westgate HATES tourists. Vegas hates tourists. And I hate Vegas.
50,No complaints with this stay. We did have to change rooms due to air conditioning issues but that happened very quickly. We left some items in drawers in first room spoke with lost and found folks they had them and mailed them to us after we had already flown out. Staff was very friendly and helpful!
30,Good food and good waitresses. A special thanks to Juana who served us breakfast every morning. She was friendly and efficient.  Cafe is open for breakfast lunch and dinner. Usually a long line for breakfast if there's a convention.
50,I had the pleasure of being greeted and served by these magnificent women. I am truly grateful for their welcoming smiles and reception in the Owners Club House in Las Vegas. Thank you for your hospitality.
50,Upon check in for a business trip at the Westgate I was informed that our reserved room with 2 beds was not available for our 3-adult room and that we'd have to sleep in a room with 1 bed and a sofa. There were no other options available and if 1 opened the next day we'd need to change rooms. It was our responsibility to check back around noon and again 3 the next day.  We had unpacked printers laptops multiple chargers and been working like fiends for 12 hrs by the time a room became available when we spoke with Lyndia at the front desk the next day.  I asked her if it would be possible to simply stay put in the room w/1 bed plus sofa as repacking and moving would be arduous and the large table in our room was proving quite useful. Lyndia informed us that we were technically in a 'suite's and would need to ask for permission. Despite the busy desk Lyndia went to the back room then out towards the lobby to speak with a manager and was able to let us keep our room.  Corporate vacation screwed up by a major resort was SAVED by a compassionate sweet and outgoing front desk member named Lyndia!! WILL be back again and again.
50,This trip has been amazing. Room clean and hospitality has been great. Glenda and Aida was wonderful in the VIP room. This hotel is the best. So amazing we became owners at the Westgate. I‚Äôam ready to enjoy the Westgate experience.
50,The Hilton Staff Shakilah and M. Crawford made this blackjack experience one of the best gambling experiences. Shakilah is the best dealer I have ever had! I will definitely come back to the Hilton to gamble.
50,Lyndia provided unbelievable customer service and support. At the front desk she was very friendly and professional at the same time. She listened carefully to our concerns and took immediate action talking to her manager.She is a credit to her department and the hotel!!
10,We came to Las Vegas for the first time and stayed @ the Westgate Las Vegas. We immediately were greeted by the staff and shortly after this were offered a ‚ÄúHotel History and information package with free breakfast for the next morning‚Äù that would only take 90 min.  This experience on our first visit to Las Vegas is also our last it left more then a bad taste in our mouth it ruined our entire vacation.  We attended the ‚ÄúInformational experience‚Äù which turned out to be a Time share presentation we were promised that our $40 deposit would be returned we would get a free Breakfast for attending and a $100 Gift card / credit to use @ the hotel.  We attended the session ate wandered around the hotel for a little bit and we would hardly call that a history of the hotel but it sure was a Time share presentation that did not take 90 min it took almost 3 hours.  Our Presenter ‚ÄúSteve‚Äù was polite and no complaints of him but when we said we could not afford to invest this kind of money at this time into a time share he said no problem and we would get out gifts anyway as promised and agreed upon. He said he had to call over his ‚ÄúManager‚Äù (Heidi) and she started off polite and turned into an aggressive and verbally assaulting us pretty fast. Trying to pit my wife and I against each other and trying to pick fights with us at the table to the point my wife jumped up and ran off in tears as she is not a bad person and the rude women (Heidi) was trying to make us out to be for not being able / interested in their time share my wife told them to keep their stupid gifts and ran off to our hotel room in tears.  I went to the room to let her calm down as I returned to the front desk to repot this ignorant woman who has no problem bashing guests starting fights / verbally attacking guests and being (WORDS I AM NOT ALLOWED TO USE PER THE WEB SITE POLICY AND FOR A LACK OF NICER WORDS I CAN‚ÄôT FIND).  The hotel staff took down our complaints and passed me off to 2 other ‚ÄúManagers‚Äù who took down our complaint. One of the ‚ÄúManagers‚Äù has me fill out a written formal complaint and offered to give us what was promised (Thank you for that).  We had been asked by numerous staff how our stay was and we said not great because of: The renovations we can hear them hammer drill drilling concrete through the walls @ 0700 in the morning every day all staff and managers replied with Oh. Not a single person offered to address this concern or even ask the contractors to wait till at least 0900.  We spoke with numerous guests @ the Westgate Hotel Las Vegas & people on our flight back and they all said we should write this review as the Hotel staff did not do everything they could have or should have to help us or remedy this problem. One couple even said you should have gotten way more for their screw ups all around and we would have to agree they did not try very hard.  It left such a bad taste in our mouth on the first say of our adventure that it ruined the whole trip and experience we could not wait to go home (also not allowed to use the words I wanted to due to web site policy) and out of Las Vegas.  I will say on a positive note the staff and food @ Benihana was the best thing we enjoyed and the guests at our table (all of them) said it was a much better hotel under the old owners (Hilton).  We hope this review costs your hotel money because that seems to be the only thing you care about it sure is not customer service.
40,Stayed in a suite room and it was beautiful and accommodating. The only bad thing was that the coffee pot was moldy and the coffee supplied was stale. I called housekeeping and they brought a fresh supply of coffee. We went to a Christmas party in the penthouse suites and it could not have been better. Hopefully they have it there again next year.
50,This band plays the cover songs to a tee!! The main singer had an amazing voice. Never heard anyone sing Whitney Houston song like that ever. Enjoy the vibe they have and how they interact with a band. As a Latin music promoter I highly recommend this band for sure!!!
50,Very friendly awesome service! We attended the happy hour for wine and cheese pairing for owners. Staff made sure to interact and made sure that the customers enjoyed happy hour and that everything was clean.
50,Had an amazing time listening to great music at the International Bar. High Rocktane was amazing! Such a vivacious group playing all types of music to get the crowd jumping. Kara the lead singer did a wonderful job keeping the crowd on the dance floor. I remembered so many of the songs and danced all night long. Thank you for such an entertaining visit. Will definitely visit again!
50,At arrival Mr. Westgate is waiting at the door to welcome you. (Thank you Mr. Westgate). It is a really luxury experience. Rooms completely new resort villas are made with the unique westgate style.
50,We have been fans of the band High Rocktane after seeing them in Laughlin over the last couple of years. we happened to be in Las Vegas last week to visit family and stayed an extra night just to catch High Rocktane at the Westgate Resort! Even though we didn't stay at this hotel the bar and service were very good but the band was amazing as always!  This band is so fun to watch the energy goes on all night! Highly recommend catching their show while at this hotel! Can't wait to see them again!!!
50,Our stay at the Westgate Resort was very nice. Bambi in the VIP Lounge was terrific - she helped us with everything.  The Westgate is a convenient location has all you'll need in-house for your stay and you will leave feeling like you made the right choice.  Thanks again Bambi...
50,Whether you are a local or a tourist this is a band you do not want to miss. They are all so talented. You will definitely find yourself out on the dancefloor singing to some of your favorite songs from the 80s.
50,We stayed here right after Christmas specifically because we are huge Elvis fans. We were lucky enough to meet Amy the woman that runs the hotels social media page. She took us on an epic unofficial Elvis tour..we were in our glory and it was just so otherworldly to be in his dressing room stand where he stood and breathe in the air he used to. We will 100% come back because of this..    I do have to say it is a bit frustrating that you can't even walk to or from your room without because hounded by employees trying to sell you a timeshare. We wanted to look at the pics statue and lobby but sometimes it's hard because they don't leave you alone.
50,This is one of the best groups in las vegas.. they are a must see act..  Very lively and exciting. Playing some of the best music from across all ages.  You can't help but get into the groove and mood with their song selection
50,Blue String Theory is truly a great band. This incredibly talented group of musicians performs classic rock and much more from the 70s 80s and 90s with such energy that you come away feeling mesmerized.
50,Great hotel and staff awesome staff at the spa I would like to thank Jennifer Durham for my spa treatment she was absolutely amazing can't wait to come back and see her again. She was a true professional. Thank you Jennifer
50,My friend and I did a two day getaway to Vegas and we spend the last night having some drinks in the lobby bar. The band high Rocktane was great. They played so many fun songs and we danced and had a really fun night!
50,I hoped to purchase a Manilow shirt as a gift. Maria personally opened the merchandise shop for me to quickly browse and purchase one. Very grateful for the personal touch in her customer service today.
50,We enjoyed our evening during happy hour. Thank you for the friendly and relaxed atmosphere. Aida and Olivia were very hospitable and knowledgeable of the resort amenities and Vegas in general. We will return and look forward to our next visit.
50,Enjoyed the in house service (rm 24-100); Glenda & Armyme were great hosts. They were helpful and polite. Would have loved having bacon & eggs on the menu. I look forward to my next stay at Westgate Resorts.
50,Amazeballs great folks enjoyed my time. Very personable experience they made me feel better about loosing my money and even better when I won it back! Definitely coming back to the west gate for the great experience
40,Mr. Westgate was amazing! He was very helpful upon our arrival even bringing us water since the line was so long. He was also helpful throughout our stay helping with directions to different places in the hotel. Thank you!!
50,"As an owner at Westgate I've always had a great stay (which is how I became an owner there!) They have some of the best people on their staff! Mr. Westgate at the door always looking so dapper and treating you with the best courtesy to my concierge who's always making it a personal connection to give us the best services!  Definitely experience staying! Just the old ""classic Vegas"" history will take you back to a time of glitz and gulch no doubt! Oh and the dining!!    **Did you know the Benihana INSIDE the Westgate is where that Kill Bill scene was actually filmed??? Yeah pretty cool right!!!"
50,Every one of the staff were awesome and made you feel like family as well as royalty or a high roller.. Bought ownership here and love to stay few times a year. Great casino/hotel look forward to going again.
10,I will stay at an Airbnb instead of here. They will up charge you for your room but then you have no microwave or coffee maker. If you have any type of chronic illness or need to eat in your room DONT COME HERE. The staff is unhelpful and doesn‚Äôt care if you starve.
50,We had a great in! It was Lots of fun clean rooms great staff. Bring warm clothing this time of year. Restaurants and conference area great great place to watch a few games and play black Jack. thanks
50,We were treated exceptionally by the in house greeter team in the Westgate Club room. Aida was super welcoming and made us feel right at home. The server in the Fresh Buffet was also great...she was working by herself and still took great care of us. I know I'm spelling her name wrong but it was something like Muie
50,Aida and Olivia in House Greeting Services were the most amazing people ever!!! Aida had conversations with me and always served more wine or offered waters. An amazing soul!! Always made sure I had drinks or offered waters but most of all offered an amazing energy!
50,Lyndia was the best. I got here tired and hungry after traveling all day. Needless to say I wasn't exactly when I got all checked in and finally found my room in the maze of elevators and hallways only to find that it wasn't in acceptable condition. I went back to the front desk where Lyndia helped me. She didn't make me wait in that long line again. She was super friendly and got me another room right away. The new room was very nice and comfortable. She turned what was a frustrating situation into a pleasant one. Thanks Lyndia. I wish you the best of everything!
50,I want personally thank WESTGATE for all they have done we my wife and l truly enjoyed our visit and vacation. We are owners and upon losing all my creditials and you guys found and it returned them. I personally thank FRANCISCO for his steadfast professionalism and help after we were delayed 2 days due to bad weather we paid very minimal for 2 extra days. A lot of times people say they will be thereby WESTGATE WAS...I NEVER expected or experience such service in 30+ years of Naval service and l traveled All over the world...l THANK ALL INVOLVED. The Valet to the front desk was phenomenal...
50,We want to give a BIG SHOUT OUT to Annie G & Adrian of Fortuna Cafe! Always pleasant even at 1am haha! Very personable & upbeat making sure every order is correct. Definitely staying at Westgate the next time we‚Äôre in Las Vegas!
20,Hotel is old (especially bathroom) very disappointed. They didn't clean the room for 3 days (even we called ask & complain to managers!). But they charged very high price because CES conference.  Service was terrible also whenever I asked for any questions or call.
50,We‚Äôve been owners for over 3 decades. L‚ÄôOr√©al and Aida were awesome service people! Their smiles were abundant and they went above and beyond to make sure we were happy! I wish I had people with their enthusiasm and professionalism working for me. They both deserve a raise and promotion!  The Jackson‚Äôs from Chicago.
50,Tyler T at front desk was absolutely fabulous! So far everyone has just been wonderful . Our room is Amazing and the casino and hotel are stunning!  Can't wait to tour the shops and restaurants!  Thank you Tyler T! You made our vacation Wonderful!
50,We attended the Jen Kramer show Dec 30th. What an amazing show! We took our 6 year old and he had a great time! He even got to be part of the show. Highly recommend the show for a family fun experience.
50,Rooms where large with queen size beds with great view of the city . Many slot machines to choose from. Restaurants inside of hotel. You can get a uni rail train right outside of the hotel to take you anywhere in the city . I liked I so much that I bought a time share at this hotel !
50,I liked that this hotel was on the Las Vegas Monorail! The beds and room size were nice. The bathroom shower was wonderful but the bathroom was a little small and probably would have been for 2 plus people.
30,Full day tour of the Grand Canyon was awesome because it included the Hover dam Mojave dessert and the skywalk. Paid 169.00 which included lunch and shuttle pick up Westgate sportsbook entrance side. They also gave us water and a granola bar. Bus driver also gave history as we drove. We were able to stop along the way and take pictures. My email for more questions: academiamasters.org@gmail.com    FedEx business room has good wifi and place for printing which is great!    No scale in the hotel room to weigh suitcases.    The sportsbook offers a bit more opportunity for socialization. More meet and greet happens there.    Casino is clean  clean rooms  Quiet    No microwave was wierd and a sign in the gift shop that said no outside food in microwave was weird also    Westgate owner section is generally closed after hours and so my reservation could not be found although it was booked a month in advance. And the westgate hotel personal had text messaged me to confirm the reservation the morning of travel. Still I had no reservation when I arrived at 11 pm.    Deli is open 24hours in hotel which is great!
40,4 for renovated rooms pleasant housekeeping staff clean facility and stellar customer service by Tyler T at the front desk. Quick response to challenges & helped with last minute requests. Thanks for standing out and going the extra mile to accommodate!
50,Checked in late and was making sure I had the correct elevator üõó and asked Mr. Vince and he went up the lift and showed me the direction of the room. Very caring person appreciated it and even greeted me in lobby later.
50,My spa service from Jennifer at the Westgate Vegas spa was amazing. She tailored my service specifically for me and listened to my needs. I will definitely recommend her for the Serenity body wrap service.
30,When we first arrived a gentleman who appeared to be policing the lobby approached us and told us that we were early the computers or credit card machines were down and besides that we would have to wait until check in time (3:00 p.m.) to check in anyway. I was taken aback! I had never had this experience at the Wynn Hotel or Bellagio before! It was around 12:30 or 12:45 and we were tired. We waited and when the time came we approached the front desk. When it was our turn the Customer Service Representative was very knowledgeable and really nice. We told her about our experience when we first arrived. She was apologetic understanding and really knew how to relate to us as guest. Just because she handled our reservations and took the time with us it made the rest of our experience at the Westgate so much better. I was beginning to think we had made a mistake by booking but because of Mary B's professionalism and dedication to service it overshadowed the negativity that we had first encountered.  This employee is needs to be in management. Thank you Mary B. for your kindness and knowing how to relate to guest.
50,Not going to lie this music is before my time. Parents still play it around me though. Glad to see my folks had a good time and was dancing in their seats. Would super recommend! I wish I had the chance to meet up and thank them for being so awesome!
20,It is a small hotel not big as it posted on the photos. Rooms are fine but nothing to do for kids.  It is close to circus circus hotel. Which is a benefit if you come with a family. Not worth it. ..
50,Totally enjoyed the Soul of Motown concert the best of 2022. If you have not seen their concert at the westgate/ Las Vegas go see it will not let you down. Great music and laughter #soulofmotownwestgtelasvegas
10,So we decided to celebrate our 9th anniversary and wanted to share it with The Westgate in Las Vegas  we were staying 2 nights and 3 days from 12/31/22-1/1/23 and our first room had NO A/C and NO ICE and a view of the the PARKING LOT and TRASH AREA  upon complaint  front desk Brady stated no rooms were available to change for accommodation next morning we go to front desk and are moved to a room with NO WORKING SINK and CLOGGED DRAINS on top of the sink not working properly  when assessing the issue SCALDING HOT WATER BURNED MY LEGS AND FEET definitely will NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN
50,A good hotel to stay. Rooms are super nice and spacious. Housekeeping every day. Staff friendly except the security man with a light beard. Our request was rejected immediately even though it wasn't even a difficult request. He couldn't empathize with the situation at all. Further compliments to Mr Westgate. Super friendly host and always looked very neat like New Year's Eve also Ms Westgate Thank you Mr Westgate for everything.
50,Wonderful place. Very friendly staff. Had the pleasure of meeting an outstanding greeter. Mr Westgate. Very nice and courteous with us and friendly‚Ä¶ very nice and well dressed guy. We had a wonderful time .
50,Their service was outstanding from the time we checked in to our departure Sam at the check in desk help us immensely changing our room after the first night due to the bed and air conditioning not working properly.  Aida L‚ÄôOr√©al and Olivia during the happy hr at the 24th floor were fantastic so helpful and friendly it‚Äôs a real joy to return and see them.  Thank you for a wonderful experience.
50,Mr Westgate the greeter was very helpful on Jan 1. I lost my wallet and I wasn't sure what to do and he directed me to the proper security person and I was able to recover it! This shows the quality of the people working here!
50,The lounge was the best.. Maggie and Aida were amazing.. soo helpful and fun to talk to.. amazing service. The rooms have one of the best views to see the fireworks on new years and the casino is superb
50,Wonderful stay!  Then I had left a few items Butch D was outstanding to help!! It took US a week to get the information that they needed They never Gave up! We got our things just as they said we would!
50,Mr Westgate gave us the most awesome mini tour after running into him at the hotel. He is extremely informed and intelligent! He‚Äôd be perfect for the Elvis tour. Thank you Mr Westgate for an unforgettable experience! :)
50,Vilma Mr. West gate and Thomas were excellent. They gave us the best experience and best customer service. They made the new year one to remember and a great way to enter it. Best way to enter the new year no doubt with their amazing personalities.
50,Excelentes instalaciones personal altamente calificado desde el mismo momento que pisas el hotel la atenci√≥n es de primera muy profesionales atentos amables las habitaciones est√°n super c√≥modas elegantes.    Excellent facilities highly qualified staff from the moment you step foot in the hotel the attention is first class very professional attentive friendly the rooms are super comfortable elegant.
50,Miss Aida Kelsie was greeting us very warmly. She was very entertaining and was very accommodating. Truly a memorable trip due to her presence. Thank you so much for such a great holiday and a fun place to celebrate the new year!
50,tyler at fromt desk was so calm and patient. answered all of our qiestions with a thousand people behind us. great service. this was amazong experience and i will be sure to refer family and friends.
50,The show was a rewarding experience. I really enjoyed Big Sexy and the energy all cast exhibited. My daughter and her friend had never attended a live performance; so they were in awe. I also like the introduction of Motown.
50,Hotel and room were amazing. Customer service also was great especially James from Concierge/Front Desk who guided us during check in process and made our arrival and first impression amazing. Room was renovated and view was great. We would definitely come back in our next visit
50,I‚Äôm absolutely blown away by High Octane. Music is my biggest passion and it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve experienced talent like this. When a rock back can perform Whitney Houston with absolute perfection it‚Äôs a must see!
50,Music was amazing and the show was a lot of fun too! Each artist has exceptional skill and their own personality. The young lady Sean Stewart is beautiful and soulful. Big Sexy brings exceptional talent and some humor to the night. Not to mention sexy moves. The other two artists range and talent were incredible. The show was wonderful and highly recommended!
50,We were checking in to spent one night for my husbands Christmas party and was greeted by Mr. Westgate. What a wonderful personality and perfect person for the job. He is definitely an asset to the Westgate hotel in Las Vegas NV.
50,Honest staff we forget am item and recieved an email stating it had been forgotten. After a shipping fee the item was shipped to our home. We were very pleased with the attention to detail. Thank you Kiasha A. & Lupe (Security Dept.) & Westgate staff.
40,This hotel was the Las Vegas Hilton. My son and I stayed at the Westgate hotel in Las Vegas for two days to attend NFL game. Overall this hotel is a good value. Although off the strip the tram service stops right in front of the hotel and allows you to travel north or south of Las Vegas boulevard to get to the Football Stadium. The hotel has multiple restaurants a huge sports book and medium size casino. We stayed in a two bed room that had renovated bathroom with large TV and fridge and in room safe. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend people to stay there. Good value choice. Kudos to the Italian Restaurant staff.
40,"Comfortable spacious room. Recycling - even of aluminum cans - was nowhere to be found which was disappointing. Finding that there are NO coffee makers or microwaves in the rooms was also disappointing. It's smart to bring a small coffee maker or immersion heater and instant coffee! Talented bands perform nightly just off the lobby. There were some maintenance issues which should have been addressed prior to my arrival but these were promptly remedied (heat in the room stopped working the sink was missing its stopper and some lights weren't working). Room 2521 has a beautiful view of the clear blue sky the golf course across the street and the mountains in the distance. Room was overall very clean and nicely decorated and furnished. The bench at the foot of the bed was in need of a thorough scrubbing. Monorail stop is adjacent to the hotel and it takes you to the back entryways of many resorts on the strip. The monorail was convenient for those that don't mind navigating the long walk through resorts to get to the Strip (I took the monorail to the Paris stop and walked through that beautiful resort then followed the crowds to cross the street to watch the free fountain show at the Bellagio - not to be missed!). Taxis to and from the Westgate to the airport charge a flat rate of $29. Lyft and Uber are available via the back door accessed via the Sports Book area. Many drivers do not wear or carry masks so it's wise to bring one with you to provide to your driver if you'd like he/she to wear one.  I wish Westgate had more ""grab and go"" options for healthy salads and sandwiches. I was there for 6 days and got tired of  the limited options at the Starbucks/ Fortuna place. Every area should have clearly marked recycling and trash containers. Westgate should also considering a food waste composting program as is required in San Mateo county CA. The resulting compost could help local gardeners and landscaped areas retain water."
50,My girlfriend and I took a trip to the Westgate hotel during our December vacation to Las Vegas. She was interested after seeing the movie Elvis. After many trips to Vegas this was our first time ever in the Westgate. It was not disappointing. The gaming floor is smaller than the majority of the casinos on the strip but adequate enough to hit your gaming fix. What really made our experience great were the employees. Johnny Norallus Jackie Smith Martha Crawford and Arneta Zeibe in the table games department made our experience stand out from our other stops this visit. Enough that we wanted to make sure they got their due credit. Even after I spilled water on our blackjack table these folks maintained a welcoming demeanor and kept the good times going as if nothing happened. I really appreciated that. Some places we have visited recently seem to have forgotten the meaning of the word ‚Äúhospitality.‚Äù Not at the Westgate though. We definitely will be going back and are even considering staying there.
20,Arrival was very difficult to find the front desk for check in. There were two guest services desks  followed by a welcome desk ; all with 2+ associates working at them and they were very scripted with their questions: are you owners or guests ? Then we checked In finally with no direction on which elevators to take to our room ‚Ä¶. The room itself was outdated water leaks constantly and to top the cake add bed bugs and a near midnight room switch to the stay. Ahhhhh by far our worst Westgate stay ever . And we are frequent at the Westgates in the southeast US .
50,If your looking for somewhere to watch the NFR during December this is the place!! We went to several watch parties while in Vegas and Skip Ransoms was great! Highly recommend hitting up this watch party.
50,This property is great! The layout the restaurants (including their famous steak house) Gaming floor I was just impressed all around. We used part of their convention area for our events. The food they served us was really good as well.
50,So much fun to have the live music and fun and be able to watch the rodeo. Fabulous event!!! This was our first time at the hotel but are already planning a return trip. Looking forward to more great events like the one fore the rodeo finals!! !!!
50,Great place to watch the nfr short distance from cowboy christmas comfortable rooms great wait staff. We stayed there for the first week of the nfr they gave us a strip view hotel high enough up that i could see the strip. the rooms were roomy and comfortable. i could sit in the lobby at the bar and it‚Äôs a perfect place to people watch
50,We had a fantastic time. This was our first stay at Westgate. We were so impressed by the hotel amenities and especially the evening entertainment and NFR viewing parties. We only left the hotel to shop at the Cowboy Christmas which was conveniently located at the next monorail stop.    The room was perfect with a full kitchen jacuzzi tub and very comfortable king bed. We dined at the coffee shop steak house and Italian restaurant. All were delicious. I especially loved the chocolate covered apples at the coffee shop.
50,We were there 12/06-12/09 specifically for the NFR watch party and music. It was INSANELY fun and ran so incredibly well. The organizers were so sweet and helpful. 10/10. I will absolutely be returning next year simply because of the organizers of the event.
50,We always like to stay at the Westgate because it feels like home. This year the added benefit was an amazing watch party that was put on by Espuela productions! It was top notch! Being able to enjoy everything the NFR had to offer in one place with good music and great drink specials made the experience even better! CANNOT wait till next year!!!
50,I had the privilege and honor of meeting Mr. Westgate the other evening! He is so kind gracious and hilarious!!! We were laughing so hard we could barely take a picture! He is such a blessing and made my night!
50,I have played table games all over the world. Of course Vegas is and will always be Vegas. I have played at most of the major Casinos in Vegas. I have never taken the time to write a review for someone or an establishment but after my last experience I felt like people should realize what they are missing. That is the WESTGATE! place is being revamped reloaded and the people that work truly understand what it takes to get people to come back and make this their regular place. I want to commend a specific person that was professional kind and accommodating. Now stay with me because I had to write it down her name was Sladana Radonic. She is the Pit Boss in the Table games at the WESTGATE. There was an issue and she was very professional in correcting my mistakes and treated me with respect. What a valuable employee what an asset to WESTGATE.
10,Do not have anything to do with their resort vacation club.!!! We stayed in one of their packages that required you to attend a sales meeting. We stayed and listened the entire time. After the meeting they gave us a receipt for $100 gift for attending to be applied to our credit cards. This never happened. We called and we‚Äôre told it‚Äôs only $50 and that we didn‚Äôt qualify because we had ‚Äúgroup travel‚Äù. Some people we know traveled there from Boise ID. We traveled there from Yuma AZ. Yes- we‚Äôre friends but they put us in a sales group together. They knew that when they gave us the voucher for the $100.  They also told us it was a 90 minute presentation and it took 3 hours of our time.  This is a scam- they also put you on hold when you call and then hang up - 3 times. Disgusting business practices. Run from them!
40,Very upset there was no coffee machine or microwave.  There was no heater on my room but maintenance fixed it next day.  Other than that the front desk Dominik was extremely helpful since arrival. He helped me with my reservation and was very professional.
50,The overall experience and entertainment offered makes for a great visit. The greeter Grace was very welcoming and helped us with directions and was amazing overall. This is a wonderful experience within the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas looking forward to returning.
50,A lot of dealers are impatient and rude but these guys here ‚Ä¶ Ed Shawn Ash and Hulwere patient as I learned the game and Jeromy the put boss was patient when I spilled my drink. All I‚Äôm saying is these dealers are cool and patient as I learned the game. Thanks guys!!! I had a blast!
50,The manilon gift shop was closed and she opened it for us she did us a great favor. We were very confused and she helped us without hesitation. she was very pleasant to work with. Service with a smile.
50,Was very helpful personable and knowledgeable. Very grateful he took the time to show me around and was a knowledge of information. I wouldn't ever think of staying off the strip but westgate is worth it especially with the sports book.
50,I come here every year for my birthday they have a lot to offer great rooms and the staff is so helpful and kind. Specifically Jimmy the front door concierge helped me locate the taxi I left my phone in. He went above and beyond to help me and luckily found my phone in a few minutes.
50,Blue String Theory ROCKS the house!!! The lead singer is super hot!!! These guys have never put on a bad show. The energy they bring to each and every performance makes us want to see them even more frequently. The infectious spirit of the band inspires people of all ages to enjoy the dance floor.
50,Lisa Scott was amazing in helping us set up our sports book app and was very professional. She was very helpful and made sure we knew how to get our bonus. It's great that there are still people like Lisa in the world and we need more people like her.
40,The flight to Vegas was very inexpensive on Air Canada Vacations. The Hotel realy a group of time share 2 bedroom suites the rooms were very posh and they had coffee machines Kurig wih a good selection of beverages. I basically booked this 1 week holiday to volenter at Shiner's Childrens PGA Gof Tournament. The suites were made up every day nd any goods used refilled. WARNING liquor very pricey. All units non smoking . The only negative thing was the constant approaches to go to a presentation of several new proprties in area. Overall very comfortable nd modern.
50,This place is seriously amazing! Deondre and Jose/Mr. Westgate took care of us so well for my partner‚Äôs birthday weekend as did the maintenance and housekeeping workers!    We visited from LA and only stayed for one night because I booked on hotwire to find a cheap hotel during a convention (we didn‚Äôt attend the convention) and were planning on switching to a hotel on the strip for the rest of our stay.    We wished we stayed longer and will definitely be back!! The hotel smelled so good as soon as we walked in and Deondre upgraded our room for my partner‚Äôs birthday. The room was so prettyüòç We had issues with the heat not working but I texted the room service people and they came so quickly to fix it!    The fact that you just text them if you need anything and they respond instantly is reason in itself to book here. It truly felt like a 5 star hotel. The service was incredible.    For refrence I‚Äôve stayed at the flamingo waldorf astoria bally‚Äôs tropicana oyo and ex calibur but the Westgate was definitely up there service-wise with the Waldorf.    Love love love and can‚Äôt wait to return! Thank y‚Äôall!!
50,We stayed at Westgate resorts Las Vegas for 7 days. Our family had a very good time. People are very friendly and accommodating. It has a hospitality area and we are frequent costumers. Aida/Angelik are especially warm friendly and accommodating making people like in their own home. Thanks Aida/Angelik and others.
50,We visited the Westgate Resort and casino so that my husband and his father could meet for the first time. We loved the rooms. We were able to get a conjoined room with a living room area in the middle so that we could talk and get to know each other.  We all wanted to catch a show while in Vegas and after being scammed by Sapphire resorts timeshare for tickets Jenna Hunter from the WOW Rewards Program and Chuck Palermo from the slots and casino area really went above and beyond to make sure that we could all see one. They even called the number on the tickets for us to see what I had been given and where it was located.  Jenna and Chuck generously gave us a great deal to watch the show here at this casino. We really appreciated their kind generosity and professionalism.  After the show we were also able to secure reservations at Benihana even though it showed sold out online.  The staff here really know how to give great customer service.  I plan to come back to Vegas and stay at the Westgate again as it now holds so many wonderful memories. Thank you to everyone for making this first meet and greet one to remember!
50,We stay at The Westgate every December while attending the National Finals Rodeo and another private event. The rooms are comfortable and quiet and the staff is always friendly and accommodating. The greeter Mr. Westgate was especially friendly and helpful.
50,I've attended several concerts at the international theater at the Westgate Casino everyone there is always so friendly & welcoming. Such an intimate setting. If you're in Vegas go see Barry Manilow
50,If you book a stay at the Westgate you need to visit the Serenity Spa. I highly recommend a Massage or Signature Treatment (coconut body scrub) with Jennifer Durham. I also recommend you book a Brightening Facial or Hydrofacial with Chantelle.    This last time I visited I did the 50 minute Himalayan Salt Stone Massage. I added on the aromatherapy journey and coco scrub foot treatment (so worth it!) Jennifer has the magic touch. She found all my knots and massaged them away. I didn‚Äôt have to direct her at all she knew exactly what my body needed. You can tell she really cares about you and wants you to have the best experience.    I also booked a brightening facial with Chantelle. She is such a great aesthetician. I hate extractions but she is able to get the yuck out of your face without any pain. (Well almost no pain lol) After seeing her I feel so beautiful and confident. My face has never looked better.    The rest of staff is also super friendly and the facilities are both relaxing and clean. Book your appointment today you won‚Äôt be disappointed!    Thank you Serenity Spa Team! Xo
40,I stay here almost every year for my employer‚Äôs Christmas party and it‚Äôs a nice staycation. This year we hit some bumps during our stay but the hotel staff did their best to ensure we had a pleasant time. The manager Brady upgraded us to a suite when a leak was found in our room which we were very thankful for! When being moved to our new room Vonda made sure we were taken care of and gave us a late check out since the move interrupted our evening plans. These folks really do care about their guests. Looking forward to next year!
40,I posted a review several years ago and the experience was just not good.    I've returned for another work related event and have to say that they have made some improvements in the rooms.    The bed was comfortable and the room was clean.    The fridge looks like an afterthought just hanging by itself along the wall but it was clean and served it's purpose.    The desk needs some work. The view was amazing but there are no plugs anywhere on it or below it along the wall for laptops/phone/tablet etc.    There are also no plugs at the bedside tables for your phone or tablet.    The bathroom was nice and clean but the shower head in my room was loose off the wall.    I'm going to say 4 stars rating (I gave them 1 last time) because the room was still comfortable to stay in and even more the staff I had contact with at check in the bar and house keeping were very nice and pleasant and a that is a hard thing to find nowadays.
50,Excellent show! The staff member John Peer was so helpful getting us into show. I would highly reccomend. Barry puts on such a great show. It definatly put us in the christmas mood/ season.    Make sure you see him when he returns to the Westgate in February 2023.    Jeff
50,Juana was extremely helpful! I had an amazing experience because of her. The performance was amazing and the hospitality was great! Everyone was super nice and made the experience totally worthwhile.
50,Rudi de Leon he was so pleasant and excellent for his job. We came to the show late thanks to the traffic in front of the hotel but with Rudi de Leon We will be back bec of his gesture of showing kindness.
50,First time at this resort/casino‚Ä¶ Outstanding food service and facilities ‚Ä¶.  I especially that it was quite unique because I was greeted by Mr. Greeter and always counted on him to provide me with various stellar options in the resort/casino‚Ä¶. I will be highly recommending the Westgate to friends and family and will tell them to make sure to visit Mr. Greeter‚Äôs greeting area‚Ä¶.  See you soon Mr. Greeter and Westgate staff!!!
50,I normally wouldn‚Äôt leave a review because I‚Äôm a Las Vegas local however we were enjoying the nfr experience and wanted to eat after. Benihana was closed and we asked for some help from Tim to find a restaurant. Usually someone would point and say maybe try there but he walked us around until we found somewhere to eat! He made me believe in Vegas hospitality again: he even came and found us after to make sure our food was good. He made our night! Thank you Tim!
50,Tim honestly made us believe in Vegas again. He was genuine and considerate it. He took the time to walk with us to find a place to eat after the other restaurants were closed. His hospitality was top notch and even checked on how we enjoyed the meal.
40,I had never stayed at this hotel before (formerly the Las Vegas Hilton if I remember correctly) but it was a pleasant surprise. We were staying elsewhere for an event the night before with group pricing and that pricing went away for Saturday so I ended up trying a few things and then getting a smoking hot deal on Hotwire and it turned out to be the Westgate. There were plenty of people there for the national rodeo event as well as the Chargers/Raiders game but it wasn't overcrowded. Our rooms had some age on them (likely this place was last redone in the 90's?) but they were big. Beds weren't the most forgiving but not uncomfortable. Parking is not connected to the main building so there is a bit of a hike on the way in and out. I was certainly happy overall and it didn't hurt that we got a good deal on the room and one of our group hit it big at the craps table and bought us all dinner. I would be willing to come back again.
10,I was very disappointed in this hotel. We were told it would be an extra $20 to check in early on arrival day. Turns out that was charged per day. You could hear every word of those walking down the hall and in the adjoining room. I know more about the life of those in the adjoining room than I care to. The bed sheets had to be changed because they were soiled or stained (towels too). The objective was to be close to the convention center but meetings were 2/3 mile away. Wi-Fi was off and on despite another ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù to cover that. We were told there was maid service but no one even changed the trash in three days and we were told to call down daily if we wanted that.    The positive was there was a great rain shower and nice desk in the renovated room. Monorail was close by.    Too many choices in Vegas for me to want to stay here.
50,Jimmy the bellhop/parking attendant was amazing! We had a situation with a driver and he took care of us and called a replacement ride immediately making sure that we were both safe. We really appreciated the compassion he showed.
10,Absolutely the worst hotel I‚Äôve been to. No desk. Probably not a big deal except I was here for a conference and they charged me to get into my room early to ‚Äúwork‚Äù. My room was disgusting- like for real worse than a 1 star quality inn. Strange tiny inchworm on my bed crumbs so big I could have reassembled the cookie for a late night snack. Human hair in my shower. Outlets too far away to charge a phone by the bed. I‚Äôm 5 foot 6 and I guess I was supposed to sit in the shower- in between the hot and cold water because the head of the shower was never actually mounted. And it was positioned at a great spot for a tiny child. There‚Äôs a ‚Äúspa‚Äù near the elevator and every time I tried to get to my room I was hassled for eye cream (rude) or to sit through a time share sale. No restaurants are open for lunch except for one with 2 waitresses and the wait is long. The others are only open from 5-9:30 for dinner but no reservation- no luck. Your only option becomes the sports book area. The NY style pizza is actually wood fired. Not bad- but not NY. No decent wine at the 2 bars here. Never ever. I would stay at a hourly motel over this.
50,The ladies are so friendly and helpful. Love this extra perk. Great selection of snacks and beverages. Happy hour offers a great selection of wine and beer. We enjoy meeting other owners when we are here. Nice quiet area to relax in with two tv‚Äôs.
50,This post is to commend the professionalism and hospitality of the West Gate staff. I received excellent service from the West Gate Fresh Buffet. The manager Cheryl was friendly courteous and professional. Her and her team went out of their way to meet our needs and to make our party feel valued as guest. My great experience here continued as I went out front to catch a cab. While waiting for a taxi I observed Jimmy interact with a challenging customer who was idling in the traffic lane. I was completely blown away by his professionalism and courtesy as he addressed the situation. This team should be commended for representing Westgate‚Äôs brand so well. I will be back!
40,The Westgate is located off strip but for a business conference it was more than sufficient. The Edge restaurant located inside the hotel was fantastic fine dining. The casino was sufficient. Updated machines and lower cost tables. The Westgate isn‚Äôt my top choice for a family our couple trip but for a business trip it was all I needed!
30,The room is mediocre at best. Inconsistent checkin. Four checking in I think 10 min in total with all booked at same tim . One receives one bedroom suite. One of receives room with bar and kitchenette. And two of us receive non draining showers elevators that won‚Äôt stop on our floors et. Terrible guest service
50,I had the opportunity to use the spa at Westgate to get a pedicure and manicure. I had the best Nail Tech LuLu Cooper!! She made me feel so welcome and went above and beyond to make me feel special.
50,I visit westgate IBar or International Bar and there bartenders are so kind and cool‚Ä¶ they are easy to approach. First time i go there and i meet the bartender that is so charming the smile is good and can make your problem away.  Will be back again.
10,So far I haven‚Äôt even been able to get into my room. After waiting in line for 45 minutes they tried an upsell for $25 a night OR wait for several more hours while they clean rooms.    There was a greeter at the start of the line that could have told people they were going to try and gouge you and you got to wait 45 minutes then you‚Äôll have to come back later if you don‚Äôt want to get gouged.    They tried to tell me the extra was for a renovated room. Pretty sure when I book that was what I already picked.    Just go check you bags at the bell desk I was told. Well finally after 15 minutes someone showed up. He was a friendly guy.    So as I sit here trying to figure the bait and switch or extortion I figure (before I even get me room) I should have stayed somewhere else or anywhere else.
50,Two words: Tyler Tilev. Tyler takes customer service to a new art form. He‚Äôs patient kind & makes every guest feel like they are VIPs.  This was my first business trip after a year-long battle with cancer and Tyler made every moment memorable.
50,Maria Cline was one of the most pleasant and helpful greeters I have ever met. She was so helpful to us and made us feel like Family. Can‚Äôt thank her enough for that special touch of kindness. We talked for just a shot while and she had me pegged as a Leo right off the bat. Great people skills.
50,We were greeted by Mr. Westgate who was so lovely from the moment locked eyes. He made us feel so comfortable welcomed and taught us so much about the history of the hotel. He was so polite and informative - we were truely grateful to have him greet and take us on a little tour.
50,We were greeted by Mr. Westgatein-house greeter on Sunday November 27th around 3-3:30 and we immediately fell in love with him. We went to our room and then when we realized we had an issue with our ‚ÄúSoul of Motown‚Äù tickets we went back to him. He was so so helpful and he found resolution to our problem. He was a life saver! We would certainly come back here because of him!!!
10,This hotel should have one star. Reasons :  Main strip is about hour hour walk away  No coffee station in the room  No shows in the hotel  No concierge service  Small washroom  Loose water tap. Always running  No proper lighting in the room  No water bottles in room
50,It was the greatest the staff was very nice and a lady named Maria cliene was supper nice and friendly and make sure we had everything we needed and gave us tips on places to go we enjoy her knowledge
50,Maria and Aida were always super sweet attentive and extra nice. They always made us feel welcome and were always friendly and helpful. Kuddos to them. They made our thanksgiving away from home very cozy. We had a great time at the lounge. Thank you
50,We travelled from Los Angeles just to watch Blue String Theory. We‚Äôve seen them last before the pandemic and since then we became an avid fan. They‚Äôre so great and that we had to make sure to include them as part of our Family vacation. The singer is absolutely great and super friendly. He played the medley of our favorite 80‚Äôs band - Duran Duran. Thank you Blue String Theory for making our vacation indeed for the books. Wish you all the best!!!! More power and the greatest blessings.
50,The band Blue String Theory was fantastic when they performed on Friday night! Definitely stick around because they played incredible Classic Rock hits! You‚Äôll love them and they are extremely friendly everyone was out there dancing!
50,A class band have a great time as always every Friday night they take the music to new highs and everyone. Fun to watch how the band interacts with fans and each other I would recommend this to anyone
50,Our trip is in the early phase but it's important to start it off well. Alberto's friendly service and great personality is a great help. He's very cordial and kind. They hotel is an excellent value for the price.
50,5 Stars for Deondre working the Key pickup on 11-25-2022. He single handedly made our stay at this hotel worthwhile with his customer service.    My wife and I was Originally checked into a completely outdated room on the 28th floor by Jax in the VIP check in. Getting placed in that room PLUS the constant nagging about time share really made us displeased with this hotel.
50,Very attentive pleasant host and Greeter. Greet us with a big smile smile and answered all the questions we had. Couldn't be named best. Mr. Westgate. AWESOME Personality and Human being. Keep doing the Good work .
50,On 11/26/22 we celebrate our fathers 100th birthday. This person is super special to many people not just his family so we wanted to have a special celebration and show him how much we cared and loved him. The banquet and catering staff led by KEN RATIGAN were amazing. They made us feel so special and made our event come off without any problems whatsoever. We were expecting gold and were given diamond service. I cannot say enough good things about Ken and his staff. They went above and beyond what we had originally decided to do both in price value and services. We stayed in the Hotel for a week with family coming in from europe back east south America and throughout the states the majority staying at westgate. They all had great things to say about their rooms the restaurants and the service. I can continue to ramble but I think you get the point.
50,Lulu Copper provided wonderful service at the Serenity Spa Nail Shop. She was early and was delicate with my nails. I appreciated the conversation and the neatness of my nails. Best Service Ever!!!!!!!!
50,Westgate hotel was so clean and fresh to the point we asked if it was a brand new hotel to find out its been here for years even elvis had played in it. All the staff was so welcoming The greeter Mr westgate was amazing and helpful. He would do anything for you.
50,Went to the Westgate Friday night to enjoy time out with some friends. Ended up going to grab some drinks and saw Rock Roulette playing by the bar. Loved the energy and had a lot of fun. Will definitely be returning.
20,Need realistic pictures of rooms! I expected the darkness but the room was very dated. Like an actual extension cord to plug items in. The bathroom shower hinge was off! For the price we paid (500 for 2 nights) it felt like we were at a Motel! The price did not match what we actually got. Will Never stay here again.
50,I went here with my friends for the weekend and we ended up getting lost IN THE HOTEL because we are dumb! Kelly Fogerty rescued us multiple times and guided us to food and safety. We love you Kelly‚ù§Ô∏è
50,Have heard about this band and finally got a chance to see them with my sister at the Westgate lounge. I wanted to see them live because the band won a major award for best band and is nominated again this year.    Let me tell you the hype is real. This band is fantastic and really gets the crowd involved. The singer is tremendous and the band are all fantastic. We will come back again for sure.
50,Saw an excellent band called Hi Rocktane in the Westgate lounge. What a band and what a show! It was not stop hits dancing and singing along to favorites. The band was gracious enough to pose for a pic with me and my friends during the break.
50,Cesar my casino host treated us greathe always was able to help us enjoy our stay.our hotel stay was wonderful. We got to see a concert Elton John. This was once in a lifetime for us.the bus ride to concert was great to also the box seats and food we're out of this world to us.
50,Highest honors for Frankie I'm Sid's Cafe. She gave above and beyond service. We kept going back because we felt that she cared and remembered all of our likes and details. You should look for more servers like this.
50,My husband and I always stay at the Westgate in Las Vegas because we prefer a hotel that is on the strip and not super expensive.    The Westgate is small by comparison to other hotels. That may not be for everyone but I love that I don‚Äôt need a map to navigate the hotel and because it doesn‚Äôt have a ton of shops it is not overly crowded. The rooms are clean & comfortable. The staff it always friendly & helpful.    The monorail is very easy to access which is a huge plus because it is just steps to get to and head to the rest of the strip. They also have a great diner (Sid‚Äôs) and some very nice restaurants.    Definitely a great place for folks who love Vegas but don‚Äôt want to spend a fortune to be on the strip.
50,The Westgate ain‚Äôt much but Kayleigh improved the stay by 10000%. If you are at the hotel - book a massage with her. If you are on the strip somewhere else - take the monorail down and go see her.Now.
50,The place was nice and my stay was very comfortable. Mr.Westgste (Jose) in the lobby was Awesome! He met us with a smile every day & was super helpful with suggestons and info. I would book again based on him alone.
50,When I fist arrived to the Westgate Kelsie who works in in-house greeting was an absolute gem. 1000/10 all around. She was so friendly and sooooo sweet. I would return just based off of how genuine she treats guests alone. While we were there we worked with Nuvia Alvizo who works in the gifting department. She too was so sweet and kind. Both ladies provided amazing customer service and treated myself as well as every other guest I saw them interact with with such care. They were easy to talk to and made asking questions easy and were very informative as well. Their friendliness alone makes the experience so great. Awesome job ladies. Keep up the great work. :)
50,If you ever book a ride thru Westgate transportation department thru your host request Luis Urbina! I went to Vegas solo many times & he was always professional very funny told the best stories & I felt very safe in his care! He was very knowledgeable of the area attractions & recommended many areas of interest I had asked about. He is very personable too! Westgate is lucky to have him care for their VIPs!! Make sure to tip the drivers well as its a service industry!
50,Although not advertised as an official tour due to timing difficulties we reached out to the Westgate to see if we could tour anything Elvis related. Amy Davis reached back out to us and offered us a personal tour of all things Elvis. Amy went above and beyond taking her time explaining things and showing us everything. Fantastic experience and I'd definitely recommend reaching out for a tour. Although there isn't much left from when Elvis was there I was beyond thrilled to see what little they have left. I sure hope they keep it in the future and try to create an Elvis exhibit/official tour. A special thank you to Amy again for an unforgettable experience.
50,They‚Äôre Super Cool üòé from lead singer Brian to base and lead guitar üé∏ the drummer and keyboard are all Awesome üëè they rock!! Very entertaining & friendly. Once you hear them play you‚Äôll come back!
50,I really enjoyed the band that played last Friday Blue String Theory.they sounded like the music they played and they were so much funwith them playing with the crowd.The drinks were reasonable and good. My friends and I enjoyed ourselves.
50,"We had the time of our lives at Bronx Wanderers concert 11/13 !! We had wonderful seats & the show was totally awesome! My husband was raised in NJ & hailed frm Bronx in his glory youth....the show was like ""memory lane"" with songs costumes & many glorious memories that made him feel young again. I reccomend the show to anyone who wants to hear a great band - alive with lots of energy - GO SEE BRONX WANDERERS!!!!    Westgate is a great casino....very clean & has much to do for everyone. I reccomend any room....very nice."
50,"I love everything about the Westgate from the Greeter at Checkin to the Bartenders at the ""I"" Bar  the servers at the Restaurants and the gambling but hands down is the live Music    Such a group of talented musicians................ Be there again in December :) AWESOME with HIGH ENERGY!!!!"
40,Aida an in house greeter in the owners lounge was wonderful. It is nice to get some perks while traveling. The casino machines were not very good to me but I went not expecting to win. The rooms were clean and spacious No microwave but we did have a refrigerator average hotel noise all hours of the day. Bring your own coffee pot if you don't want to spend $6 on a cup of coffee. Great get away and would recommend this property just remember they will try to sell you a timeshare you can say no.
50,Blue String Theory on Fridays is a must!! Great songs talented musicians and a welcoming fan base that will make you want to dance!!!! Plus the band is the greatest guys you will ever meet! They interact with you and love having their pictures taken with you making it a memorable night there!!
30,We get an excellent tour of Elvis's story at Westgate (Before the International Hotel) all that he explain to us was very interesting.  This gentleman takes us to all the important points where we could find pictures places and stories about how he was in the time he stay and presents in the hotel.  Thank you again for your help.
50,Went to Westgate to see my favorite band Blue String Theory. They bring the party. My guy and I love coming out to Vegas just to see them and we love when they play at Westgate. This venue allows them to show their stuff in a more intimate setting. AWESOME BAND GREAT VENUE!
50,Westgate is awsome! I especially loved dancing and singing along with all my favorite 80's songs with Blue String Theory! They are a truly amazing talented group of guys. The lead singer Brian really interacts with the crowd and made the show so much fun! You rock Brian!
50,Hotel was very clean and the machines paid out great! Big bonus was a band named Blue String Theory FANTASTIC! Lead singer Brian was very entertaining and made our group feel special. Will definitely be back for more Westgate and BST!!
50,Loved being away from the busier part of the strip the accommodations for the Tejano convention. Loved the easy access of the monorail and enjoyed the in house entertainment of Blue String Theory! The lead singer entertained and engaged with the crowd bringing back to back hits and energy. Only down side was when we had convention at the Rio we had music until 2am in the lobby bar area and a nightclub for after parties non of this kept the party going for our crowd that would expect Vegas to entertain past 12am.
50,This is the most underrated band in Vegas! They are very engaged with audience and always put on a kickass show. I have seen them now over a dozen times and each time is better than the last! Don‚Äôt miss them!
50,Great band playing in the lounge!!  BLUE STRING THEORY!!!  Loved all the songs!! I had a blast dancing!  The lead singer Brian makes you feel like you are apart of the show!! Great frontman!!  Love the Sportsbook!! Its huge!! Always a great time at the Westgate!!
50,I had the privilege of seeing Blue String Theory at the I-bar lounge. They were incredible! By far they are the most fun and friendly group I've seen in Las Vegas! Please keep them under contract Westgate!!!
50,Barry Manilow did not disapppoint! We enjoyed listening to his music while singing along. Barry connects with his audience and is a great showman! Great show and wonderful venue. Thanks to usher Carolyn who moved us up to the fourth row just as the show started. What a fun experience!
50,Stayed for a Convention and have to say what a great time it was. Rooms were beautiful food offerings delicious and gift shops had great selection. For me being a huuuge Elvis fan as well it was an incredible feeling staying here. The history of this building is just amazing and I hope that its preserved for many years to come. Seeing his statue in the Lobby and the International Showroom in the Casino is very surreal. I also loved how easy I felt it was to get around on the property. So many of the large casinos I get lost constantly but here..I felt right at home! We will definitely be back to the Westgate and ill encourage anyone we know to do the same and choose you for their stay in beautiful Las Vegas!
50,Love Westgate and all it offers!  The new Marketplace is my favorite coffee crepes!  Soul of Motown was awesome and the best show in Vegas!  Staff was always courteous and friendly.  Enjoyed the slots and WOW rewards too!
50,We stayed at the Westgate Lad Begad Resort and Casino in May 2022 returned November 2022. Absolutely love Mr Westgate the Greeter‚Ä¶ his charm charisma energy and wardrobe! He so deserves to be ‚ÄúMr. Westgate‚Äù. What a tribute to him and huge bonus to Westgate to have such a fabulous staff member!
50,i had Jennifer for an aromatherapy massage and it was out of this world! so relaxing and peaceful she was very gentle yet firm and the hot rocks were the cherry on top. highly recommend !!! would definitely return to this spa.
50,Went to WG to hang w/friends. Wow - what a band you having playing in your lounge (why the heck are they in a lounge??)!!! Amazing talent - and the singer‚Ä¶what a range and SOO personable!!! I‚Äôm shocked and loving it!!!  -Marissa
50,My husband and I saw Barry Manilow at Westgate tonight. His music never gets old....and apparently Barry doesn't either! He blew the doors off the place! All the old hits and the finale was AMAZING! The man is a living legend. We feel so lucky to have seen such an incredible show.    Special thanks to Adriene Luther for upgrading our seats to the VIP section. It was wonderful and made us feel really welcome.    I will also add that your casino has the NICEST staff. Everyone was friendly welcoming and kind. We haven't had that experience anywhere else in Vegas and if we return we will definitely stay there.
50,Band was great.... Enjoyed the Ibar... Blue String Theory really does great. Must see this band. Hotel is great as well..great food. Rooms were nice. If your are in vegas this is the place to be. Great prices
50,My husband and I went to the Barry Manilow concert last night and it was awesome! The hospitality staff was wonderful! Mark with security went out of his way to talk with us he was so friendly! Henry the photographer made us laugh! The concert was amazing and the staff made the evening extra special. We will definitely come back! Thank you
50,Although I am an owner at one of Westgate's Resorts this was the first time that we stayed at the hotel & Casino. Our room was spectacular and roomy. The view of the area was awesome. The staff at Westgate was very professional and friendly. This was a very nice stay.
50,It was all good From check-in to departure. The house greeters Aida Kelsie Armynne & Angelick was commendable for their untiring service and help. Our usher Samantha was also a big help for her welcoming advice and helpful tour of the hotels elevators wings gates and the owners club. We are definitely coming back.
50,Every time I stay at Westgate this hotels gets better 1st stayed here in 2012 and it was on its last legs hardly the story now. Thank you hotels feels loved just need the elevators updated. Love the restaurants and sports book.
40,Overall experience was very good but I must give a extra big call out to Mary A at the front desk  she was extremely helpful  courteous and friendly . I own a Motel in Australia and I would give her a job anytime  Thankyou Mary Aüëå
50,This is why we come back every year  November 2022  Another great stay at the Westgate. We book 50 rooms and a penthouse suite. The staff was more than welcoming to everyone in our group. Special call out to Jimmy the doorman always gracious and attentive. Sherrel in VIP organized and handled lost keys with a smile to everyone. She took great care with our VIP guests. Shannon and her team took care of our parties without a hitch. Sergio The bellman is old school customer service he was tasked to help me carry my back drops. I was not ready when he showed up so he broke them down and helped me pack them. I did not ask for the help he is attentive enough to know when a guest needs it. Carmen worked flawlessly with my assistant to ensure all the guests were taken care of. Thanks again Westgate - you make my job easier.  Read less
40,Jimmy the door man is on top of customer service and taking control of cabs. Look for Jimmy at the Westgate he will make things happen for you. He didn‚Äôt help me and my wife once but twice on a very busy week at the Westgate.    As far as the Westgate all was good except the workout room shouldn‚Äôt open so late 7am. 6am would be more appropriate for business people being meetings typically start at 8am. Opening at 7am cuts workouts short.
50,Great weekend! Shows food massage the sports book! The level of customer service was delightful surprise. It started with Sherell at check in amazingly quick friendly and professional and it never stopped every bartender waiter entertainer cleaning person valet and bellman brought their A game. What a great stay!
50,Mr.Westgate was absolutely FABULOUS! He went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our Elvis experience! He made sure we were able to experience any Elvis memorabilia left here at the Westgate. I highly recommend!
50,We were visiting for a girls trip and wanted to see where Elvis had his residency so we walked in the door and Mr Westgate greeted us happily. We asked if there was an exhibit and took us around showed us all the Elvis things.He was amazing! So gracious üíñ
20,This Hotel is stuck in the late 70‚Äôs early 80‚Äôs. Rooms are out dated silicone around the tub and fixture‚Äôs are peeling up with black mold on them. The lamp switch is on the cord which is just looped up around light bulbs so that it‚Äôs not hanging hidden behind the nightstand. The only plug outlets are on the floor and the was only 1 that was available to use without unplugging something. There were 0 USB ports. No coffee maker daily room service only showed up 50% of the time. It‚Äôs just old and needs to modernize. I stayed 3 nights. $1000 plus an $800 resort fee! Highway robbery!
50,Jimmy the Door Man was excellent in accommodating our group!  Mr. Westgate was amazing working with Janet and Kim to seat our large group in a private dining room in Sid's Cafe!    Everyone at the Westgate Las Vegas loves their jobs and it shows!  They admire and respect their leader Cami Christensen - President & General Manager.    She leads with the heart and has created a healthy and high performance corporate culture.    Dawn Rawles - VP Marketing and Entertainment and Kayla Johnson- Ticketing Supervisor are fabulous to work with when booking shows and events. They roll out the red carpet for our groups every time we attend the shows. Crystal Stokes - F&B Director is amazing in providing dinner reservations for large groups.    The property is immaculate and always has something special showcased in the lobby. It holds a iconic history with its' many headliners and is truly a crown jewel of Las Vegas!    Barry Manilow Bronx Wanderers Soul of Motown Jen Kramer High Rocktane Cocktail Cabaret and the many concerts have been spectacular!    Thank you for everything you do for Sun City Aliante!
50,In Vegas for SEMA convention and saw the most outstanding lounge band at the Westgate. Our group met at the bar for a quick drink at 9 pm but we enjoyed the band so much that we ended up staying and drinking until 1 am. High Rocktane kept the bar packed and signing along all night. This band really made it a special night. Check out High Rocktane if you have the chance.
50,Excellent service high quality entertainment. Very clean and well maintained facility. Great selection of restaurants. I would highly recommend. There is so much to do under one roof. The live music was amazing.!
20,$226.70 added resort fee PLUS the $100 security deposit after was stated all taxes/fees included. Poor customer service. Housekeeping failed to come 3 out of the 6 days of our stay so we had to call down those evening to bring towels/toilet paper to the rooms. Had to go to service desk at 7am to get a laundry room key that wasn‚Äôt provided in check in. All the restaurants were ridiculously high priced.
50,Maggie Garcia was so helpful and went out of her way to help me create a wonderful memory. I got to meet Elvis Presley step brother David E. Stanley. She also took a picture of us showed me the Elvis statue and memorabilia from the original Hilton International Hotel. Thank you Maggie for your hospitality. You are a great in house greeter.
50,I was having the worst time until I ran across the greeter who saw I was going through something she stop me and actually talked to me. Her kindness really made me not feel stranded. I flew from Maryland to Vegas and was crying because I was scammed. It's good to know there are still humans in this world. Thank you Ms Maggie Garcia your kind words and advice saved my life because I swear I was about to do something I couldn't come back from
50,Best hotel casino in Vegas!  Everyone is so friendly & accommodating‚Ä¶  Our rooms are spacious & restaurants are awesome!  Slots are loose & it feels very safe here. Next to convention center so SEMA is just steps away. We‚Äôll be @ Elton John concert in a few hours. Can‚Äôt wait !!!!
40,The resort is nice but so old. I think that bathroom ( at least in our room) was renovated last time when Elvis was alive :) Personnel is attentive and polite. We ate breakfast in one of cafes and it was good. The location is not the best to my opinion and i would not walk there in the night . Considering the lower price i would rate this hotel to 4.
50,The front desk member that helped me was incredibly professional. Tyler T. I really appreciate the level of service Tyler provided he truly went above and beyond the requirements of the job. I would definitely visit again!
10,Just horrible. The waitresses are awful. The bartenders are awful. The sportsbook staff is awful. The managers are awful. Everyone who works here is a jerk. Stay away! It really isn't worth the trouble.
50,Had a fabulous dinner at the sushi restaurant. Before dinner had the most pleasant experience with Janice T. She was so helpful. Thank you Westgate üòä will definitely be back on the next trip to Las Vegas
10,We were booked for a wedding for upgrade rooms my husband and I my mother and my daughter we didn‚Äôt get upgrade rooms and the rooms bathroom shower and toilet liquin all the time air conditioner didn‚Äôt work properly and of course we make reservations 3 months before the event when we got there they didn‚Äôt have room available. A total disappointed.
50,Room was clean & cozy. The staff at the club were very warm & friendly.they greeted us everytime we go there fir breakfast & meals.  Parking os free & have plenty of parking spaces available. I would recommend this resort to friends.
50,So much fun came to Vegas for work stoped by the bar for a drink after dinner and didn‚Äôt leave the area or dance floor for a couple of hours the music and atmosphere was so fun I Will definitely be back !!!
50,I came to Vegas specifically for a music festival and stayed at the Westgate. Then the festival was cancelled. I was understandably sad and went down to the casino to gamble and drink my sorrows away. I landed at a roulette table with David Doyle as the dealer. This was the best decision I could've made. I was a novice so David helped me understand how to bet. I had so much fun with him and it completely turned my day around. I even won enough money to buy a ticket for the next day of the fest! David helped save my trip.  The hotel itself has lots of friendly staff and incentives for room credits. It wasn't the most glamorous but it had everything you need in a hotel. My only negative was that the bathroom tub wasn't draining properly so I had a bath at my feet when I showered. A very small note for a very great stay! I plan to stay again for the next trip!
50,Awesome experience! Barry Manilow was amazing. Carolyn was working in the theater and was so nice! Definitely would go back! And we are locals. We typically stay away from the hotels casinos etc. I would go the the Westgate for sure.
50,CRAIG IS THE MAN!! Absolute pleasure at 10 am! My first time in Vegas and he made me feel so welcomed!! He‚Äôs funnyknowledgeable witty and most importantly professional! We love him! He‚Äôs an absolute pleasure ‚ù§Ô∏è
30,"This should have been four stars except for one thing. Sometimes one thing matters.  First the good news: the Westgate is a good place to go nice rooms good towels great bedding and clean. The shows in the hotel are just the thing to see and then get on an elevator to go ""home"".  The Bad News: For years now hotels have provided a coffee maker or some kind of electric gadget to make hot water and a microwave. When I noticed there was no way to heat water we called customer services and were told that ""hot water was available for purchase at Fortuna their coffee shop"". Or! we could rent a microwave for $25 a day.  Really? Is this a joke? We ended up buying an electric kettle for out 4 day stay. I did not bring it home. So much for customer service. Attitude matters."
50,Brenda and Grace were the first employees we met as we came in to the hotel. They were friendly knowledgeable and made us feel welcome. Great employees!!!! That isn't common in Las Vegas. Loved the music in the bar area too!! Ms Payne is an excellent singer with a great personality makes everyone feel welcome
50,I've always had a good time at Westgate. Plenty of tables with reasonable minimums and the staff is super pleasant. I had a particularly good time playing roulette with David Doyle. Already looking forward to my next visit.
50,Dan the manager of the theatre went above and beyond for my family and I. His customer service was amazing. We had a situation and he went out of his way to make us feel at home. The other staff members were super nice and work extremely hard.
50,Great customer service . Good service with customers aida is very friendly . Them insure all customers are being greeted and insuring all a metis are available consistent with greeting    Team member Aida Angelick and afaf
50,Had a great time at the Westgate. The lounge was great. It was our first time in there and it was very welcoming from Angelick and Afaf they told us all about the different food service hours of breakfast refreshments and the happy hour which I can‚Äôt wait to come back for happy hour haha. We came a little early but atleast my husband enjoyed those cookies even took some to go. Will forsure be back
50,The greeter services were fabulous. They are very attentive and very clean. The hotel has a monorail stop. All the employees ask the tourist if they need any service. I like the smell of the hotel and it has several restaurants.
50,Thanks God we have the opportunity to meet Mr Westgate. Great customer service. He is a great and genuine diamond. He gave us a Elvis presley tour and show us all the restaurants and shows on property. After the tour we make reservations to benihana and purchased VIP tickets for motown show we enjoyed both thanks to Mr Westgate.  He is very fun professional and knowledgeable person and shows how much he loves his job. Plus he dress impeccable and professional. When we meet Mr Westgate at the front doors with his beautiful smile we feel at home. We really appreciate you Mr Westgate.
20,This hotel needs to be put out of its misery it‚Äôs way past its glory days as the former Hilton. Lousy restaurants smoke filled and boring casino with wretched service impossible lines for elevators and too many small things not right in my room. I won‚Äôt be staying here again.
50,Got there and wife was trying to meet one of the band members she knew. Usher suggested talking to Entertaimnent manager Dan. He had upgraded tickets he got us added a free drink and a meet and greet with band. Had an issue with some rude people and he comped us tix for the 2nd night. Wife got to meet her freind we had a great time both nights. Staff was accommodating and helpful.
50,Editha was kind and sweet! She‚Äôs an example to her colleague. She made sure that everything was in good shape. She would visit us and asked if we need something and greeted us with a smile on her face.
50,In-house greeters Ron and Armynne were excellent in what they do. They were welcoming to each and every member of my family. We had a family reunion. We start our day by going to the Westgate club for a continental breakfast then eat our lunch or dinner outside the hotel.  Although they serve same stuff everyday but they were healthy and these guys make it special for all of us displaying their welcoming attitude and service. We salute all in house greeters in the Westgate Club.
50,My best friend and I went to the Westgate Hotel to see the amazing Mr. Barry Manilow. What a great evening!  Everyone in the hotel was fantastic! Our greeter for our evening was someone I had heard about through friends his name is Mr. Westgate. There was nothing he would not do for us. Mr.Westgate is a humble yet energetic and caring young man with the excitement of a child when he was helping us. From the moment we met Mr. Westgate we felt like he was an incredible addition to an already iconic team and Hotel. Helping us feel like we were Royalty and so welcome in his Hotel.  My friend is disabled and on crutches. A wheelchair with a security officer was waiting for us after the show  which is another story in itself. The security officer and Mr. Westgate escorted us all the way to our car! We live in Las Vegas and have never had such welcoming and special treatment. That‚Äôs what I call extreme HOSPITALITY! Shellie Lara and Jose were all involved with our wonderful time also.  Barry Manalow created a magical show for all ages from 8 years old to 80! The lighting  backup singers and phenomenal music put us into another world. Barry talked to us all like family sitting in his living room!  Down to earth and very welcoming. His shared his entertaining spirit and and love for his music with us! Such a wonderful show! Time went by so quickly. We could have stayed all evening!!  We will be returning to the WESTGATE HOTEL AND THE BARRY MANILOW SHOW!  Thank You All üå∫    K. Davis
50,I lost my AirPods Pro at the free piano! And I called Edward for help and he helped me retrieve my AirPods in less than 3 minutes! He is so professional and friendly! Give this man a raise & a promotion! Please and thank you üôèüèæ    Edward if ur reading this. I just Wanna say thanks again! God bless you!
10,"We booked the Westgate as part of a wedding block for a nearby venue and were quite disappointed with our stay compared to experiences we've had at MGM Circus Circus and the Venetian. The toilet in our room rocked terribly when you sat down because it wasn't fully attached to the floor and had clearly been hastily caulked several times. The tab to direct water from the faucet to the shower head was jammed so that water ran out of both leaving very poor water pressure. Beginning at around 2:30 the morning before the wedding the emergency alarm went off suggesting everyone evacuate then before we could get fully dressed and begin our way down 25 flights of stairs it stopped. No follow up announcement of safety was made so we cautiously got back in bed. Then maybe 5 minutes later it started going off again so we jumped up again to get dressed....but it again stopped. Extremely frustrating since the hotel made ZERO announcements about whether the emergency had passed or whether it was a false alarm. We didn't know what to do but since the alarm stopped we went back to bed. We notified the manager of these issues and he was very nice and did offer us a $50 credit off one night. He also sent up a crew to look at the toilet but they knocked during a nap we took to try and regain some lost sleep before the wedding so at the Westgate we couldn't get sleep during the night OR the day - argh! But beyond these issues I have never experienced such INTENSE harassment from staff in the lobby pushing ""a free gift"" which is a ploy to get you to listen to their marketing seminars (similar to a time share) where they offer you a gift certificate but you also have to ""hold your place"" with a $40 deposit. One-time request I would've shrugged off - business is business - but these staff HOUND you every time you pass by the desk. Like I literally told a guy we'd already talked to them on my way to the front desk and less than a minute later when I returned from the front desk he tried to sell me on it again. This happened every single time we crossed through the main lobby. I've never ever experienced that anywhere else and it was truly exhausting making me want to minimize my time outside of my room. One staff member even talked to us about something totally different (my husband's shirt) while leading us in the direction of the counter so he could ""get the credit because he was on video."" I'll never stay at a Westgate again and you should avoid it at all costs!"
50,The hospitality at this resort was wonderful. Dawn Rawle went above and beyond!  The food and service at Rikki Tiki Sushi and Sid's Cafe were wonderful.  And if Manilow is in town....GO TO THE CONCERT!
10,This is without doubt the worst hotel I have EVER stayed in. Room was ok and the view was cool. But our toilet leaked. There was no coffeemaker or microwave in the room and over an hour wait in line for a coffee (or anything) in either of the coffee shops in the hotel and no room service before 7am. Three of the six elevators in our elevator bay were out of use so there was a 15-20 minute wait to get from or to our floor everyday. WiFi was an extra cost in top of our substantial room cost. And even after we connected (after trying for a full 24 hours after our arrival) the service kept cutting out. The only number on the room phone that ever answered was room service (even though their hours were very limited) and there was never anyone at guest services or the front desk outside of checkin or checkout times. The wrestling event we attended in the conference/meeting space (the only reason we stayed in this hotel) was the most disorganised chaotic event I‚Äôve ever attended. I can‚Äôt understand any of the positive reviews I see here as anyone I spoke to in any of the dozens of lines I stood in over the weekend had exactly the same complaints (one older gentleman said that in his two day stay he‚Äôd moved rooms twice because of mould and then leaks in his bathrooms) and all said they‚Äôd never come back to the Westgate again. After complaining as we checked out (when there were people on the front desk) the manager did refund the price of one night of our two night stay and all the extra service charges that were tacked onto our room. But that doesn‚Äôt improve the service or make up for a bad weekend. Every hotel/motel/guesthouse/b&b I‚Äôve stayed in across the US and Europe has a coffeemaker in the room free WiFi and someone at the desk or available for assistance. The Westgate was shockingly poor. Don‚Äôt spend your money here.
50,We've stayed at this hotel the past 6yrs for the Freak Show tournament. Dominic and Tracey are the most helpful in managing our room locations and customer service. We come in with a big wrestling crew and their families they always accommodate. Thank you for another great stay!
10,Buyer beware do not buy this Time share!!!!!! My roof leaked! I had no TV service and someone from house keeping stole my perfume!!!! They have no one available to solve any issues timely a nd I would not refer anyone to stay at this hotel resort!!!
50,I have attended about 90 Barry Manilow shows at The Westgate Las Vegas since he returned to the International Theater in 2018. During this time I've been treated with respect and kindness by associates in all areas of the resort including the Front Office Food & Beverage Housekeeping Retail Player Services Security Entertainment (particularly John & Dan) and Jose Romero Moreno (I'm not sure of his department but he is wonderful). Thank you all!
50,Excellent customer service. Mf. Westgate Jose the greeter was outstanding . He showed me everything I wanted yo see about Elvis from when he was there from the 70th. Only thing I couldn't see was the 30th floor maybe next time
50,We went to see Barry Manilow and the team members went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed and continue our excitement. We‚Äôve seen Barry for three generations so it‚Äôs very sentimental for my mother sister and I as we lost our grandmother. Caroline one of the team members saw our excitement and made our night! She upgraded our seats so we could be closer. Thank you so much for making this night so memorable! We definitely will be back!
50,Arlene Luther gets 5 stars for excellent customer service. She was very pleasant and helpful during the Barry Manilow concert. She was able to orchestrate a seating change so that I could better enjoy the concert. Thanks Arlene Luther an usher.
50,We attended the Saturday Evening show of Barry Manilow. It was such a great show! So nice to hear music with a melody and to see Barry‚Äôs energy and love of music on stage. One of the ushers Laura was amazing. So helpful and kind. She made the experience that much better. Roberto was fantastic too. Over all great experience from top to bottom!
50,Went to see Barry Manilow in concert at the hotel. Fabulous show and very well organised. We were welcomed at the theatre by Caroline who was an absolute sweety!! She very kindly upgraded our seats to the front row of the VIP tables on the stage! What a view!! I actually had Barry Manilow hold my hand! And sit 2 feet in front of us playing the piano! Thank you so much Caroline for being an amazing host and making our visit so very special xx
40,Room was very comfortable huge TV responsive HVAC. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Pool area is fabulous! The only negative : there‚Äôs not enough elevators long lines to get on them and long waits for them to respond to upper floors. Also - no site map to help navigate.
50,Aida is very friendly and funny and accommodating! We love her! She‚Äôs an awesome hostess! She tends to everyone‚Äôs need! She should have the best employee of the month! We had so much fun at the lounge coz of her! Keep it up! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
50,The theater is lovely and we thoroughly enjoyed the show put on by Barry Manilow. Our experience was enhanced by one of the security men - Mark C. He was so nice and professional. He made us feel welcome and wanted to be sure we enjoyed ourselves. Thank you Mark C!
50,It was a great experience since the man helped us get around. We were not sure where to go so he made the experience very easy for me. He showed all of us where to go and make our night pleasant instead of a night that could have been a problem
40,The room was clean modern and comfortable. The hotel is adjacent to a monorail stop which was extremely convenient to get to the strip. Having a refrigerator in the room was an added convenience. A very quick ride to the Sahara and from there an easy walk to the Stratosphere. Ten minute ride to the central strip and casinos there. It is an easy drive or cab ride to the old downtown and the Fremont Street Experience. Some reviews I read complained about the people trying to sell time shares. There were some people doing that but I did not find it overly intrusive and no problem to avoid that situation. The staff was great.
50,This was a great stay. We went from a Tuesday through Friday. Check in was a breeze. Every single staff member we dealt with was friendly and helpful. Our room was on the 19th floor and was very comfortable. Be aware there is no coffee in the room or microwave. We brought our own pot and things. If you want that first cup of coffee or tea in the a.m. you will have to go down to the Starbucks and pay $6.50 for a cup. There was a mini fridge. The room was clean the bed comfortable. If you are an older senior you might want to get a handicap room. There were no grab bars in the shower and the toilet was LOW! which was an issue for my hubby. One light in the room didn't work and was fixed in a jiffy by the staff. Sid's restaurant was very good but a little pricey. The portions were huge. There are other restaurants on the property as well. The monorail conveniently makes a stop right on the property. All in all highly recommended!
50,We loved the owners club on the 24th floor. Great food hospitality and space. We were always greeted by Armynne and Ron. They were very attentive especially to our dietary restrictions. And they‚Äôre just so friendly! Will be back! This hotel is great and all the staff are wonderful.
50,Jimmy the doorman rocks. He made our wait in the Taxi short and sweet. He keeps it moving. Give him a high five from us. He will take good care of you. The Westgate in Vegas was awesome. P.S Anthony was awesome too.
50,Loreal Afaf is great Host!!  Complementary happy hour and breakfast is great to have a god time and relax‚Ä¶ we have been owners since 2010 and have gone to several propoerties and here you can feel the VIP style.. thanks!
10,Nice room but...    1) The hotel did not honor the cost contracted through TripAdvisorPlus (TAP). We owed $47 at check in but the hotel ignored the TAP confirmation details and instead charged $136 at check in.    2) We requested a room cleaning on day one of our stay--no cleaning occurred. I called the front desk to discuss this and asked to speak to a manager. They said there was no manager on duty. I requested a room cleaning for the next day.  The next day I spoke with the housekeeper working our area of the floor. She said to call Housekeeping--so I did..  We went out for a day on the town and returned to an uncleaned room--again.  We never received a room cleaning while at the hotel.    3) Upon check out we waited for 15 minutes for an elevator to open on our floor.  Why? Three of the four elevators were out of service..  If we didn't get in an elevator going up (we never would have made our flight.  When the elevator went up to the top floor it then stopped on every floor on the way down.  No one else could fit in the elevator--so there were lots of people that were unhappy and likely late getting to their destinations that morning.    Awful experience at this hotel.  Never coming back there.  Book at your own risk!    PS The feedback app would not let me upload images in support of this review.
10,The worst service ever  there is none . I will never ever go to this dump ever again. Service is appalling non existent room smelly . My God do they go out of their way to make your experience miserable ?
20,We checked in and we were given a room near the elevator. All night we heard the DING of the elevator in addition to people coming in and out at all hours. When trying to catch the elevator be sure to give your self extra time. We waited 20 minutes for an elevator which we found ridiculous. People were opting to take the stairs after waiting 20-30 min for an elevator. In regards to our room the door to the bathroom did not close completely. However the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. Personally after this stay I am not a fan of the Westgate.
50,This happened last week but I wanted to leave a positive review on the experience. I was in late in the evening and Kelly who is a slot technician provided some of the best service I‚Äôve had! She was amazing!
50,Stayed at the Westgate for the annual NACS convention at the LV Convention Center. Checked in with Lyndia she was kind friendly and professional. She made the check in process absolutely painless. Room was beautiful and the overall service was unmatched.
50,Staff are friendly and accommodating. You can tell that they are compassionate with what they are doing. They love their jobs that for them it doesn‚Äôt feel like work. I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and relatives. They make you feel welcome just by their warm smiles( even with their masks are on you can tell). It‚Äôs my second time here andI love coming back here because of their service style.
50,Jennifer was fantastic. I did the Himalayan salt massage and added on the scalp and foot treatment. She used warm stones as well. Jennifer found all my tough spots and really got in there. Was so nice to be at a hotel spa and get a good massage ‚ù§Ô∏è
50,Staff are very friendly and accomodating thank you for your assistance on our breakfast. We will surely recommend this hotel to our friends and relatives when thwy visit Las Vegas. Thank you so much again
50,We didn‚Äôt stay this time but showed up for dinner. It‚Äôs super easy if you get on the monorail since the stop is right out front. We stopped in for dinner at Fresco Italiano and we‚Äôre very pleasantly surprised. My wife is a huge fan of Italian food and this was the favorite of the week as we traveled around the south. Huge bonus-High Rocktane was playing at the bar as we walked through to dinner so we came back after dinner and danced the night away to some amazing music! Really enjoyed the selection of tunes and a few drinks at the International Bar. It would have just been a quick walk back to the monorail if the band hadn‚Äôt sucked us in!
50,Went and stayed for about week had a great time. I will be back. The staff were great the food was amazing I would just walk around the hotel and just take it all in. The room was big and spacy loved it
40,"Room was clean and comfortable. BEAUTIFUL view especially sunrise and sunset. Amenities are plentiful.    My room location was near the ""Y"" so I could access from North or Central elevators.    There are plenty of restaurant and snack options.    Great access to the Convention Center next door; and the convention I attended used several Westgate meeting rooms."
50,I am an owner and the customer service received all the way around was wonderful we did have a couple of small issues prior to check-in but were immediately rectified when we got there. I love Westgate and I so looking forward to my future stays. The In House Greeters were amazing so friendly and consistent w/service Aida Afaf and Olivia thank you for the smiles every day we went to the Lounge .
50,All the staff were very pleasant and helpful especially Craig and Lyndia at the Front Desk. The restaurants Serenity Spa and Pool are all beautiful and well taken care of. And the food was delicious with generous portions.
50,An unforgettable weekend; the show the hotel the food Vegas everything was terrific. But first I want to give kudos to Maggie the hostess at the check-in area. You first see her beautiful sweet and sincere smile when you walk to the check-in. But not only that she was always attentive to our needs during our stay helping guiding and supporting us. I believe the hotel is lucky to have her talent and she is a role model for other associates.
50,The ladies were very kind and attentive to our needs. Aida and I talked about football and her favorite team!  I really enjoyed her company. Also her and my brother talked about his trip to Seattle. Which that's something she didn't have to do!
50,I was in Vegas for 5 nights and 6 days in the end of September of 2022 and had a amazing time. I would like to say my visit to the Westgate was fantastic. This visit was on my bucket list as I am a huge Elvis fan. What was just to be a walk threw of the hotels 1st floor to view the Elvis memories turned out to be a super wonderful experience for me. I must say a BIG thank you to Maria D. from the retail gift shop. This employee stood out and showed me the Elvis gift shop and introduced me to Elvis's step brother who was signing autographs that day and I had no idea he was there. This employee went that extra mile to make my visit to the Westgate resort I feel this employee deserves the recognition for going the extra mile to make happy.
50,What a nice spot to chill! We came in and were greeted by Olivia the atmosphere is wonderful. Aida Olivia and Afaf were very welcoming and helpful hosts! I'm definitely visiting next time! The snacks and drinks they had out were delicious Yum!
50,Our autistic daughter was very disappointed as the Manilow store wasn't open. But Darlene saved the day. She works at the main gift shop and was kind enough to open the Manilow shop so our daughter could have her own private shopping experience. Words cannot express the gratitude we are feeling towards Darlene and the Westgate staff.
40,Friday night in Vegas and rates went sky high (think this is usual for weekends?). However I managed to get a good rate on this hotel quite a bit cheaper than some gig name lower budget Strip hotels. So thought I‚Äôd pamper myself for one night!    So I can say it was worth it! A really nice regular type hotel/casino! Well kept friendly and exudes a nice ‚Äòvibe‚Äô. Check in was a breeze and all staff I found were great. From the reception staff to the Bell Desk through to the restaurants. The room was pretty good possibly not 5 star but very comfortable clean and welcoming.  The hotel isn‚Äôt on The Strip but I actually think this is a bonus. If you want the mayhem of The Strip the monorail is adjacent to the hotel and you can be back to center Strip in 5 mins. Personally I think this made for a nicer hotel clientele possibly slightly older. The casino is good not massive but good well priced friendly table games. A stand out is The Sports Book. A large area with a massive curved screen‚Ä¶..Very impressive. This is served by a bar and also a counter service restaurant bar. This whole area seemed comfortable and worked well.  In all a great end to my US vacation and I will definitely look to stay here again if I return!
50,I'm a Vegas local and was told there was a band playing at the Westgate on Thursday nights that I just had to check out named High Rocktane. Bands in Vegas are a dime-a-dozen but this band is different. The band members are really personable and kept the music flowing and the audience entertained the whole night! It was great to see the audience participation and the set list was outstanding. Everyone was dancing by the end of the night! The singer Kara could hit those high notes and you could tell that they all were really enjoying themselves on stage... true entertainers! I think I've found my favorite band in Vegas and will definitely be seeing them again!
50,Ms. Darlene truly deserves recognition for the excellent customer service she provided to me and my daughters. I would visit the strip store and recommend it to anyone who wants to purchase one of a kind Elvis Merchandise. I will definitely be back each and every visit just because of Darlene. Thank you Ms. DARLENE!!! YOU MADE OUR VISIT ONE TO REMEMBER!!
50,First time staying at Westgate. Was concerned it was a little off the strip but got a great rate and the Monorail stop at the hotel was convenient. Hotel was very nice. Great pool and loved the giant hot tub. Had some good restaurants too. Hotel staff were great. Got in early aroind 9:30am and could not check in but left our bags at the bell station and were on our way. Came back several hours later and there was a long check in line but it wne toast. Was concerned about getting a room since it was still early but was happy to find put the desk staff earlier had blocked us a room on the 25th floor . Had one issue with the shuttle downtown but the Transportation Manager more than made up for it. Thank you! All in All great stay and would definitely stay again and recommend to others.
50,Retail gift shop at the west gate in Las Vegas on the strip. She was extremely nice and has great customer service and gave us all the information about military discounts. She was very friendly. We will come back.
50,We had finished dinner and were heading back to our room when we passed the lobby bar. The band playing caught our attention so we stopped to watch for a few minutes. 3 drinks each and 3 hours later we enjoyed some of the best live music I have seen in a long time. What a show and what a band! Hi rocktane is the real deal.
50,Very fun and friendly people! Made my stay here at the westgate that much more enjoyable! Will definitley be coming back for the atmosphere they provided. Losing track of time and socializing with everyone who came by!
50,Proving to be more than knowledgeable Mr. WESTGATE proved to be exceptional as a teammember of the Westgate Resort. I will for sure go back just to learn more of the history of Elvis and talk to Westgate again.
50,I would like too personally thank Sylivia and Jay at Owner Check In for assisting us with our issues with our rooms. We were having issues with the main office on how many rooms we had. Sylivia and Jay helped us work through it and my family was able to continue to enjoy Vegas with all the rooms we needed. Their customer service is spot on I am retired military and people are always saying thanks for your service I would like to say to Sylivia and Jay thanks for your service. The Franklin's
50,we visited the westgate hotel on our last day in las vegas because we were sad there is not much elvis themed things on the strip. so we thought we save the best for last and it truly was because we met mr. westgate in his wonderful outfit. he brought uf so much happyness and gave us the full elvis expierience. we will be forever thankful for the memories he gave us. mr. westgate is a true angel and wonderful human. thanks to him and to the lovely guy from the elvis store. we hope to see you next year again.  love from switzerland
10,When making reservations for the Las Vegas location of Westgate Resort and Casino we were told our stay will be 1/2 price if we sit thru timeshare sales pitch. We were told would only take 60 - 90 minutes and no pressure. We were told it is a real estate investment we could easily sell if we decided to we could rent out our timeshare and make lots of money (the sales rep said he had 2 timeshares and has made over $400k this year - why was he pushing 70 still working and wearing cheap jewelry???) maintenance fees would not go up and HOA fees would stay same. Plus my husband looked at reviews on line and read all the horror reviews. The same lies told to them were told to us. We decided this wasn‚Äôt for us. Since we were not buying we were kept hostage and pressured for almost 5 hours. The initial price was $60k and after several price changes went down to $7k. The last cow sent to pressure us was very rude and inappropriate. She angrily accused us of not letting her do her job. We finally got angry stood up and our voices were raised. People started looking and that was the only reason we were finally allowed to leave. As we were leaving we demanded our room discount. We got our discount and filed a complaint.Besides that nightmare we were given a room that was already occupied our room was in poor condition. The shower didn‚Äôt work; the veneer on the bathroom cabinet was peeling and hanging and there was veneer pieces on the floor. The room decor was outdated poor lighting and looked like a pimps bedroom (very large black leather diamond tuck bench and red leather diamond tuck couch black shade on all lamps large black headboard etc) and it had a bad smell. The whole 19th floor. Three hundred dollars a night and not even on the strip and in poor condition very few eateries small casino I could go on and on. Do Not Stay here or fall for the schpeel for 1/2 price to attend a sales pitch. NOT worth it. This hotel is a dump.
50,A dream come true to see this man in concert! Stopped at the store prior to the concert and picked a purple boa to add to my outfit.    I entered the venue and showed my tickets for the rear orchestra section and was quickly told to that I was going to be given better seats! They moved me to the VIP section!    I was so incredibly excited for the opportunity and thoroughly enjoyed singing along and being that close to the stage!    Such a memorable night!
50,We visited to celebrate a milestone anniversary. Pleasantly surprised by how attentive and friendly the service was. From the greeting at the front door to the bell desk we were treated with exceptional care . Our room was beautiful very clean comfortablehad a lovely strip view. Water pressure was very good lovely shower and a mini fridge was included..We had a lovely first meal at  the sports book delicious!! Sids cafe for breakfast the next day was lovely. They gave us two plates because we split our omelet . Service was top notch. We had a hotel employee take our photo in front of the Elvis statue very nice of him to offer! Hubby was happy with on-site tennis Frankie the assistant pro was happy to facilitate all his needs. The monorail was a godsend to us we were able to get to the strip in under 10 mins  There was also a lovely scent in the hotel that we still miss! The only things that weren't so good was that we could not get a players card...perhaps we called it the wrong name??? We were also hounded by people selling timeshares...between them and other retailers we felt like we were running the gauntlet at times lol .We also were dismayed by seating that was not accessible to myself ( too many bar height chairs and stools) But we would stay again in a heart beat thank you for a lovely and memorable holiday.
50,The most engaging and wonderful doorman in Vegas works at the Westgate! Jimmy the Doorman is one of the individuals on this earth that makes our world a better place! He was so very helpful and kind. I also want to add that the staff at this hotel were all very professional and helpful. At the restaurant my server was Juana and she was great as well.  Thank you
10,"I was here for a conference that ran from 8 - 6 each day. The gym doesn't open until 7 a.m. and closes at 6 p.m. so my early morning workout had to be outside. I was walking around outside the hotel and nearly was mugged near the convention center. I wouldn't recommend this place. I've gone to Vegas for conventions for years and I would never stay at this place. It is dated. The room was nice but the place just feels ""old"". And I didn't find it to be very safe or accommodating (i.e. gym hours). I did complain to them about this. Maybe they will do something. Maybe not."
50,We want to say a special thank you to Aida Kay and Olivia at Westgate Club in Westgate Las Vegas.  These ladies have been so friendly and helpful to us during our stay. Always friendly and fun- thank you ladies ! üíï
50,Ron Armyne was extremely attentive and professional. He always greeted me when I came into the owners club and kept positive vibes all around. Guy is just great. This was my first time in Vegas and me and my family enjoyed it so much. Thank you Ron and West Gate
50,Excellent service Kay Aida Afaf are so kind and helpful they made me feel comfortable meanwhile I was staying here. Thanks for them they make me feel like i was important the food the wine the beer all more than 5 stars I loved it I'm looking to come again cuz of them thanks!
50,Room was absolutely beautiful! Dining was excellent. Especially Edge Steakhouse! Casino was great to play in and very exciting! Staff was very nice and accommodating and Casino Executive Valerie Mazzola is the BOMB! She is the BEST in the business! She is always on top of everything! So detailed organized extremely friendly and always very accommodating! Valerie and WGLV is the Best that Vegas has to offer!
20,In town for a convention and while the convenience of the short walk to the convention center is wonderful the smell of the hotel negated the convenience. Imagine a wet dirty ashtray with a bad air freshener losing the battle. Hits your upside the head the minute you enter the hotel. ü§¢ I was in the central tower and the rooms were road hard and put away wet. While they beds were decent and clean the room is just tired. Could use some new life and updating and some lights. The room was super dark. Restaurants were pretty good. Wine selection was mediocre and don‚Äôt even order wine at the casino bars unless your ok with giant bottles of Vendage. Overall just super sad that this place has gone so far down hill. Step it up Westgate.
40,I spent a lot of time at the pool and it was fantastic. Had a great relaxing time. Enjoyed the pool tournament I was there for which seemed well-organized. Parking was right across the street from hotel and free. Very convenient. My room wasn't ready when I arrived. I got there very late and apparently they had overbooked and decided to bank on me not showing up. I had to wait about 25 minutes while they got one ready but they did give me a nice big room which made up for it. Amenities in rooms seemed random - I had a mini-fridge other friends staying there had a microwave but no fridge one had a dishwasher. Just be ready for anything! There was an odd noise in my room (a/c I think) but I brought ear plugs so I managed. I think they didn't plan on putting anyone in that room. I wish the casino didn't allow smoking. Just walking through it to get to the rest of the hotel was gross. Bring plastic silverware if you might need it - getting a silverware set brought up to the room is a $10 charge! Service at the bars in the casino wasn't always the fastest. All in all I had a good time here and would consider staying here again. Bathrooms in the common areas were well tended to. Karina Arnold did an excellent job.
50,We bought tickets at the last minute and when we visited the usher to seat us we were so graciously upgraded by Lisa and Dan. I took my friend who is fighting cancer and has never seen Barry in concert so this was so very much appreciated. We had a great time and highly recommend the Westgate resort AND seeing Barry Manilow while you're there!
50,Armynne and Michael were very attentive throughout our visit. They definitely put food out when they need it and for cleaning the whole time we were there. We even had some questions for him and they answered everything we needed. We definitely love the attention that they give us here in the club
50,The staff of the Westgate Hotel And Casino were fantastic. The crew at the Barry Manilow concert venue really stood out. They definitely brought their A game tonight! Thank you guys for a wonderful experience it was appreciated. Xoxoxoxo
50,Sam at the front desk is amazing! Great friendly service! He upgraded my room to a Studio Suite. The room was recently remodeled and I really liked the design style. I loved the Wet-bar with comfy bar stools. Sink fridge micro real plates dishes and silverware. Very comfortable bed. Good mattress and pillows. Slept great which is a bonus in Vegas! Luxurious bathroom with rainfall shower. Nice new furniture. Wall safe.
50,Aida and Glenda were great hostess. Very attentive and friendly. Thank you for your hospitality.  We will definitely be back to enjoy the hospitality and the good snacks    We accidentally spilled the drink and they were very attentive to clean it up and make sure everything was to our satisfaction
50,Barry Manilow did not disappoint. He his band back up singers entertained the whole audience. It was a heart warming remember when concert. We sang every song. And he did not forget any favorites. Would definitely visit him again!
50,We watched Barry Manilow‚Äôs concert last 15 September. It was really great seeing iconic Barry performing live!!! I loved my souvenir glass for the pi√±a colada It was worth watchingVery impressiveüòçü§©üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
50,Staff were helpful accommodative friendly and generous! Gave us free wifi discounts at restaurants and access to the concierge lounge for being owners. The lounge gave us free breakfast drinks snacks and free alcohol at night. Plenty of stuff to do here at Westgate.
50,It‚Äôs so nice in here and the staff is extra friendly!! There are televisions tables and a computer and they offer a nice little variety of snacks and refreshments. There are cakes cookies pastries and even a small little happy hour with cheese and wine.
50,Highly recommend The Spa with a calm vibe and use of the many facilities after beauty treatments. Try a very relaxing massage with Jennifer Deerham. The Staff was friendly and the facilities were both clean and elegant. It is located at the end of the Strip Monorail and also has free Westgate Hotel Parking. A hidden gem from old Vegas.
40,we stayed here in our 1 week vegas vacay booking 5 signature rooms the check in was a bit rough as the girl receptionist said i only have a 1 room reservation its a good thing the a young man step in and showed her how to find my full reservation when we got up to our rooms some of the rooms are dirty and smell like weed but because its a busy week and we all want to be on the same floor we replaced 1 room and the 2 other rooms were cleaned the rest of the week went smooth rooms were cleaned and tidy everyday unless we say otherwise everything you need is on the premises different restaurants starbucks gift shops we did eat at 2 restaurants the japanese and italian both were good positive experience casinos and bar were average they do have live music which was nice. the amenities on the resorts are fitness centre pool and spa which we did use for westgate owners like me we have a clubhouse( snakcs and hot drinks) and laundry room free to use. monorail stops at westgate and shuttle bus to the strip. two options if you dont want to drive. most of the staff we encountered were nice and friendly especially the morning crew in the clubhouse! i do recommend this hotel which is at the end of the strip.
50,AMAZING !!!  HIGH ROCKTANE rocked our world  what a way to end our holiday in Vegas . The music was non stop bangers ; with something for everyone to shake down to or get your grove on. Don‚Äôt miss out and get your boogie on at the Westgate with the very best band in town. A memory to lady a lifetime  thank you HIGH ROCKTANE ‚Ä¶ BIG LOVE
50,Awesome band! Rocked the Westgate with all kinds of music! Loved them!! The band is amazing! Played so many different types of music! We loved them! Can‚Äôt wait to see them again! Love the vibe energy and music.
50,Mr Westgate (Jose) is so very helpful with all types of questions and answer plans best plan A best plan B...HE'S FANTASTIC!!!! Snazzy dresser too I ALWAYS trust snazzy dressers! Westgate is wonderful place to stay with the monorail line right here!
50,Very accommodating staff specially Ron and Angelik the in house greeters. Property has gone under a complex renovation making it an equal to the younger properties in the strip. The location is slightly off the Vegas blvd but there is a constant flow of cabs also there is a monorail station right besides the property and ask about the shuttle service.
50,One of the reasons I read it the best is because of Mr. Westgate. He was a greeter. In fact he‚Äôs probably one of the nicest people I met while I was there. Been there several times but I must say I will remember this trip forever he was so kind Curteous let me take a picture with him so I could show all my friends. I‚Äôd go back just to see him. Lol
50,"Whenever the pricing at the mega-resorts on the Strip goes beyond reason I stay here. This was the first mega-resorts casino hotel heavily featured in the recent movie Elvis as its original name the International. The tower design an upside-down Y is replicated/seen all over the Strip nowadays. But here the hallways are a bit smaller than the typical Strip hotel. They actually have more types of room options than a typical Strip hotel from tall the way up to 12K square feet. As I am not a ""whale"" I can only imagine that. That aside a hotel lives and dies on its customer service and all our experiences have been great. Somsak is the most friendliest funniest and best front desk person I have ever dealt with in a city that is increasingly going automated to cut cost. Even the security guards were friendly when helping you. Yes the place shows its age but there's free parking. That is a rarity. If you can park in the North Tower garage and get a room in the North Tower so you don't have to walk through the casino to get to your room. There's free EV charging in the back of the North Tower garage too. Obviously if you are Manilow fan you will want to go here to see him in person at his long time residency here. The only small downside I found in our trip was our window had a single-level of blackout curtains - there was no sheen curtain behind it to let light in but shade it a bit."
50,Had an event over the weekend had a show car and the staff at the valet parking Jamar and Micheal W went far and beyond to make sure my car was well taken care of and safe will definitely stay there again see u next year guys!
30,Facilities were cool and the staff are amazing. I can‚Äôt fault them at all. The biggest let down was how painfully outdated the room was. The room felt like I stepped back 20 years. The state of the shower was BAD; weak pressure and not properly working. The only lighting for the main room are lamps. Wifi kept cutting out on the room which caused me to use my roaming data. That was frustrating as it was part of the daily resort fee.  TV reception was poor and unable to watch at least 5 channels. No USB charging ports for international appliances like other hotels I‚Äôve been in.
50,They are very good people to be around. I love the layout of the establishment. My favorite dealers are soon A.Zieba M.Crawford (manager) and L.Luu. Great laid bck place for the whole family. Will recommend to family friends and whoever. My family for real.
50,$500 cabana was all worth it because of Logan Rex!! The fruit tray was a bit old and she got us a fresh one ASAP!! She was friendly profession and energized! Drinks never got low. 10/10 would recommend her!
20,We came on Saturday September 3 to experience the Saturday/Sunday Brunch. The advertised hours were 7:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m. We got there close to 9:00 a.m. We stopped to get players cards first at the cage (the players club desk did not open until 10:00 a.m.) My husband received his but because my last name included my maiden as well as my married name I was given my ID back and told a card could not be made for me. Something about the machine not accepting it. I have never had this happen at any other casino. That was the first strange issue. The next was that the entire FRESH buffet was closed with no explanation given. Even the bartender near the Sportsbook was confused and said this happened often but he didn't know why. We were dismayed to find that the buffet operated this way ignoring the hours posted in the website. Very poor customer consideration all around. I'm very surprised and disappointed. We both thought the Westgate was far better than this.
50,We were greeted by Lyndia the front desk associate. She was amazing! She made us feel so welcome and we knew we would be well taken care of. She was personable informative  welcoming and funny. The experience you get when you first arrive is the most important. Thank you for one of the best check in experiences I‚Äôve had!
50,We had to book a last minute room here without knowing anything about the hotel. For it's age they've done a fantastic job on the upkeep and was probably at one point a top tier hotel. It was an amazing deal at $60 for the night compared to similar hotels in the area.  The staff was great and let us check in a little early. The hotel has coffee restaurants and a casino. While the casino was small and a bit quieter it can be a nice break from the larger casinos. The room had a nice view and comfy bed.  Location isn't great. It is on the North end of the Strip close to Circus Circus but isn't actually located on the Strip. To help it does have a drop off for the monorail with easy access to the main part of the Strip
50,I went here because I wanted to see where Elvis played in Vegas. I was greeted immediately by Mr. Westgate who showed me around to all the of the things Elvis. He didn‚Äôt have to and I was so very appreciative. Stayed and gambled a while too and was glad I went. I will be back. Thank you again Mr. Westgate!
50,Awesome service and so personable to play with! They really took care of us at the Westgate hotel in Las Vegas!!! Amazing. Came here to fight in Las Vegas on a boxing card and leading up to the fight this place has been extraordinary
50,Hard to put in to words how wonderful this band was‚Ä¶ my good friend Rob told me he started seeing a band every Thursday night last year. When I told him I was coming to visit Vegas former Vegas resident myself I was all in to at least check them out.    I was surprised at the variety of music they play. The energy is great! Whenever I head back to vegas either to visit or move back  High Rocktane will be a guaranteed part of my activities whenever  whenever they play!    I had the opportunity to meet each of the band‚Äôs member because of Rob and each person was kind warm open and appreciative of all the support. It‚Äôs not too often you see this level of talent combined with a total kindness from each person. Thank you for being so welcoming even if to a visitee such as myself :)    I cannot speak highly enough of this band. Make sure when you‚Äôre in Vegas - check out High Rocktane @ Westgate Hotel & Casino‚Äôs Band on Thursdays 8-12a at the I-bar. You won‚Äôt regret it!
40,Mr. Westgate was very helpful friendly and just a great Ambassador for the Westgate.  The hotel was very clean and the staff quite pleasant! Nice pool area and a fabulous central bar just off the lobby - a great place to meet up with friends and end the evening with a nightcap.  Easy access to the Monorail; off the crazy beaten path but close enough to get there quickly and a lot going on in the hotel itself.
40,We were at the Westgate for a concert and had a fantastic time. We Love the pool and all of the venues. Very easy to get around. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We are looking forward to our next vacation in September 2023.
30,"Stayed in Room 2827 Central Tower. The room was dirty and run down. It was nothing like the photos shown in the on line ad. The bed skirt was faded and had holes. I took photos of the old bed skirt. The glass on the dressers was stained and had water spots. I took photos of the dressers. The sink was filthy. I took photos showing the grime on each faucet. The bathroom wooden vanity had chips and paint missing. I took photos of the vanity. The tub/shower was dirty. I took photos. The floorboards were run down and were scratched with paint missing. There appeared to be mold on the base boards. Photos taken. The ""fresh"" white towels were stained and one of the hand towels had a long black hair embedded in it. I have short white hair. Very disappointing. I would not recommend this room to anyone."
50,Had an amazing experience at the spa today Jennifer is an amazing massage therapist. The spa was so clean staff was so friendly and it was an enjoyable experience. The casino was clean and again friendly staff and accommodating.
50,Our stay at Westgate Las Vegas was amazing! Lyndia checked us in and she was friendly accommodating and down to earth! We knew we had picked the right place for a first time visit to Vegas. I would definitely recommend this hotel to my family and friends.
50,Aida was an amazing host! Made us feel very welcome and provided everything we need. The others were great as well Ron and Angelick.    The place is very clean and has a warm atmosphere. Good for family vacations.
50,I wanted to take a moment and acknowledge the wonderful service I was given by Juana Hurtado in the Entertainment department. She went above and beyond to welcome and accommodate my friend in a wheelchair In the Cabaret venue this weekend for the Big Blues Bender event at Westgate Hotel In Las Vegas. She was kind and helpful in finding us a seat and even putting herself between the wheelchair and another guest when they started to bump against the chair. She was just wonderful. If there is an award to be given for outstanding service  she should receive the prize. There are still kind people in the world.    -Kasey Schultz
40,We usually stay on the strip but booked this to save $. It was a good 20 minute walk to the strip which was fine by us. There is a McDonalds within a 10 minute walk. The area isn‚Äôt the best. There are some homeless people hanging around so be prepared for that. There is a monorail station right at the hotel and they have a nice pool. The rooms were good but there were a few small things: the sink was oddly positioned so it was a bit uncomfortable when brushing my teeth and there extension cords were used to power the lamps. The room itself was big clean and the beds were comfortable. I would stay here again.
50,Afaf was super nice and personable to me and wife Monica! We stayed three nights in room 2450 and the members room was just down the hall from us with a great view. Any questions we had or things we saw throughout the day she was fun and knowledgeable to talk to about our Vegas experience. Def give her a raise ü•∞ thank you West Gate üëå
50,Nice talking to Juana Hurtado from the Intertainment Department. We were treated very polite and talked about Elvis' concerts his stay at the Penthouse Suite his dressing room the bronze statue and how one of Juanas kollegues has worked at the hotel when Elvis was there from 1969 up into the 70's.
50,Excellent customer service. They greeted us with warm welcome and accommodating and helpful the whole time of our stay. The place is well kept cleaned and refreshments are awesome. Definitely a family friendly place to hang out.
50,Our stay was great hotel was clean and we had the pleasure of being served in the westgate club by Loreal Kay and Armyne. All professional and friendly workers. We‚Äôre happy to have been served by a great team.
50,"I was recently in Las Vegas for the 2022 APA World Champions for Team 8 ball and Captain's Tournaments. After a long day of shooting pool I decided to play blackjack. I had $1400 in chips one $1000 and four $100 from the previous day. I threw all 4 chips on the table and the dealer asked if I wanted to get ""color"" for the $1000 chip as well. And I thought no I'll keep that one in my pocket. Well apparently it fell onto the floor behind my seat with people walking by for about 15 minutes. I stood up in-between shuffles put my hand in my pocket and the chip was gone! I looked around on the floor too....gone! I then noticed the pit bosses looking at my panicked face. One came over and asked what the problem was. I told them my sad story and they pointed at Jesus Corral. I'm not sure of his job title but I believe he was in the housekeeping/maintenance department. EVS porter I believe. In any event Jesus found my $1000 chip and turned it in. How many people would have simply put it in their pocket and said finders keepers!?!? After they reviewed the video they returned my $1000 chip! I tipped Jesus handsomely and shook his hand with my faith restored in humanity. Okay a little dramatic....LOL!    A huge shout out to Jesus Corral and the Westgate for being honest and returning a $1000 to me!!!"
50,Manny greeted us as we came in by the flower wall. He took our picture and even got in the picture with us. He was so friendly and has the warmest smile. Made our evening. Very sweet disposition. The casino however was way to cold to hang out in.
50,During our stay in westgate Las Vegas we had the pleasure to be served by Ms. Afaf and Ms. Aida; the in house greeters. Both ladies were amazing...both are highly professional so friendly welcoming helpful and are tending to the club perfectly...  Thank you Afaf and Aida...
50,Great Service! Friendly Cashier. Went to buy some beverage and bandage. They show me where also we got some excellent conversation. They are friendly and nice lady. Specially Delia. hope to visit again.
50,Hands-down meeting Mr. Westgate and experiencing the passion he has for his job and the beautiful hotel he represents was the highlight of our Vegas trip. We met him two days into our trip and were given a very informative tour of the hotel. He recommended the Motown show which we attended And bought front row tickets. The show was an absolute blast with incredible talent. Mr. Westgate spoke highly of the team he works with as well as the hotel. We are already planning our return to Vegas and will be staying at the Westgate to enjoy its rich culture and history as well as visit With who we now consider our friend Mr. Westgate.
50,Amazing dealers thank you Aneta and Crawford. Both were such a delight and taught us newbies! I loved Westgate clean and open not congested. All the staff were so nice and environment clean. Drinks were on point and service exceptional.
50,Arrived yesterday... everyone has been awesome! Big shout out to Maggie Garcia in house greeter for her great personality and wit! The bell hop (sorry don't recall his name) was kind enough to find me some plastic spoons. Definitely beyond the call of duty! It's these small things that add up to a great stay!
50,Angelick /Kelsie / Ron are the most amazing pepole i will ever meet they are so come on down to the owners club and have a blast the food amazing the have breakfest starts at 7 am and lunch is at 12 and dinner at 5 to 7
50,Ron/Armynne/Angelic person we met.......  very presentable presentation food area  very clean surroundings and very neat  quite area and relaxing area  specifically you've very nice view at 24th floor  stunning over looking view....you can see almost whole last vegas strip...very welcoming an excellent room for the early morning breakfast
50,As soon as we walk in to the Westgate hotel in Las Vegas we were greeted by wonderful Mr Westgate. Right away we felt welcomed and his charismatic and fun personality made us feel the need to learn more about his position there at Westgate. Mr. Westgate was very helpful in guiding us to the areas that we wanted to visit. He had an answer to all our questions and made our visit there at Westgate more meaningful.. We love that he is latino too and we have that in common. Viva Las Vegas Viva Westgate and Mr Westgate ‚ù§Ô∏è  Mr. Westgate if you get the chance to see this review just know that next time we are in Vegas we will go to Westgate and stay there for you!!! You made our trip there to Cegas much more meaningful!! ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è  Thank you!!    Sincerely  Eva
50,Butch provided excellent customer service! I left my AirPods in my room and was at my gate at the airport when I remembered. There were several steps that had to take place and Butch communicated well and followed through on each step! Bravo and I am so grateful as they were a gift from my children and useful as well as treasured!
50,Very good show. High energy great sound. Good location and size of theater. Those big boys could sure move. They hardy ever stood still The variety of music was good I would definitely attend this show again
50,Tyler T at the front desk was the most helpful person I have ever met in any customer service environment ever! He deserves a giant raise or a promotion to upper management it was overall a great experience and I will definitely be back to this hotel every time I visit this area! Thank you all for your kind service!
50,Alberto provided outstanding customer service!!! Outstanding hotel!!! We enjoyed our stay here. There were plenty of things to do. The view from the room was outstanding. We were provide quality room service.
40,The bed was huge and very comfortable I had a king size. I only stayed to attend the BEST performance of my life. The Soul of Motown is a must see experience. The performers rank from a scale of 1-10 I give them a 100. Yes I said 100! You will be transformed back to the good times in music history. This show is outstanding. I would fly back to Vegas to see it again. It is worth every dime spent. The talent is superior! I also liked the fact that there was a small store to purchase incidentals. The sportsbook is phenomenal watching horse racing football soccer and basketball was a dream. I also might add that the room rates are beyond reasonable. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. i look forward to another visit.
50,We love Craig! We had a long flight and his smile and demeanor put at right as ease. This is our 3rd time to Vegas but our first time to Westgate and check in was a pleasure!!! His manager Jennifer is also a gem!
50,My wife and I recently stayed at Westgate for a pageant and the hotel was fantastic. But one of the highlights was the outstanding lounge band called High Rocktane. This band knows how to put on a great show and keeps the crowd dancing all night. I was very impressed with the singer and we will be back again soon.
10,I made a reservation for 4 nights at this hotel last week. I looked at my credit card the next day and it had an unauthorized charge of 160 dollars by Westgate. I.I called Westgate and they said that it was for the first night. I told them that it was never discussed when I made the reservation. I asked them for my bill balance and it was 200 dollars higher than the original price. I asked them why and they said they would have to listen to the original call before they would bill me the original price. I canceled my reservations. The bait and switch trick.
50,We absolutely enjoyed our time spent at the Westgate! Clean rooms friendly and helpful staff and don't forget awesome food. You have to check out Sid's and the Turkey Club. We look forward to coming back!
50,Great Helpful Staff and Activities To Keep You Enjoing The Areas Spacious Layout. Located In A Ideal Walking Area To Restrauants and Las Vegas Convention Center. They Have A Wonderful Kids Gaming Area Too!  Owners of The Westgate Timshare Also Have A Ideal Area for Eating and Happy Hour Upstairs With A Big View
50,Michael Jacob was amazing! He talked to us about where we were from and travel reason and then told us some places to go that he thought we‚Äôd like. The other staff talked to us about additional places to visit. A+ Westgate!
50,Wow this experience exceeded my expectations. I was greeted by Amy & Dawn and I must say- this was the most incredible experience I've had in years and I live in Las Vegas. The hotel has a warm feeling and it's kept it's original charm. This is truly a gem and underrated greatly. The rooms are spotless the restaurants are delicious and you get a welcoming vibe as soon as you enter the main doors. I will forever love The Westgate! The staff is definitely delivering world class service. Thanks for having us! üôèüèªü§ç WE WILL BE BACK ü•∞
50,The In-house greeters at the Westgate Club Aida Afaf & Ron are all amazing people cordial and very helpful. They've extended a helping hand and accommodated us over and beyond our usual expectations. Thank you for making our vacation experience one to remember.
50,Our family is very grateful to Aida and Olivia for their warm welcome and great service. We also want to thank Kay Ron and Armynne for their graciousness and generous and hard work in making sure we have all we need.
50,Sylvia Munar  Very very helpful to our issue on reservation as an owner. All her service were recognized & feel more comfortable to make decisions for an upgrade. We now on the westgate Las Vegas as our home resort. Proud westgate owner. Thank for good service Sylvia.    Dan Ocampo
40,Logan with Beverage at the pool was amazing on both of my visits. She remembered me on my second visit from my first visit. She also remembered what drink I preferred and had the other waitress bring me that drink. I found her to be a very courteous and gracious host. She made my time at the pool much better. I cannot say enough good about her.
50,Armynne & Angelick are excellent of doing there job. They keep it clean and stock. Great service. Can't wait to be back here. They are full of joy and great smiles all morning. Will forsure be back here
50,Joanna.E was the best front desk rep I've ever encountered. Very professional polite and very helpful. She is the reason we are doing this review!!! We are definitely returning back to Westgate. Very beautiful place.
50,Very Nice Attentive Staff  Ron Olivia and Aida are great  in making sure snacks are replenished.  They make sure that tables are cleaned.  My friends are having wonderful time.  Highly recommend this Resort!
50,Mar√≠a at the gift shop is amazing. :) so kind and sweet. I will be back just to see her ! She recommended that we go to Fremont street to see a live band. I‚Äôve never been but I know that we will have a blast!
20,My friend and I stayed here 7/29-8/1. When we first go to our room we could hear the water literally running out of the shower bath faucet. We immediately responded to our welcome text to notify staff. There was a quick response saying this would be addressed but no one came. I sent another message and went to the front desk the next day to get status on when this would be fixed and to also let them know that the AC was not working right and it was warm in our room. The lady at the front desk said it would be addressed still nothing. I sent a couple more messages and eventually just gave up. It was apparent that nothing was going to be done. After checking out I did send a couple more messages asking for a supervisor to contact me. I got a nice response from a staff member saying she would pass on the message but two weeks later and nothing. The non-stop noise of water running warm muggy room and the fact that the place wreaked of cigarette smoke made for a pretty unpleasant stay. I forgot to mention my friend pillows smelled like BO.    The positive were: bed was comfortable nice view great restaurants and friendly staff.
50,Tyler T. At the front desk is great. He had the most welcoming personality treated us like we were the most important guests answered every question we had and did it all with an energetic smile. He went above and beyond for us.
50,I visited the Westgate this last weekend with a group of friends for the APA. The Thursday we arrived we were blown away by the band that was playing by the entrance. We came back down after our check-in and rocked away with them until midnight. It was amazing. I wanted to thank you for providing such fantastic entertainment! Please pass me and my friends appreciation on the the guys and gals from High Rocktane!
50,Kara and High Rocktane were awesome! So engaging! Had us singing and dancing. Love hearing them! Can't wait for the next set and more dancing and singing!!!!  The base guitar player and singer is awesome!
50,I am very pleased of their services and the in-house greeters are very friendly and pleasant especially Armynne Ron  Aida & Kay. And importantly they keep up the place very neat & clean. They frequently replenish the beeakfast items.
50,My hubby and I came here to celebrate our 23rd anniversary! We originally booked through Southwest vacations. So we were not sure what we were going to get. Upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly staff. And when we got to the room whoa! It was gorgeous. There are a variety of delicious restaurants on site shopping entertainment. We especially enjoyed the Motown show. The nail spa and pool added to the fun and relaxation. Our time here was nothing short of amazing. We will return.
50,We we had a wonderful time at Westgate. We were blessed to share our time with warm and friendly service with Aida Row Glenda and Afaff - The Greenhouse - Club House.staff. Thanks Aida for your welcoming attitude and expressions. Hope to see you again. You guys made our stay enjoyable. Deloris Dorothy Faith.
50,Complimentary breakfast was nice. We were greeted as we arrived with courtesy. ArmynneRonand Kay helped and directed us to tables . Over all services were good. The place is wonderful. These people are at most very helpful to me.  .
50,Good service from: Row Aida Afafa in house green.  Everything is clean they are very polite friendly.  There is a very good people attending all people that come to this place all the times that we were there every thing is good..
50,Awesome exceptional service at the Westgate club. This free welcome service during breakast lunch & dinner with wine & beer is absolutely great a needed break from the noise and activity at the casino floor. special mention to the warm friendly service by Aida & Olivia! üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
20,Stinks. Sketchy people in the casino lobby area. I had the older room. Smelled like mold and cigarettes. Took a shower with my shoes on. Left as soon as the Sun came up. Decent casino and lobby. Upgrade your room if you stay here.
50,Great staff the rooms are fantastic loved the awesome time we had so much fun laughing and winning! The West gate is the bomb!!! I will certainly be back here to see Martha Crawford and Adrienne Hinton!!!
50,Adrienne was a great dealer keeps the game moving and has a great personality that keeps the game enjoyable! The entire staff is welcoming haven‚Äôt come across a dealer or a floor person that wasn‚Äôt great
50,I have came here several years and Adrienne is the best and most friendly dealer and Martha I great floor supervisor and is very Generous with the comps I will continue to visit westgate in vegas they treat you like a king and you feel like family
50,I had the pleasure of working with Mary B at the front desk and she resolved my situation plus went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of! We even shared stories about our animals at home! This is not the level of service offered everywhere so if you get a chance I say check this place out and you won't be disappointed!
50,We are enjoying our stay at Westgate Las Vegas as members of Westgate Timeshare. Great service from the staff at breakfast housekeeping pool gym and shuttle. Thanks for making our stay a memorable one!!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Special kudos to Armyne Ron and Angelick our in-house greeters ‚ò∫Ô∏è
50,We stayed at Westgate hotel last August 2022. Armynne and Angelick were our in house greeters. They provided great service and were very accommodating and helpful. They also adviced on where to go and where to eat in Las Vegas. Overall a great a great experience!
50,To whom this may concern    Angelick was of great spirits and was very empathetic! Was great to have someone not only business swavy but also down to earth and not so bougie. There was a shortage on certain things I was looking for and she came over like she could read my mind and not only reassured me that it would be refilled but refilled it herself! She spoke to my whole family which I found going out her way. With more people like her I would recommend Westgate to everyone I know!    Shareholder at the Westgate  William
50,The hotel was clean and beautiful but more importantly the people were friendly and super helpful. There was a bit of a hiccup with my reservation that was completely my fault but Nora at check in helped me figure it out and everything from there was smooth sailing. Thank you for an awesome stay!
50,I stay at the Westgate regularly as it is right next to the Convention Center and using the Monorail to get around is excellent!  Everything I need is here... Rooms are always clean and service is great..    Now for the good part...  This trip we had a powerful rain with flash flooding in Vegas and here was no different! I was having pizza and some vino when the rain began and then it happened here as in many other properties... a lot of holes opened up so we had an amazing indoor rain as water poured down ... really amazing to see.... next time I'll bring my umbrella.... but for now it's just another great story to share about my ongoing adventures on the road...
50,This was my first time at this hotel and I was delighted to be greeted by Ria. She immediately greeted us with a warm smile and was very courteous. Not only was she nice but also she seemed very engaged in our conversation.
50,The experience I had with Kris Miher a dealer at Westgate was one not that I will never forget. Not because I won because I didn‚Äôt win much but it was his manner when I lost! He made me relax and taught me the game! He has such great people skills! I just really thought he was great! This dealer is the reason I will come back to Westgate!
20,I stayed in Westgate for work and everything is ok for the price and location but yesterday around 12am I was ordering drinks for my coworkers and a bartender named JEFF was absolutely rude. He was giving me actitud and even rolling his eyes because of my English pronunciation. Im sure Westgate deals with a lot of international guests and I don‚Äôt know if he forgot about this or he missed the Costumer service class. I even told him that if he‚Äôs in a bad mood he shouldn‚Äôt come to work and that I will be complaining and he literally moved his shoulders cuz he didn‚Äôt care. Also please keep in mind that I wasn‚Äôt drunk or rude to him for him behaving this way. He was working in the main casino bar and I hope someone has a good talk with him because this is not ok.
50,For those of you looking for an owner's point of view this was my first trip as an owner. The rooms were spacious. I was in an end unit 4 bedroom which actually had 6 hallway doors with soften room numbers. The number of different room keys was annoying but we had plenty of room and were comfortable. The owner's lounge was a treat -- continental breakfast every morning (coffee was a little weak) and snacks/beverages throughout the day. The staff up there (including Aida and Olivia) were very friendly and kept everything stocked and cleaned. It was nice to have a variety of restaurants and shows on the premises and the owner's discount is a big plus (although it's only good for for in your party). The system of charging stuff to the room didn't work like I thought it should but Greg probably spent an hour working to make sure everything was rectified. All in all I felt valued.
50,Rita Palacio from retail helped me out and was the sweetest rep I came across during my entire Vegas trip. Was happy and patient to have me browse around when I didn't know what I was looking for and even helped me choose stuff.  Would 10/10 visit this store again for the super nice customer reps and the experience especially Rita.
10,"We booked four rooms for 5 nights for employees and the hotel was simply awful. Cockroaches on the first night. Room services produced toast that would generously be described as ""once warm bread"" and miserable servings in take out containers.    All four room cards suddenly didn't work at the same times twice. The line at the desk for getting cards reset (and they are *not* because of proximity to phones!) was really long.    And room cleaning? How does the cleaning service ""clean the room"" (I use the term loosely) and not restock anything...like face cloths? And don't even think about calling the front desk for anything. They just don't answer."
50,EXCELLENT service by celestino . He was very attentive to me and my friends needs. Very kind and maintained a smile . He was able to provide us with a good memory photo by allowing us to use a piano display for a foto great foto before closing it down . Thank you!
10,We checked in and was to meet by a concierge who never showed up. After 3 days they finally reached out was to give discounts and shows times and didnt do anything but take us to a breakfast which was horrible. The staff took your plate off the table before we were even done. She to go early due to personal obligations and had no time for usmade us feel we were not important enough to give time too. The rest of the week stay she never reached out. Went to the strip and treasure island offered discounts an show information. Made so many trips to owners desk for help and not once did a manger reach out after we asked for one. The timeshare is a joke. They do not honor any of it. Worst place to stay or have a timeshare at. Got out of mine. Feels great to know I will not have to ever look at this place or ppl again.
50,Excellent we stayed for 7 days the rooms were super comfortable it had a jacuzzi living room dining room good location and good food we were a bit out of time with the cleaning of the room but that was because of us in general highly recommended    less
50,My mom and I accidentally found this band‚Ä¶ Absolutely loved this band. You can feel the talent! High energy and good vibe! üíñüíñüíñ the singer is fun and the member are skilled‚Ä¶. Highly recommend to check them out!
50,Ribka dealer at table games was so much fun to be sitting at her black table!!  Will definitely be looking for her at my next visit to westgate casino in Vegas!!  Great time with her!!!! Her friendly smile was beautiful!!
50,Last night we stay in Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino the amazing hotel I had ever seen in my life. The staff are so cooperative and caring. Breakfastluchdinner are so delicious We played some Blackjack so I decided to return the next day for another stay even though it wasn't part of my plans the receptions greeting are so amazing we love it once again i thank u so much to Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino for making my family tour a memorable tour
50,Stayed on this property for RollerCon 2022 and I loved it!    Check-In was fast and efficient and front desk staff was super friendly. Our room was clean and we had everything we needed for a great stay. When we requested extra toiletries we received them in less than 20 minutes.    Plenty of food and snack options available great for grabbing a quick bite without leaving the resort. Pool area was always clean and well kept.    Elevators were slow but expected due to the high volume of people going up & down with their gear.    Overall it was a great experience and we are hoping to come back next year for Rollercon again (Crossing fingers)
50,Sonthana was such a great help that I decided to return the next day for another stay even though it wasn't part of my plans. She is a professional and I wanted to leave this thank you note for all of Westgate and future visitors to see!
50,Before and after seeing Bronx Wanderers - Great Show! We played some Blackjack Texas HOLD‚ÄôEM and even tried Pai Gow‚Ä¶.we had the best dealer Ribka and went from table to table with her. She was so much fun! Be sure and find her at Westgate Resort Las Vegas!
50,Patricia was amazing she was always there with the next round. Very attentive. Thank you Patricia for making a very enjoyable night. We will definitely see you again. ‚ò∫Ô∏è You are the best cocktail waitress ever. You always take care of us.
40,"PRO's:  I stayed for 4 nights in a ""Signature"" room king bed.  Check in was fast easy and no lines. A little confusion as I was a simple hotel guest and not a timeshare owner.  I was given a room in the ""Center"" tower.  Room was nice size and spacious. 16th floor with an excellent view.  Air conditioning was good.  Bed very comfortable  Cleanliness ok  Bathroom ok.  CON's:  No room cleaning for three days  TV was a joke just snowy fuxx when turning on the after navigating through found 5-7 channels no CNN etc.tried to hook up my laptop to each a movie the TV did not give me access to external devices.  Shower water pressure was limited.  No electrical outlets for a working desk area. The did have a short extension cord to plug into.  No electricity or USB for phone chargi by the bed fortunately I brought my own long extension cord but had to move the bed to access the outlet.  I use a C-Pap so I medically require an electrical outlet by the bed!!  Maid service arrived to change towels a few hours before I was checking out.  OTHER:  Restaurants were good. Sids Cafe was excellent for breakfast and light food. Good easy going service too.  Edge Steakhouse Restaurant was very good but very small portions for a very high price. Service there was average and snobbery.  Easy to access taxis as this is not a regular Hussle bustle hotel like those on the strip.  Transportation good monorail taxis Tesla Loop.  Lots of stores to buy stuff or grab coffee (Starbucks).  Easy but lengthy walk to the convention center all in air conditioning except for a small area via a parking lot.  Elevators good although they're upgrading them.  I liked that not access keys needed to get to the rooms as I was with a few friends and wanted them to come visit whenever they wanted without me having ylto keep going downstairs to meet them. Hopefully that won't change.  I would stay here again."
50,Gotta say Aida and Kelsie are so cool great in house greeters they made sure this lounge had everything to make all us in here enjoying our stay and Kevin Obrian made sure the rest of our stay was exceptional
50,Kay Johnson was so helpful Great first impression for the westgate. Made us feel very welcomed even told us about the different events going on and the great food places to eat during the day. Will definitely stay again
30,Good stay and good customer service. They let us check in at noon for a $25 fee which was well worth it. Fast check in. Room was nice with huge shower and a 50‚Äù TV. Pool was decent and uncrowded. Casino is medium sized and clean and good air. Westgate is at a monorail station so it‚Äôs easy fast and cheap to visit the rest of the strip. Fresco Italian restaurant was good with huge portions and reasonable prices. All customer service interactions were great. What made this trip average rather than excellent was the elevator situation. Long lines long waits. Packed like sardines when you got one. Then the ride took forever as they stopped at every floor as people were waiting on every floor. This got old  fast. I don‚Äôt go on vacation to stand in line. I won‚Äôt be back because of this.
40,This is the hotel we‚Äôre Elvis sang. Many pictures for fans and very nice rooms. I rated 4 stars because the only way to get coffee is to pay Starbucks prices No complimentary coffee in lobby and no coffee maker in rooms.
50,Mr Westgate went out of his way to show us around to all the Elvis displays and had the Elvis gift shop opened for us.He opened a private lobby for us to see various pictures. Very friendly and knowledgeable. Five stars
50,Rooms are always available and nice cleanas wells bargain for the price. Beds are very comfortable. Check in line wasn't long like the strip hotels and the staff is much friendlier too. I recommend that you give the Westgate a try.
10,I recently went to Vegas for summerleague and stayed at Westgate. It was okay getting in and checkin was fairly smooth. However we immediately smelled marijauna when entering our room. I texted the front desk and told them the issue we had. Since it was late we said we would stay the night and move in the morning or have them freshen up the room. At 1:45am we heard someone trying to get in our room! They then got in with a room key and it was housekeeping who were coming to clean up our room at 1:45am! We said to come back much later. They did clean the the room the next day but that was the only day they came by. It is to far out of the way as it is a block off the strip as well. The restaurant choices are not great SIDS is slow- over an hour waiting. Some staff are good  some are terrible selling shows but not knowing what is playing. Overall a poor experience!  RI  British Columbia
50,What a FUN and entertaining band! They sure know how to keep the crowd engaged! Great music and performance! Love the song selections! My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the music and dancing! Everyone around us had too much fun on this Friday night! Talented group of musicians!
40,This was my first time in Vegas. We booked the Westgate because its affordable and has great reviews. We were not disappointed.    The hotel is super clean! There is a lovely smell throughout the hotel.  The rooms nice bathrooms could use an upgrade.    Quiet pool. Wish there was a bit more action but the pool bar food was delicious.    Lots of places to eat... during the day. We arrived at night and only one small cafe was still open with sandwiches and pizza.    We tried their Fresh buffet and it was really good! They had crab legs and everything you could want. I enjoyed it.    There's a decent sized casino as well.    The monorail is what makes this hotel worth staying at. Its right outside the front doors and takes you to the main strip in minutes . It was also nice getting away from the main strip action at night to a more relaxed atmosphere.    Its also walking distance to a cannabis store which is nice also if thats what you're into    We frequented the souvenir shop in the main lobby a lot they had cheap beers there. We would grab a giant beer and then take it to the strip ... saves a bit of money !    Overall i would visit again. I would probably try a different hotel next time just so i could be on the strip but if thats something you dont mind  i would definitely recommend this hotel.
10,We stayed 4 nights and moved to 3 different rooms. I have allergies and they smoked in the hotel so it smelled bad and air was a problem also broke items in the room. This was for my friends 60th birthday but it ended up horrible.
10,The Westgate is a two star hotel at best. First night we ate at Sid's cafe and the food was barely warm. Tried the buffet the following day for lunch and it was disastrous; congealed gravy tough meat and overall unsanitary conditions. Back to Sid's to try again and suspect food had been poorly microwaved...hot outside cold inside. Tried take-out food from the mexican. It tasted good and was hot but they forgot to add the crema to the tacos so was awfully dry but still edible and the best meal we had there.  The room itself was large but they hadn't cleaned it well from the last checkout as there was some garbage still there and a few things in the drawers.  Our housekeeper took one of my shirts out with the laundry of towels and bedding (I presume in error). I was told to go to the front desk where they told me nothing could be done as they use an outsourced laundry service. No accountability at all.  This was our second stay there. We had been 4 years ago and ended up moving to the Flamingo after one night due to unclean room. We figured after 4 years they may have improved. We won't be trying a third time!  At one of the convention parties (green night) they didn't supply enough chairs for everyone which was difficult to understand seeing as how tickets were paid for in advance.  It's a shame as the convention is always fun. Have never missed one! But will stay elsewhere next time.
50,Snacks were plentiful and coffee hot! Wonderful atmosphere! Great friendly staff! Came  Every morning and was never disappointed! Definitely would come back and enjoy the food drinks and wonderful service!
50,we loved our stay at the Westgate. The monorail made getting between the hotel and the strip extremely convenient and low cost. Our room was updated and fresh. The bed was extremely comfortable. We will definitely be staying again soon!
50,Lyndia was so helpful fun and enthusiastic  Checking in was a pleasure. Great first impression for the westgate. Made us feel welcome and gave us full run down of amenities. If I were you I'd give her a raise immediately.
50,I had the best time the pit crew at the Westgate is amazing special special shout out to Erica... And all the rest of the crew was amazing they they treated me like a Queen with respect and did everything they could to make me happy. Well it worked I'm going home today and I will definitely come back and visit the next time I am in Vegas...
50,I have seen Bronx 7 times now and this show is so good and the musicians are very professional and do a great show everytime. They do the best rendition of the Bohemian Rhapsody. My favorate part is all the drumming into Hawaii 5 0 .they are awsome. Dont miss this show. Thia show is for younger and mature audience.
50,Front Desk Greeter  Chester was very Good.  Jordan and Her Mgr and the Entire Crew / Staff of timeshare w/ Linda was Awesome !  In House Greeter was very Friendly and Good Service  Overall our stay here Fabulous and Amazing.  Thank You all very much.
30,The old saying is you get what you pay for and certainly that is the case with the Westgate.  Pros: Budget friendly amenities such as restaurants pool etc. on property Extra big pro was the convenience of there being a monorail stop at this location that took you to various places on the strip.  Cons: Hotel overbooked rooms and tried to give us a room with less beds then we booked no in room coffee maker is a MAJOR con! Casino area is fairly small. Major Con- the elevator situation in the morning waited close to 30 minutes to get downstairs from our floor due to so many people using it.
50,It‚Äôs been such a delight to welcomed so friendly each morning for breakfast by all of the staff. But especially by Angelick EVERY morning she is all smiles cheery welcoming and quick to provide whatever you need. I looked forward to seeing her smiling face each day!
50,Such a wonderful person. So nice and friendly. I highly recommend her for anything. Check in yesterday was a nightmare with the computer system being down and all. She was still smiling after being on her feet for so long!
10,The incompetence of the reservation/front desk crew was amazing. I get prioritizing vip guests-but literally 500 people forced to wait for three desk clerks? Some brain cells spent on realizing how much money you‚Äôre losing while 500 people stand for hours? Basic rule guys-you hunt ducks WHEN they are flying!!
50,It was our first time in Vegas and we were staying at The Westgate. Immediately upon arrival we were greeted by Mr. Westgate who was extremely welcoming and helpful in guiding our explorations. He recommended places to eat and visit and every recommendation was amazing. We had a great time and felt like we got to experience a little of everything Vegas had to offer.
50,We had a Cabana at Westgate resort for entire week of July fourth to July seventh it was amazing and well worth spending on irene s. took care of us most of week and she was fantastic by far the favorite of the 3
50,Great service by Ron Loreal and Maria M at the Westgate Owners Lounge!  Keep up the great customer service!  Area was always clean and food was quickly restocked.  The Happy Hour is a great way to start off the evening!
50,Mr Westgate was awesome. He took pictures with me and my fiance took pictures of us and gave awesome recommendations for Vegas and The Westgate Hotel. I will definitely visit again maybe for Christmas and hope see him dressed for the holiday festivities!
50,Awesome stay! Mr. Westgate was the best! So friendly and VERY patriotic! We truly enjoyed our 5 days at Westgate. All staff were so helpful and accommodating from the teenage lifeguards to Johnny behind the bar. Thank you!
50,Spotlessly clean and airy inside Good choice of food and the staff and the cleaners are very attentative to guest needs. Visited MGM Paris the Venetian Wynns and the Bellagio . None of these hotels dissapoint easy to get to on the Monorail 10 dollars return .Great choice of shows in the evening. Relax during the daytime in the pool;
50,I‚Äôve been to Vegas twice and stayed at the Westgate twice. Love it. Everything I need. Food entertainment games tattoo parlor everything! Family and I all stayed and enjoyed several dinners breakfasts the magic show!
10,My family and I stayed at the WG resort for 4 days..we reserved 5 rooms in total. During those days I changed rooms 4 times. The last time I changed rooms was because bugs was in one of the double beds. My mom complained of itching while laying down the night before the bugs was discovered. I reported the incident to the hotel mgr who switched us to another room and comped my resort fee. A report was filed with the hotel Preliminary investigator who came into the infested room to take the report. I took a pic of one of the bugs before my mom discarded it. When I showed the investigator the bug she asked if the pic can be lightened. She and I begin to go back & forth about the bug. Then My elderly mom chimes in and said she smashed one with paper and trashed it. She asked where ‚Ä¶as If we were  Making it up (that was the impression I got). Then mom  Proceeds to go to the trash can. I told her we are not fetching bugs out the trash and If she needed more evidence she (investigator) can fetch it out. Moms insisted on showing her the bug so investigator watched as moms located the tissue the bug was in as I was yelling her not to dig in the trash. Needless to say she got the evidence she was looking for. Moms also had what appeared to be a bite mark on her back. In addition to the bugs the sink was leaking. The new room that we moved into shower was leaking and toilet didn‚Äôt flush properly. The kicker was I was actually charged 26 cents for incidentals‚Ä¶    On the other hand One of the two best experiences at the hotel was the Motown show and Mr. Westgate. Mr. Westgate is such a pleasant sight and joy to see. His outfits matched his personality he was the highlight of our stay at the resort. I would rate both a 5 but rooms a 1. Indefinitely wouldn‚Äôt stay there anymore and I‚Äôm a frequent Vegas visitor.
50,Maria M. in the Owners Club was very pleasant and humble. She was pure joy to talk to and ask questions regarding things to do in Vegas! She offered to take our pictures and refill our glasses of wine. I will definitely be back tomorrow hopefully she working tomorrow evening!
50,Lyndia was amazing! The absolute sweetest employee anyone could ever ask her for.

40,I planned a weekend to celebrate my sons birthday with family. I was looking for a property that wasnt super expensive because it was close to a holiday. I decided to try Westgate and was happy about my decision. Westgate is not close to the strip which we were happy about but has easy access to the Monorail which took us quickly to heart of the strip and back. The hotel has all the same ammenities many other hotels have ie. pool gaming restarurants sportsbook bars etc. In addition we watched the Mowtown Review show and it was outstanding. However the highlight of my trip was Mr. Westgate!! When we arrived he immediately greeted us  was attentative and professional!! During my stay we had a couple of questions and I went directly to Mr. Westgate. He not only made sure our needs were met but checked in on us daily. His energy is unmatched and service is like no other staff person I have encountered at any hotel!
50,Very festive! Family visited the Owners Lounge at westgate Las Vegas during the 4th of July weekend decor was very nice we were greeted by Ron Glenda Kelsie and Maria M the in house greeters they were very attentaive and accommodating for our family. We really appreciate good customer service.
50,Enjoyed our stay at Westgate LV. Room upgrades are in progress can't wait to be back in a few years to see what has improved    Armynne Sanai Ron and Angelick we our amazing inhouse greeters at the Westgate Club. Always simling and welcoming us....thank you guys!
50,We stayed five nights at the Westgate for a convention and have to say the service has been exceptional. At a time when every business is suffering from staffing problems the Westgate is blessed with great people. Food gaming sports book pool and service has all been great!    But if you have an opportunity to visit the Westgate I hope you get to meet ‚Äú Mr. Westgate‚Äù a true star among a fantastic staff!
10,I am switching hotels. Housekeeping is unfriendly. It's Off the strip so you are far away from the action. TV doesn't work on most channels that you want to watch and maintenance guy says it's that way in all the rooms here. Front desk is friendly though.
50,The VIP room was awesome because if the staff‚ÄîArmynne Sanai and Ron. They were very pleasant to speak with and helpful whenever I went to the 24th floor lounge.    I stayed in the north tower for about a week.
50,Armynne Sanai and Ron were very welcoming professional and helpful. They made our time here that much better. We are very appreciative of their kindness and hope they continue with their successes..
50,Spent 12 days at the westgate for the NAFCSC Celtic convention.  Great hotel although off the main strip the Monorail is on the doorstep and is an excellent way to get up and down the strip.    The newly updated rooms are amazing comfortable beds and pristine decor.    Staff always so helpful special mention though to Chris from the security team. Not an easy task monitoring a large scale pool party Chris on the entrance took this in his stride whilst remaining professional and friendly with all in attendance.    The hotel has many food options buffet breakfast / lunch is great for the price  the Staff in sids stand out as really friendly and attentive great meal and recommendations from them.    Fully recommend a visit to iblow salon on site friendly staff that work wonders on hair and make up    Roll on 2023!
40,Loreal and Aida were great. Department In House. The food was great. They were friendly and mannerable. The eating area was clean and they kept the station of food stocked and it was a clean space to eat
50,Kudos to the entire staff of the in-house greeter Westgate Club. Armynne Sanai Michael and the entire staff were the greatest! Our 4th trip at the resort and they were perfect!!! We will be returning.
50,Roni and Aida were not only courteous polite and friendly but they also gave us tips about the Westgate shuttle and what to try in the area. We wouldn‚Äôt have know about these tips without them‚Ä¶and we‚Äôve been here for almost a week already so these aren‚Äôt brochure-level tips; they are insider-level tips! Thank you so much :)
50,Great experience with Ron and Aida in House Greeter at Club Owner accommodation for their smiles and friendliness. We love to come back.    View from the hotel is excellent. Complementary shuttle to the Strip is enjoyable.
50,Kelsie is extremely nice and courteous I was surprised she wasn‚Äôt a manager. She‚Äôs very caring and deserves a promotion she was nice to everyone and it showed. Glenda and Aida were professional as well. Kelsie was especially special and has a spark of light in her personality!
50,Fantastic service and watching Jimmy working outside was making me tried. The guy works his ass off with service of opening doorscalling a cab and always with a smile. Great hospitality. My stay here was also great. Cleanfood was yummybeds were comfortable
50,Had a fantastic time at the the NAFCSC Celtic convention at the Westgate. As always it was very well organised and the hotel and staff were top notch. Plenty of choices to eat and drink within the resort and lots of small stores etc. The room I had was fantastic... spacious and comfortable. And the view from window was fantastic. Monorail station is right next to the hotel and will take you to the rest of the Vegas strip. They also have a shuttle to take you to Fremont Street... And there's always plenty of taxis at the door.  The pool is fantastic and the staff were excellent throughout the week I was there especially for the pool party which is very memorable.  That is the 3rd time I have attended the NAFCSC Convention at the Westgate and it did not disappoint. I would recommend to anyone this hotel and this event.
40,Celtic convention was fabulous as usual..nice to see updated renovated comfortable rooms as well! We had a great time as usual..only one comment would be to have a snack bar open later than 10 pm as sometimes we get peckish for some burgers etc and not always in the mood for the deli‚Ä¶.but overall had a great time! If they could put a coffee machine in the rooms that would be awesome!!
50,Hotel staff facilities are all class had a great week there can't wait to visit again monorail 2 mins walk easy access to downtown strip plenty to see and do never get bored in vegas see you soon can't wait
40,Had an amazing time at the Glasgow Celtic Convention in June 2022. Hotel accommodated all the fans and the pool party was a blast! I would absolutely go back. Food is also top shelf. It‚Äôs also on the monorail so it‚Äôs very convenient.
50,Fantastic weeks stay in the Westgate. We were looked after by Agustine who I cant recommend enough. Superb service all week (Celtic Convention üçÄ ) with the hotel staff and they even joined in on some of the entertainment. Will definetly return in 2023. Great to have coffee shop open 24hrs would like to have seen the food court at sports book open a bit later than 11pm but other than that cant fault the hotel or staff. See you in 2023! ‚òòÔ∏è
50,Our family have stayed at the Westgate for the Celtic Conventions as well as other visits to Vegas. We love the hotel and staff. The prices are great and the monorail is so convenient.

50,Viva Las Vegas what a holiday location I attended the North American Federation of Celtic Supporters Clubs Convention in the Westgate Hotel and had a ball.  The rooms were very comfortable the air conditioning worked a treat the food and beverages were excellent and the staff truly understood customer service.    The Celtic family were made most welcome there was a carnival atmosphere and the resort was ideally placed to give us access via the monorail to the delightsof Vegas.    I can't wait till my next visit. hh üíö
